U||o make the fullest use 
U||of them, during a journey I made through Persia and 
U||down the Persian Gulf, as well as to different points 
U||of the Indian frontier, in the autumn and winter of 
U||1902-3, before and after attending the Coronation 
U||Durbar at Delhi. In order to place before my readers 
U||a more complete survey of the question which I had 
U||outlined in those letters, I have not merely revised 
U||them and brought them, as far as possible, up to date, 
U||but I have, to some extent, recast them, and introduced 
U||a large amount of altogether new material. 
U||I must leave these pages to speak for themselves ; 
U||but as the book I published early in 1896 on The Far 
U||Eastern Question was, I think, the first to call public 
U||attention to the gravity of the problems with which, 
U||as the result of the war between China and Japan, we 
U||were about to be confronted in Eastern Asia, I may 
U||perhaps, without too much presumption, be allowed 
U||to say that the more subtle changes of which I have 
U||attempted to describe the progress in Middle Asia 
U||appear to me to be fraught with consequences of even 
U||greater moment to the British Empire. 
U||In Persia especially — where I had travelled eighteen 
U||years before, on my way back from a journey to India 
U||— it was sufficient to compare the conditions that pre- 
U||vailed there in 1884 1902 in order to be im- 
U||pressed with the rapidity with which events are now 
U||VIH 
U||PREFACE 
U||moving even in the immutable East. Under the 
U||impact of Western forces the disintegration of Asia 
U||is proceeding apace, and new conditions are being 
U||evolved which, within a period perhaps no longer 
U||very remote, will seriously affect, both directly and 
U||indirectly, the position of our Indian Empire. For 
U||the pressure of European ambitions successively trans- 
U||ferred from the already overcrowded stage of our own 
U||small continent to the more spacious stage of Asia is 
U||destined to rob India of the precious advantages of a 
U||quasi-msvXax position she has hitherto derived from 
U||the survival, all along her land frontiers, of decadent 
U||Oriental states, incapable of any serious aggressive 
U||effort, and thus to draw her more and more into the 
U||forefront of international politics. I hope I may have 
U||done something to convince the reader that issues arc 
U||involved therein of which we, as a nation, can least of 
U||all afford to overlook or to underrate the importance. 
U||I have collected in an Appendix some of the most im- 
U||portant international treaties and extracts from official 
U||correspondence bearing on the subject. The Royal 
U||Geographical Society have been good enough to allow 
U||me to use one of their maps of Persia and adjoining 
U||regions, and I must crave the indulgence of the reader 
U||in the few cases in which the spelling of geographical 
U||names in the text diverges from that of the maps. The 
U||illustrations are taken from water-colour sketches which 
U||I made during my journey, or from photographs mostly 
U||taken by my travelling companion, Mr. Murray Stewart, 
U||who has kindly placed them at my disposal.

U||THE 
U||MIDDLE EASTERN QUESTION 
U||CHAPTER I 
U||THE MIDDLE EASTERN QUESTION DEFINED 
U||AT the close of the very weighty speech with which 
U||the Viceroy of India concluded the Budget debate 
U||in the Indian Council at Calcutta this year (March 25th, 
U||1903) occurs the following remarkable passage : — 
U||There is one final subject that is rarely mentioned 
U||in these debates, and that finds little place in the many 
U||utterances which the head of the Government is called 
U||upon to make in the course of the year, and yet in a sense 
U||it is the most important of all. I allude to Foreign 
U||Affairs ; and it must be remembered that in the case 
U||of India the phrase includes her relations with the 
U||whole of her neighbours, and that this carries with 
U||it the politics of the greater part of the Asiatic Conti- 
U||nent. I doubt if even the thoughtful public has at 
U||all realised the silent but momentous change that is 
U||going on, and that will one day have an effect upon 
U||India that is at present but dimly discerned. In the 
U||old days, and it may almost be said up to the 
U||last fifteen years, the foreign relations of India were 
U||practically confined to her dealings with Afghanistan, 
U||and to the designs or movements of the great Power 
U||B 
U||2 . 
U||THE MIDDLE EASTERN QUESTION DEFINED 
U||beyond ; and the foreign policy of India had little to 
U||do with any other foreign nation. It is true that we 
U||had territories or outposts of influence that brought 
U||us into contact with Persia and Turkey, and that we 
U||had occasional dealings with Arabian tribes. Now all 
U||that is changed, and events are passing which are 
U||gradually drawing this country, once so isolated 
U||and remote, into the vortex of the world’s politics, 
U||and that will materially affect its future. The change 
U||has been due to two reasons. Firstly, as our own 
U||dominion has expanded, and our influence upon our 
U||frontier consolidated, we have been brought into more 
U||direct and frequent relations with the countries lying 
U||immediately beyond. For instance, the annexation of 
U||Upper Burma brought us into contact with an im- 
U||portant corner of the Chinese Empire, and created a 
U||batch of frontier and other political problems of its 
U||own. But the second reason is much more important. 
U||Europe has woke up, and is beginning to take a revived 
U||interest in Asia. Russia with her vast territories, her 
U||great ambitions, and her unarrested advance, has been 
U||the pioneer in this movement, and with her, or after her, 
U||have come her competitors, rivals, and allies. Thus, 
U||as all these foreigners arrive upon the scene and push 
U||forward into the vacant spots, we are slowly having a 
U||European situation recreated in Asia, with the same 
U||figures upon the stage. The great European Powers 
U||are also becoming the great Asiatic Powers. Already 
U||we have Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany, and 
U||Turkey ; and then, in place of all the smaller European 
U||kingdoms and principalities, we have the empires and 
U||states of the East— Japan, China, Tibet, Siam, Afghan- 
U||istan, Persia, only a few of them strong and robust, 
U||the majority containing the seeds of inevitable decay. 
U||There lie in these events and in this renewed contact 
U||or collision, as the case may be, between the East and 
U||the West, omens of the greatest significance to this 
U||country. Europe is so accurately parcelled out between 
U||ASIA IN FLUX AND SOLUTION 
U||3 
U||the various States and Powers, the balance of power 
U||is suspended on so fine a thread, and the slightest 
U||disturbance would imperil such wide interests, that 
U||short of some serious and unforeseen convulsion, which 
U||everyone would wish to avert, great changes are not 
U||to be anticipated there. Africa is rapidly being over- 
U||run by the few European Powers who have obtained 
U||a foothold upon that continent, and before long its 
U||political destinies and territorial grouping will have 
U||taken something like definite shape. But in Asia a 
U||great deal is still in flux and solution, and there must, 
U||and there will, be great changes. It will be well to 
U||realise what an effect these must have upon India, and 
U||how they must add to our responsibilities and cares. 
U||Our Indian dominions now directly touch those of 
U||Turkey in many parts of the Arabian peninsula, those 
U||of Russia on the Pamirs, those of China along the 
U||entire border of Turkestan and Yunnan, those of 
U||France on the Upper Mekong. In our dealings with 
U||them the Foreign Department in India is becoming 
U||the Asiatic branch of the Foreign Office in England. 
U||Then round all our borders is the fringe of Asiatic 
U||states to which I just now alluded, whose integrity 
U||and whose freedom from hostile influence are vital 
U||to our welfare, but over whose future the clouds are 
U||beginning to gather. In Europe we are a maritime 
U||Power who are merely called upon to defend our own 
U||shores from invasion, and who are confronted by no 
U||land dangers or foes. In Asia we have both a seaboard 
U||and a land frontier many thousands of miles in length, 
U||and though Providence has presented us on some 
U||portion of our land frontiers with the most splendid 
U||natural defences in the world, yet the situation must 
U||become more and not less anxious as rival or hostile 
U||influences creep up to these ramparts, and as the 
U||ground outside them becomes the arena of new com- 
U||binations and the field of unforeseen ambitions. All 
U||these circumstances will tend — they are already tending 
U||4 THE MIDDLE EASTERN QUESTION DEFINED 
U||— to invest the work of the Indian Foreign Department 
U||with ever-increasing importance, and they demand a 
U||vigilance and a labour of which there are but few 
U||indications in anything that reaches the public ear or 
U||falls under the public eye. Questions of internal develop- 
U||ment, administrative anxieties, agrarian and fiscal 
U||problems, fill all our minds, just as they have occupied 
U||the greater part of my speech this afternoon. But do 
U||not let the people of India think that we shall never 
U||have anything but domestic cares in this country. Do 
U||not let them forget that there are other and not inferior 
U||duties that devolve upon her rulers, that the safety 
U||of the Indian frontier, and the maintenance of the 
U||British dominion in those parts of Asia where it has 
U||for long been established, and where it is the surest, 
U||if not the sole, guarantee for peace and progress, are 
U||in their hands, and that this, no less than internal 
U||reform, is part of England’s duty. I see no reason 
U||for anticipating trouble upon our borders, and I know 
U||of no question that is at present in an acute or menacing 
U||phase. But do not let anyone, on the strength of that, 
U||go to sleep in the happy illusion that anxiety will never 
U||come. The geographical position of India will more 
U||and more push her into the forefront of international 
U||politics. She will more and more become the strategical 
U||frontier of the British Empire. All these are circum- 
U||stances that should give us food for reflection, and that 
U||impose upon us the duty of incessant watchfulness and 
U||precaution. They require that our forces shall be in a 
U||high state of efficiency, our defences secure, and our 
U||schemes of policy carefully worked out and defined. 
U||Above all, they demand a feeling of solidarity and 
U||common interest among those — and they include 
U||every inhabitant of this country, from the Raja to 
U||the Raiat — whose interests are wrapped up in the 
U||preservation of the Indian Empire, both for the sake 
U||of India itself and for the wider good of mankind.” 
U||THE FUTURE OF ASIA 
U||5 
U||In these pregnant sentences Lord Curzon defined, 
U||with the authority belonging alike to his intimate know- 
U||ledge of Asiatic countries and peoples and to the high 
U||office he holds under the Crown, the question with 
U||which British statesmanship is confronted in what 
U||Captain Mahan has aptly christened ^‘The Middle 
U||East,” that is to say, in those regions of Asia which 
U||extend to the borders of India or command the ap- 
U||proaches to India, and which are consequently bound 
U||up with the problems of Indian political as well as 
U||military defence. The Middle Eastern Question is 
U||itself only a part of a much larger question upon 
U||which the future of Asia depends. It is not indeed 
U||a new question, for it has occupied the minds of 
U||far-sighted statesmen for generations past. It is a 
U||continuation of the same question with which we have 
U||long been familiar in the Near East. It is closely con- 
U||nected with the more novel development of international 
U||rivalry in the Far East. It is the outcome of that con- 
U||stant projection of European forces — moral, commercial, 
U||and military — into Asia which is slowly but steadily 
U||transforming all the conditions that enabled us to 
U||achieve, and so far to retain, as the masters of India, a 
U||position of unparalleled ascendency in the Asiatic 
U||Continent. 
U||Owing partly to the innate conservatism of the 
U||British mind, which is both self-reliant and slow to 
U||move, prone to criticism yet fundamentally optimistic, 
U||and partly to the immense complexity of our national 
U||interests scattered over a world-wide Empire which has 
U||been built up by a series of individual efforts rather 
U||than by any uniform and collective design, we are apt 
U||as a nation to take things as we find them, and having 
U||no reason to be dissatisfied with them on the whole, ^ve 
U||6 THE MIDDLE EASTERN QUESTION DEFINED 
U||are also disposed to assume that they will go on as they 
U||are, without troubling ourselves over-much about the 
U||unceasing changes which are going on around us, and 
U||which, without making themselves so directly and visibly 
U||felt as to compel public attention, are constantly and 
U||materially affecting the ground upon which we stand 
U||in our relations to the outside world. Considered solely 
U||as an absolute quantity, our position in Asia, with which 
U||it will be generally agreed that our whole position as 
U||an Empire is largely bound up, is as strong as, if not 
U||stronger than, it has ever been. Can the same be said 
U||of it if we consider it not as an absolute but as a 
U||relative quantity, i.e. in relation to the various other 
U||quantities which make up the great political equation 
U||of the balance of Asiatic power? Not to speak for the 
U||moment of the great continental powers of Europe, has 
U||the value of those other quantities in the equation, 
U||which are called Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, China, 
U||Tibet, Siam, remained constant? or has it not, on the 
U||contrary, varied so considerably as to modify very 
U||seriously, and in most cases to our detriment, all the 
U||conditions of the equation ? Whether such variations 
U||are due to internal or to external causes, they necessarily 
U||affect the problem as a whole, and it will be my object in 
U||the following pages to try and measure their real im- 
U||portance and to indicate some of the consequences 
U||which must inevitably ensue from them.

U||CHAPTER II 
U||THE PERSIAN ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM 
U||O F the factors of the Middle Eastern question which 
U||most closely affect our position in India, Persia 
U||is, with Afghanistan, the most important. Nowhere 
U||certainly can the conditions which are transforming the 
U||Asiatic situation be studied with greater profit. Nearly 
U||fourteen years have elapsed since the present Viceroy 
U||of India wrote for The Times the admirable series of 
U||letters which he subsequently embodied and developed 
U||in his exhaustive work, Persia and the Persian Question 
U||— a work that deservedly ranks as the most important 
U||modern contribution to our knowledge of the condition 
U||of Persia and to a proper understanding of the part she 
U||is destined to play, whether actively or passively, in 
U||the history of Asiatic politics. Persia herself remains 
U||to-day exactly the same inert organism that Lord 
U||Curzon described in 1889-90, but her inertia has not 
U||been proof against the influence of the motive forces 
U||which have been closing in upon her in the interval. 
U||Nor is it only that she has herself suffered changes 
U||which are none the less significant because they have 
U||been forced upon her. The events which have taken 
U||place in Asia outside of Persia have reacted upon 
U||Persia herself with a force, which unaided, she has 
U||been powerless to resist. She has been gradually 
U||7 
U||8 THE PERSIAN ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM 
U||caught up and overwhelmed in the vortex of inter- 
U||national ambitions, which she could neither escape nor 
U||control. 
U||Up to quite the end of the eighteenth century Persia 
U||had never been seriously thought of in Europe as a 
U||political factor. All that was known of her had been 
U||learnt from the narratives — singularly copious and 
U||romantic — of the merchant adventurers who had from 
U||time to time sought more or less successfully to open 
U||up trade relations with her from Western Europe. 
U||Curiously enough it was the British Moscovy Com- 
U||pany ’’ that first attempted, in the days when Ivan the 
U||Terrible reigned at Moscow and the good Queen Bess 
U||over these islands, to tap the trade of Persia in British 
U||interests by way of the Volga and the Caspian in 
U||competition with the Portuguese galleons that already 
U||sailed the Persian Gulf. There are few stranger pages 
U||of history when read in the light of the present situation 
U||than the records of that Company and of its successor, 
U||the British Russia Company, which for two centuries 
U||applied themselves repeatedly, and with fluctuating 
U||fortunes, to conquer the markets of Persia for British 
U||trade from a Russian base. Their ultimate failure 
U||coincides with the period when British enterprise, which 
U||had been seeking access for some time past both from 
U||the Mediterranean and from India to the southern 
U||markets of Persia, at last succeeded in securing a strong 
U||foothold on the Persian Gulf. The British Caspian 
U||trade was abolished by a decree of the Empress 
U||Catherine of Russia in 1746, and the last English 
U||factories in Northern Persia were abandoned in 1749. 
U||In 1763 the Shah Kerim Khan issued a solemn firman 
U||to ‘‘the Right Worshipful William Andrew Price, 
U||Esquire, Governor-General for the English nation in 
U||OUR FIRST RELATIONS WITH PERSIA 
U||9 
U||the Gulf of Persia,” granting important rights and 
U||privileges for the establishment of a factory at Bushire, 
U||and for the sending of British goods customs free all 
U||over the kingdom of Persia. It is true that long before 
U||that date there had been commercial relations between 
U||India and Persia, and British factories in the Gulf, 
U||both at Jask and at Gombroon, or Bunder Abbas, as 
U||it is now called. A British commercial agent had even 
U||resided at Isfahan. But British enterprise in the South 
U||had had to fight the ground inch by inch against other 
U||European rivals, Portuguese, Dutch, and French in 
U||succession, and it was not till the second half of the 
U||eighteenth century that that British commercial as- 
U||cendency was established, which in the course of the 
U||following century grew into an unchallenged monopoly 
U||of political influence in the Persian Gulf, extending 
U||from its shores far into the interior of Southern and 
U||Central Persia, and even to the Persian Court in the 
U||north. 
U||It was the devouring genius of the first Napoleon and 
U||his gigantic schemes of world conquest which led for 
U||the first time about a hundred years ago to the establish- 
U||ment of official diplomatic relations, and to the conclu- 
U||sion of an important political treaty between this country 
U||and Persia. The conquests of Nadir Shah, who had 
U||carried the victorious arms of Persia down to Delhi in 
U||1739, and of Ahmed Shah Abdali, who after Nadir’s 
U||death proclaimed himself independent sovereign of the 
U||Afghans, and had led them down repeatedly to plunder 
U||the cities and overrun the plains of Northern India, had 
U||brought home to the British rulers of Hindustan the 
U||ever-present danger of invasion from the North. As 
U||lately as 1796, Zeman Shah, a grandson of Ahmed

U||professed purpose of rescuing the Moghul dynasty from 
U||the domination of the Mahrattas. It is not surprising 
U||in these circumstances that British statesmen should 
U||have trembled for the safety of our Indian possessions 
U||when it became known in 1800 that a scheme was being 
U||planned in Europe for a fresh invasion of India from 
U||Central Asia, under the joint auspices of France and 
U||Russia. Not only had the scheme been discussed 
U||between Napoleon and the Tsar Paul, but preparations 
U||were actually made on the Volga for the despatch of a 
U||Russian force, and a secret embassy had been sent 
U||from France to Teheran to arrange for the passage of 
U||a French army, which was to join hands with the 
U||Russians in the plains of Northern India. The whole 
U||scheme was upset by the assassination of the Tsar in 
U||March, 1801, but the British Government had already 
U||taken steps effectually to thwart one of its main features. 
U||Lord Wellesley, then Governor-General of India, had 
U||despatched Captain John Malcolm to Persia, and in 
U||January a treaty of defensive alliance had been success- 
U||fully concluded with Fath Ali Shah, under which his 
U||Persian Majesty bound himself, in return for definite 
U||promises of material assistance, to attack the Afghans 
U||in the event of their attempting to invade India, and to 
U||prevent the French from ‘‘establishing themselves on 
U||any of the islands or shores of Persia.’’ A few years 
U||later, however, in 1805, hostilities broke out, not 
U||between Persia and France, but at the instigation of 
U||the latter, between Persia and Russia, with whom we 
U||were then in alliance against France. Hard pressed 
U||by the Russians in Georgia, the Shah appealed to us 
U||for assistance, pledging himself in return to abandon 
U||the French alliance, under which Napoleon was to 
U||help him to recover the provinces conquered by 
U||NAPOLEON I.’s GREAT SCHEME 
U||II 
U||Russia, and Persia was to declare war against England 
U||and, as had been already contemplated in 1800, give 
U||passage to a French army for the invasion of India. 
U||The British Government naturally held that the Treaty 
U||of 1801 had contemplated quite a different casus foe^ 
U||derisy and the Persian overtures were rejected, where- 
U||upon Path Ali Shah threw himself altogether into 
U||the arms of Napoleon. General Gardanne arrived in 
U||Teheran in 1807 ^.s the political and military pleni- 
U||potentiary of the French Emperor, who was then at 
U||the height of his power, and proceeded with the help 
U||of a large staff of French officers to reorganise and 
U||equip the Persian Army on European lines. 
U||But the Treaty of Tilsit, which had entirely changed 
U||Napoleon's policy towards Russia, cooled the ardour 
U||of the Persian monarch for a French alliance, which 
U||he had accepted with an eye to the recovery of his 
U||Caucasian provinces, rather than with any deliberate 
U||purpose of hostility towards England. The Indian 
U||Government, which had taken steps to consolidate 
U||its relations with the frontier states by despatching 
U||missions to the Ameers of Sind, to the Sikh chief- 
U||tains, and to the ruler of Kabul, where Mr. Elphin- 
U||stone concluded a treaty specifically directed against 
U||the French and Persian ‘‘confederacy,” again des- 
U||patched Sir John Malcolm to Persia. By one of those 
U||strange confusions partly due to departmental jealousy 
U||and partly to official carelessness and the want of 
U||proper co-ordination of our Imperial forces, which 
U||have been so frequently and seriously detrimental to 
U||British interests in Persia, the home Government 
U||appointed at the same time without reference to India a 
U||plenipotentiary of its own to proceed direct to Teheran, 
U||Sir Harford Jones. The conflict of authority between 
U||12 THE PERSIAN ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM 
U||these two representatives, and the contradictory in- 
U||structions which they kept on receiving from Calcutta 
U||and from London, were not conducive to successful 
U||diplomacy. Nevertheless, though often at cross-pur- 
U||poses, our diplomacy “muddled through” in the end. 
U||On March 15th, 1809, Sir Harford Jones signed a 
U||treaty with the Shah, by which Path Ali annulled all 
U||previous treaties he had entered into with European 
U||Powers, and undertook to prevent the passage of 
U||European armies through his dominions towards India, 
U||whilst we promised to support him with troops and 
U||subsidies, and to abstain from intervention, except as 
U||mediators, in any war between Persia and Afghanistan. 
U||This treaty, though endorsed by the Governor-General 
U||of India, Lord Minto, was not however ratified at home, 
U||and the wrangling between Calcutta and London over 
U||the powers of Sir John Malcolm and Sir Harford 
U||Jones, who were respectively ordered to hold the 
U||ground against each other, continued to bring both 
U||governments into ridicule at Teheran, until Sir Gore 
U||Ouseley arrived in 1812, with authority to supersede 
U||the two rival plenipotentiaries. Even then the “defini- 
U||tive ” Treaty, which Sir Gore Ouseley concluded upon 
U||arrival, was not approved in London, and it was 
U||only on November 25th, 1814, that a final treaty “for 
U||the adjustment of the terms of the definitive Treaty of 
U||1812” was duly signed, sealed, and delivered, declaring 
U||in the preamble that “these happy leaves are a nosegay 
U||plucked from the thornless garden of concord and tied 
U||by the hand of the plenipotentiaries of the two great 
U||States.” The most important modifications of the 
U||treaty of 1812 in the instrument which thus superseded 
U||It consisted in the withdrawal of the clauses under 
U||lyhich England had undertaken to assist Persia in the 
U||THE SIEGE OF HERAT 13 
U||establishment of a naval force and naval stations on the 
U||Caspian, and to supply officers and non-commissioned 
U||officers for the reorganisation of the Persian Army. In 
U||the event of an attack upon Persia by another power, 
U||England now also reserved for herself the option of 
U||paying an annual subsidy in lieu of military assistance. 
U||Fourteen years later, in 1828, when Persia was again 
U||involved in war with Russia, this obligation was com- 
U||muted into one single payment, at the price of which 
U||the articles of the treaty of 1814 binding us to give 
U||assistance to Persia were finally annulled. The French 
U||danger in Persia, which even in the days of Napoleon’s 
U||omnipotence was perhaps more visionary than real, 
U||had long since passed away, and the Russian danger 
U||was not yet. So we could, it was thought, afford to 
U||regard Persia as a quantite negligeable. 
U||Yet during the two following decades we had frequent 
U||opportunities of realising how seriously the loss of in- 
U||fluence we had incurred at Teheran by disappointing 
U||the expectations of the Persian Government could affect 
U||our interests beyond the frontiers of Persia. Russian 
U||diplomacy encouraged Path Ali Shah to seek once 
U||more in Afghanistan compensation for the cessions of 
U||territory he had been compelled to make to his northern 
U||neighbour. From 1837 to 1857 our relations with Persia 
U||were periodically strained by hostile movements of 
U||Persian troops, sometimes openly and always covertly 
U||supported by Russia, against Herat. The siege of 
U||Herat in 1837-8 by a Persian army under the Shah’s 
U||grandson has remained ever memorable for the gallant 
U||defence, organised mainly by the energy and ability of 
U||a single young British officer, Eldred Pottinger ; but it 
U||was not raised until a demonstration had been made in 
U||the Persian Gulf, where our troops occupied the island 
U||14 THE PERSIAN ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM 
U||of Kharak. Persia was, however, only temporarily over- 
U||awed. In 1851 she again attempted to interfere forcibly 
U||in the affairs of Herat, and in spite of a definite engage- 
U||ment to abstain from such intervention, which was 
U||signed at Teheran in January, 1853, the attitude of the 
U||Persian Court led to a complete rupture of diplomatic 
U||relations in the following year, and in 1855 another 
U||Persian expedition was despatched to Herat. Again 
U||the British Government was compelled to bring warlike 
U||pressure upon Persia, and when Herat was captured 
U||by the Persians in October, 1856, a force was sent 
U||under Sir James Outram to occupy Bushire and 
U||Muhammerah, at the head of the Persian Gulf. The 
U||campaign was short and almost bloodless, the Persian 
U||troops being routed at every point almost without a 
U||struggle ; and in spite of the vain-glorious rhodomon- 
U||tades of the Teheran Government, which kept on 
U||issuing grotesque bulletins of fabled victories, the Shah 
U||deemed it expedient to invoke the good offices of the 
U||emperor of the French, and on March 25th, 1857, a 
U||treaty of peace was signed in Paris, by which Persia 
U||relinquished all claims to sovereignty or to the right of 
U||interference in Afghanistan. This was, indeed, the only 
U||stipulation we imposed upon Persia. We exacted no 
U||guarantees for its fulfilment; we asked for no com- 
U||pensation or concessions beyond a ceremonial apology 
U||to our Minister, on his return to Teheran, for the 
U||insults to which he had been subjected before the out- 
U||break of hostilities ; we agreed to restore every bit of 
U||Persian territory we had occupied ; we claimed neither 
U||political nor commercial advantages. One knows not 
U||whether to admire more the generosity or the im- 
U||providence of such a treaty. It is now sometimes 
U||suggested that there must have been some connexion 
U||THE ANGLO-PERSIAN TREATY OF 1857 t$ 
U||between the impending outbreak of the Indian meeting 
U||and the hasty conclusion of peace with Persia, But a 
U||mere comparison of dates disposes once for all of that 
U||fiction. The treaty was negotiated in Paris in March, 
U||1857, and neither at home nor in India had the official 
U||ear caught at that time even the faintest mutterings of 
U||the storm which was to break over India two months 
U||later. The true explanation is that the importance of 
U||Persia as a factor in the Asiatic problem, which had 
U||been momentarily realised under the pressure of the 
U||Napoleonic danger at the beginning of the last century, 
U||had then been once more entirely lost sight of. 
U||The Crimean war had just been fought, and the 
U||Eastern question, as the Asiatic problem was then 
U||called, centred at that time in Constantinople. It 
U||was held to have been settled under the walls of 
U||Sebastopol. The remoteness of Persia, the pressure 
U||we could always exercise upon her as the masters of 
U||India, and her vulnerability in the Persian Gulf com- 
U||bined to relegate her to a subsidiary position on the 
U||political chessboard. Russia, no doubt, had been for 
U||a long time pressirfg heavily upon Persia from the 
U||Caucasus, indeed ever since the days when Peter the 
U||Great made his descent upon the southern shores of 
U||the Caspian, and the Treaties of Gulistan in 1813 and 
U||of Turkman Tchai in 1828 had already demonstrated 
U||the powerlessness of Persia to arrest the southward 
U||progress of her northern neighbour to the west of the 
U||Caspian. But Russia’s conquests appeared to consti- 
U||tute merely a not unnatural extension of her European 
U||Empire, and she hardly claimed at that time to be a 
U||great Power in Asia, notwithstanding the vast extent of 
U||territory over which she held sway in the north. Though 
U||the diplomatic records of Teheran contained ample 
U||i6 THE PERSIAN ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM 
U||evidence of the subserviency which the Persian Govern- 
U||ment had already not infrequently been compelled to 
U||show to R-ussia at the expense of its good relations with 
U||Great Britain, it was not until the tide of Russian con- 
U||quest swept over Central Asia in the latter part of the 
U||last century that Russia was able to challenge perma- 
U||nently in the Persian capital the position we had 
U||hitherto occupied as the greatest European Power in 
U||Asia. The military occupation of the Trans-Caspian 
U||regions and the annexation of the Khanates and of 
U||Merv gave Russia a frontier, marching for over five 
U||hundred miles with that of Persia to the east of the 
U||Caspian, and the construction of the Central Asian 
U||Railway from Khrasnovodsk secured her a strategic 
U||position which entirely envelops the province of 
U||Khorasan, and places it and Mazanderan as completely 
U||at the mercy of a Russian army as were already the 
U||Western provinces of Ghilan and Azerbaijan. 
U||Even then the results of this great change did not 
U||make themselves thoroughly felt in Persia until the 
U||sudden collapse of the Chinese Empire under the 
U||impact of Japan produced a fresh development of 
U||the Asiatic problem, pregnant with even more 
U||momentous issues. That Russia was not satisfied 
U||with the position she had gained in Central Asia, but 
U||was determined to make her power equally felt in 
U||Eastern Asia, had been evident from the moment when 
U||in 1891 she embarked upon so costly and formidable an 
U||enterprise as the construction of a great trunk railway 
U||connecting her European Empire through the whole 
U||length of Siberia with her remote possessions on the 
U||Pacific. The events of 1894-5 East took 
U||Russia, as they took the rest of the world, by surprise, 
U||long before the Siberian Railway could be completed. 
U||RUSSIAN POLICY IN PERSIA 
U||17 
U||But it was already sufficiently advanced to serve her as 
U||a weapon, offensive as well as defensive, in the conflict 
U||of international ambitions to which the inheritance of 
U||the ‘‘yellow corpse,” perhaps somewhat prematurely, 
U||gave rise. Indeed, if one looks back upon the events 
U||of the last eight years in China, it is difficult to conceive 
U||how Russia could have played the part she has played 
U||with such boldness and success in the Far East had she 
U||not been in a position to use the Siberian Railway both 
U||as an excuse for pegging out her claims and as an 
U||instrument for ultimately enforcing them. 
U||Thus in the brief course of some forty years — say 
U||between i860 and 1900 — the area of that Eastern ques- 
U||tion, which only a generation ago appeared confined 
U||mainly to the southern and eastern shores of the 
U||Mediterranean and the Black Sea, has been extended, 
U||not only across the Caspian to the plains of Central 
U||Asia, but to the far-away coast of the Pacific, and the 
U||problem has assumed a magnitude and a complexity 
U||which may well strain the powers of even the highest 
U||statesmanship. Before entering upon a discussion 
U||of the immediate objects of Russian policy at Teheran 
U||and the methods it employs, it is therefore necessary to 
U||emphasise the point that the importance and signifi- 
U||cance of Russia’s action in Persia cannot be measured 
U||merely by the international interests which it affects 
U||locally, though these should not be underrated. The 
U||policy of Russia in Persia is only part of a great 
U||system of Asiatic policy — commercial, military, and 
U||political — which is being steadily built up by the per- 
U||severing hands of Russian statesmen, whose breadth 
U||of grasp and continuity of purpose are liable to no 
U||disturbance from the fluctuations of public sentiment or 
U||the precariousness of parliamentary majorities. To 
U||c 
U||i8 THE PERSIAN ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM 
U||them Teheran is merely one link in a long chain which 
U||stretches from Constantinople to Peking, and the pres- 
U||sure they apply in Persia is perhaps not infrequently 
U||meant to be felt as much in the Far East or in the Near 
U||East as in the Middle East. That policy may or may 
U||not be incompatible with the interests of the British 
U||Empire — ^an empire whose fortunes can hardly be dis- 
U||severed from those of its great Indian dependency — but 
U||it cannot fail to affect them very considerably. In a 
U||minor or varying degree it must also affect the interests 
U||of other powers who have, or hope to acquire, a stake 
U||in Asia, but none of these are at present comparable 
U||with our own. Not many years ago the Persian question 
U||was perhaps not unnaturally regarded as a separate 
U||issue to be dealt with on its own merits. To-day it 
U||requires no exceptionally far-sighted statesmanship 
U||to see that it is merely part of the larger question, 
U||upon the solution of which the future of Asia must 
U||depend. That question is whether Asia is really a field 
U||in which there is room for two of the greatest European 
U||Powers, which are also the two greatest Asiatic Powers, 
U||to fulfil their peaceful mission in friendly competition, 
U||or whether their rivalry must ultimately degenerate into 
U||a struggle for exclusive mastery. The special interest 
U||which attaches to the Persian branch of that question 
U||is that, whereas in other regions of Asia new factors 
U||are introduced into the problem by the aspirations 
U||of other powers that claim for themselves also a place 
U||in the Asiatic sunshine, Great Britain and Russia still 
U||stand alone and almost face to face in Persia, in the 
U||presence of a sick-bed more desperate perhaps than 
U||that of any other Asiatic monarchy. 
U||THE MORNING START FROM A PERSIAN CARAVANSERAI 
U||CHAPTER III 
U||THROUGH ‘‘THE GATES OF THE CASPIAN** 
U||T he shortest and most convenient route for the 
U||traveller proceeding from Western Europe to the 
U||Persian capital is by rail through Russia to Baku and 
U||thence by steamer across the Caspian to Enzeli and 
U||Resht. He will find it also in many ways the most 
U||instructive, for it will afford him an opportunity of 
U||noting the energy and enterprise with which Russia 
U||has not only developed her means of communication in 
U||that direction, but has practically secured to herself the 
U||monopoly of access to N orthern Persia. Less than twenty 
U||years ago, when I was first in Persia, the main railway 
U||system of Russia was entirely cut off from the line, 
U||which had then only been quite recently completed 
U||between Datum and Baku, by the great mountain range 
U||of the Caucasus, across which there was only the old 
U||military road from Vladikavkas to Tiflis over the Dariel 
U||Pass. Russia still considered herself bound by Article 59 
U||of the Treaty of Berlin, under which she had under- 
U||taken to make Batum, which had been ceded to her 
U||under that instrument by Turkey, ‘‘a free port essen- 
U||tially commercial,'’ and, by way of Batum, goods for 
U||Persia and Central Asia could still be imported from 
U||Europe under a transit pass which exempted them from 
U||the payment of Russian import duties. At that time, 
U||19 
U||20 THROUGH “THE GATES OF THE CASPIAN” 
U||both for freight and passengers, the most commodious 
U||route to Northern Persia was therefore unquestionably 
U||by Constantinople and the Black Sea to Batum and 
U||thence by rail, ma Tiflis, to Baku. This has long 
U||since ceased. By a mere stroke of the pen Russia 
U||freed herself, in spite of Lord Rosebery’s cogent and 
U||logically irrefutable protest, from the obligations she 
U||had contracted at Berlin. Not only has Batum ceased 
U||to be a free port, essentially commercial, but the exac- 
U||tion of Russian import and export duties on all goods 
U||sent through Batum for Persia or beyond has long 
U||since killed the old transit trade. On the other hand, 
U||the Russian railway system, which has been vigorously 
U||developed throughout Southern Russia, has been linked 
U||up with Baku and the lines south of the Caucasus to 
U||Batum and Kars by a line that runs along the northern 
U||spurs of the mountain range and the coast of the 
U||Caspian from Rostoff, on the Don, direct to Baku. 
U||Besides the ordinary daily service, which is very com- 
U||fortable but very slow, a weekly train de luxe^ known 
U||as the “Petroleum Express,” conveys the traveller in 
U||sixty-two hours from Moscow to the great oil city on 
U||the Caspian at an average speed of twenty-seven miles 
U||an hour, which, though from our point of view not 
U||excessive, is in the circumstances as much as can be 
U||reasonably expected. There is another and even more 
U||expeditious route from Central Europe, via Vienna, 
U||Lemberg, Ekaterinoslaw, and Voroshisk, to Rostoff on 
U||the Don and Baku, but it has the disadvantage of 
U||more numerous changes. It is, however, the route 
U||used for the mails, and whereas twenty years ago three 
U||weeks was the minimum for the transmission of letters 
U||between London and Teheran, the mail from Teheran 
U||is now often delivered in London, or vice versa, on the 
U||MOSCOW AND PEKING 
U||21 
U||twelfth day after despatch, and generally within the 
U||fortnight. 
U||From another point of view Baku may be regarded 
U||also as the most instructive as well as the most con- 
U||venient point of departure for the traveller passing out 
U||of Europe into Persia. As if to accentuate the contrast 
U||which the spectacle of an ancient Asiatic monarchy in 
U||the last stage of decay is about to present to him, Baku 
U||offers him the spectacle of a young and progressive city 
U||in which the spirit of Western enterprise is far more 
U||conspicuous than, perhaps, in any other Russian city. 
U||Distinguished Russian writers like Prince Ukhtomsky, 
U||who claim for Russia a special mission in Asia, are 
U||fond of urging that in a certain affinity of race and 
U||temperament the Russian possesses peculiar qualifica- 
U||tions for dealing with Asiatics which are denied to the 
U||Western European, and not least to the Englishman. 
U||There is no doubt much truth in this contention. The 
U||most superficial observer who passes into Russia from 
U||Germany or Austria can hardly help feeling that, what- 
U||ever the geographical text-books may say, when he has 
U||once crossed the Russian frontier he is no longer quite 
U||in Europe, though he is not yet actually in Asia. The 
U||comparison may seem paradoxical, but to anyone who 
U||has visited Northern China, Moscow itself, with its 
U||semi-sacred Kremlin, in which the barbaric splendour 
U||of palaces and churches, stiff with gold and precious 
U||stones, has been accumulated for centuries to glorify 
U||the mystical association of spiritual and temporal 
U||sovereignty in the person of the Tsar, carries more 
U||than a suggestion of Peking and its Forbidden City, 
U||sacred to the Son of Heaven. Even to the outward eye 
U||the view from the tower of Ivan Veliky over the 
U||thousands of cupolas and domes, gleaming with gold 
U||22 
U||THROUGH “THE GATES OF THE CASPIAN” 
U||plates or painted in vivid tints of green and blue, and 
U||the green or brown roofs of the Russian houses, inter- 
U||mingled with trees and gardens, which mark the pano- 
U||rama of Moscow, has no little in common with the 
U||spectacle which the yellow-tiled palaces and temples 
U||of Imperial Peking and the green or grey roofs of the 
U||Manchu and Chinese cities in a similar setting of foliage 
U||present from the walls of the Celestial capital. Just as 
U||there is no distinct line of demarcation drawn by nature 
U||between the Russian Empire in Europe and in Asia, 
U||and the Steppes of the Don and the Volga merge 
U||imperceptibly into the ’plains of Central Asia, so 
U||the Russian character seems to have passed through 
U||a series of subtle gradations from the Asiatic type 
U||out of which it was originally evolved into a type 
U||which can no longer be called Asiatic, but which 
U||should certainly not be labelled as European. In the 
U||history of nations there has been perhaps no more 
U||curious phenomenon than the experiment upon which 
U||the rulers of modern Russia have embarked in their 
U||endeavour to blend with the fatalism and mysticism 
U||and passivity of the East the spirit of enterprise and 
U||individualism peculiar to the West. 
U||Whatever may be the case in other parts of Russia, 
U||in Baku, at any rate, the West has triumphed. Though 
U||long strings of camels may still be seen journeying 
U||towards its markets laden with the produce of Asia, 
U||though the Tartar city is still girdled with its ancient 
U||walls, though Persians and Turkomans in their quaint 
U||Oriental dresses still crowd its bazaars, Baku is essen- 
U||tially a European city in which the spirit of the West 
U||prevails. It is, in fact, more European than any other 
U||town in Russia, except, perhaps, St. Petersburg, 
U||Warsaw, or Odessa. It is not only that it possesses 
U||THE OILFIELDS OF BAKU 
U||23 
U||spacious streets, well - stocked shops, stately public 
U||buildings, and handsome private residences, as well as 
U||great commercial houses, and is in fact equipped with 
U||most of the modern appliances of a prosperous trading 
U||city. There is something in the air of the place which 
U||makes one feel that in Baku he is in what our American 
U||cousins would call ‘‘a live city.” Its extraordinarily 
U||rapid growth can indeed hardly be matched on this 
U||side of the Atlantic. When I passed through Baku 
U||in 1884 its population was about 60,000 or 70,000. 
U||To-day it is getting on for a quarter of a million. Its 
U||prosperity is, of course, entirely due to the great 
U||oilfields which surround it. In 1884 they yielded 
U||89.000. 000 puds (the pud = 36 lbs.) ; in 1901 they yielded 
U||671.000. 000 puds, or approximately 12,000,000 tons 
U||of naphtha, which produced for exportation about 
U||2,500,000 tons of kerosene and over 5,000,000 tons 
U||of residuals used for fuel on the greater part of the 
U||Eastern and Southern Russian railways, as well as on 
U||the Russian steamers on the Volga, on the Caspian, 
U||and on the Black Sea. A few years ago there was still 
U||a disposition to believe that the supply of oil must be 
U||limited, and that the increasing rapidity of production 
U||must lead to an early exhaustion of the fields. Nothing 
U||has happened to confirm that idea, and he would be 
U||a bold man who would attempt to set a limit either to 
U||the productivity or to the life of the Baku oilfields. 
U||Though from time to time individual wells are abandoned 
U||because they are exhausted or can no longer be worked 
U||at a profit, especially in view of the heavy royalties for 
U||which too sanguine speculators made themselves re- 
U||sponsible during the petroleum ‘‘boom” a few years 
U||ago, the number of producing wells has increased 
U||steadily from 458 in 1891 to 1,924 in 1901. There were 
U||24 THROUGH ‘^THE GATES OF THE CASPIAN” 
U||842 new wells in boring last year, and 31 1 old wells 
U||were being deepened, and at the present moment an 
U||important scheme is being carried out for draining an 
U||inland lake, which will lay bare an entirely new field 
U||reputed to be of exceptional wealth. Of the prodigious 
U||quantities of naphtha stored away in the bowels of the 
U||earth some idea may be gathered from the so-called 
U||‘^fountains” or springs of oil that frequently burst 
U||forth in the course of boring and, defying all restraint, 
U||shoot up into the air in jets over 200 feet high, which 
U||it takes days to bring under control. One of these 
U||‘‘fountains” caught fire on one occasion and burnt 
U||steadily for three weeks, giving away so much gas that 
U||for that period the streets of Baku twelve miles away 
U||required no other illuminants. Such accidents, dis- 
U||astrous as they are, the people of Baku mention, merely, 
U||and with no little pride, as illustrating what their wells 
U||can do, and they do not for a moment disturb their 
U||faith in the future of an industry which, apart from 
U||other developments, already supplies more than half 
U||the world with petroleum. There is probably much more 
U||danger at present of over-production than of any falling 
U||off in productivity. The grave economic crisis through 
U||which Russia has been and is still passing could not 
U||fail to affect Baku, and, combined with other causes, 
U||it has substantially depressed the price of naphtha 
U||products. During the boom of 1899 the price of crude 
U||oil rose to 167 kopeks per pud. In 1901 it fell to 5*45 
U||kopeks, and last year it had recovered only to just over 
U||8 kopeks per pud. But during the cholera visitations 
U||and famines of 1892-3 it fell to very much lower values, 
U||and no fluctuations, however severe, can, it is believed, 
U||permanently affect the prosperity of a city which con- 
U||trols and handles such inexhaustible sources of wealth , 
U||THE LAND OF THE LION AND THE SUN 25 
U||One important factor in the prosperity of Baku is the 
U||wide range of its trade, which extends from the British 
U||Islands in one direction to the Far East in the other. 
U||Hence, also, the cosmopolitan character of the city, 
U||where, in spite of the exclusive tendencies of Russian 
U||economic policy, British and German and French com- 
U||munities are tolerated and encouraged to play their 
U||respective parts in endowing this arid reach of the 
U||Caspian with the social amenities of Western life as 
U||well as with the material equipment of Western enter- 
U||prise, to the unquestionable benefit of the Russian 
U||State. 
U||I have dwelt at some length on the wonderful picture 
U||of successful human activity which Baku now presents, 
U||though only a hundred years ago it was a neglected 
U||outpost of the Persian Empire, which then stretched 
U||up to the Caucasus, because, as I said just now, it 
U||serves to heighten the contrast that awaits the Western 
U||traveller when he lands on Persian soil at Enzeli after a 
U||voyage of barely two hundred miles. He steps at Baku 
U||straight from the quay of a well-appointed harbour on 
U||to a small but fairly comfortable steamer, which, after 
U||calling for some hours at two intermediate points on 
U||the coast, drops anchor at an early hour on the second 
U||morning after departure from Baku opposite to a mud 
U||flat with a few low buildings over which the Persian 
U||flag displays the Lion and the Sun. That is Enzeli. 
U||The Caspian is so shallow along this shore that, 
U||though the steamer only draws about eight feet of 
U||water, she cannot, even in the most favourable circum- 
U||stances, approach within more than a mile of the royal 
U||port of Persia. In unfavourable circumstances — ^and 
U||the Caspian has ever been famous for the violence and 
U||suddenness of its storms — ^the steamer cannot even 
U||26 THROUGH ‘‘THE GATES OF THE CASPIAN’* 
U||attempt to cast anchor, and luckless passengers have 
U||been known to be carried three times from Baku to 
U||within sight of Enzeli and back without being able 
U||to land. In calm weather the traveller’s experiences 
U||between the steamer and his destination at Resht are 
U||instructive, and, according to his own idiosyncrasies, 
U||may seem either entertaining or merely wearisome. In 
U||rough weather they are apt to be painful and sometimes 
U||even dangerous. From the steamer he transfers him- 
U||self and his effects as best he can on board a small 
U||steam launch, which conveys him over the bar to the 
U||Customs station at Enzeli. The rains caught up from 
U||the north by the great mountain range which divides 
U||the main Persian plateau from the Caspian descend 
U||with almost tropical abundance upon the belt of low- 
U||lying land which extends from the foot of the hills to 
U||the seashore, and the streams thus formed flow lazily 
U||to the Caspian in tortuous channels broadening out 
U||here and there into great lagoons, which are separated 
U||from the sea only by narrow spits of land thrown up 
U||by the action of its tideless waves. Enzeli lies on the 
U||extremity of one of these spits. After passing through 
U||the Customs the traveller has to make his way again 
U||by water across the Ab-i-murd, or Dead Water, as the 
U||Persians aptly call the lagoon some six or seven miles 
U||in breadth which still lies between him and his destina- 
U||tion. The greater part of this can be done in a steam 
U||launch, but if you decide for the steam launch in 
U||preference to a native boat pulled by half a dozen lusty 
U||Ghilaks, you must have made arrangements beforehand 
U||for such a boat to meet you at the further end of the 
U||lagoon, for beyond a certain point there is not enough 
U||draught of water even for a steam launch, and you 
U||must, willy-nilly, transfer yourself again from the 
U||THE ROYAL ROAD INTO PERSIA 
U||27 
U||steam launch into a native craft which, after another 
U||hour of alternate rowing and towing and poling up a 
U||narrow creek, lands you at last in the shallow mud 
U||pond which is called Pireh-bazar, the harbour of Resht, 
U||still some six or seven miles by road from the city. 
U||The whole of this northern belt of Persia between 
U||the Caspian and the mountains is covered with dense 
U||vegetation, South European in its character, but almost 
U||tropical in its luxuriance ; and on a beautiful morning 
U||in the early autumn, such as that with which I was 
U||favoured towards the middle of September, 1902, it is 
U||pleasant enough to glide in a native boat across the 
U||placid waters of the lagoon, reflecting the cloudless 
U||azure of the sky, and up the winding creek between 
U||dense masses of jungle, with tier upon tier of blue 
U||mountains rising mistily in the far distance out of the 
U||heat haze of the moist lowlands. But what a contrast 
U||between the busy scenes, the strenuousness of modern 
U||life, one has left behind him only a few hours ago at 
U||Baku, and the old-world apathy and squalid shiftless- 
U||ness of this royal road into Persia — a. road conceived, 
U||it would seem, for the express purpose, not of removing, 
U||but of multiplying obstacles to traffic. For years past 
U||the Persian Government is supposed to have been 
U||studying schemes for cutting a channel through the 
U||bar and dredging a port at Enzeli, as well as for 
U||providing a better approach to Resht than that which 
U||Pireh-bazar affords. There are no serious difficulties 
U||in the way, the cost would not be excessive, and the 
U||outlay would certainly be remunerative. One might 
U||even imagine that the pride of the Persian rulers, who 
U||are by no means reluctant to copy the West in other 
U||and less useful matters, would be enlisted in support of 
U||some such scheme ; for after all, apart from all economic 
U||28 THROUGH ‘‘THE GATES OF THE CASPIAN” 
U||considerations of trade, it is by way of Enzeli and 
U||Resht that the mails between Europe and Persia are 
U||carried and the vast majority of European travellers 
U||approach the Persian capital. But year after year 
U||passes, precious millions are squandered in other direc- 
U||tions, and the royal road into Persia remains what it 
U||has been for generations, so that he who travels by it 
U||may at once leave at the gates of the Persian kingdom 
U||any illusions he may have brought with him as to the 
U||amenability of Persia to any other progressive in- 
U||fluences than those of compulsion. Between Enzeli 
U||and Resht he can see Persia as it is. 
U||CHAPTER IV 
U||THE ‘PRUSSIAN’’ ROAD TO TEHERAN 
U||I DESCRIBED in the last chapter those truly Asiatic 
U||stages of the royal road into Persia which give so 
U||much food for reflection to the Western traveller between 
U||leaving the Caspian steamer at Enzeli and finally land- 
U||ing on terra firma in the mud-pond harbour of Pireh- 
U||bazar. There he still finds himself some six or seven 
U||miles from the town of Resht. But, nevertheless, he 
U||feels himself once more almost in Europe, for he is once 
U||more on a fairly good carriage-road, and that road runs 
U||not merely into Resht, but thence for some 220 miles 
U||over difficult mountain ranges to the Persian capital. 
U||Needless to say, it is not a Persian road — that is to say, 
U||it is not a road built by Persians. It is a Russian 
U||road, built largely with Russian capital and wholly by 
U||Russian enterprise, and it constitutes the first, and to 
U||the traveller of whatever nationality a by no means 
U||unwelcome, manifestation of the ascendency which 
U||Russia has gained in Northern Persia. Controlled 
U||though it be ostensibly by a private company, it is no 
U||secret that the road from Resht to Teheran would never 
U||have been constructed and could not be maintained 
U||without generous assistance from the Russian State. 
U||Persia has not contributed a penny towards it, though 
U||a few Persians are understood to hold shares in the 
U||29 
U||30 THE “RUSSIAN” ROAD TO TEHERAN 
U||company, just as a few Chinese are supposed /ro forma 
U||to hold shares in the Manchurian Railway. The outlay 
U||has been enormous, for, in spite of the undeniable 
U||difficulties of construction — the road rises to an altitude 
U||of over 7,000 feet in crossing the mountain range — the 
U||cost, which is estimated at ;^30o,ooo, must be pro- 
U||nounced excessive. It is, as I have said, about 220 miles 
U||long, and of these 220 miles some 90 miles on the level 
U||plain between Kazvin and Teheran had already been 
U||made, at least in a rudimentary fashion, by a Persian 
U||company, which was bought up by the Russians. The 
U||cost of improving that section of the road must have 
U||been relatively trifling, and the bulk of the total outlay 
U||must therefore be assigned to the section between Resht 
U||and Kazvin, which does not exceed 130 miles in length. 
U||This represents an average of over a mile, and, 
U||though the road is fairly well built and the engineering 
U||difficulties encountered in climbing the steep slopes — at 
U||first so beautifully wooded and then so barren and 
U||precipitous — to the north of the range, and in threading 
U||a way through the gaunt and narrow gorges of sun- 
U||scorched rock which lead down on to the great plateau 
U||of Northern Persia, must have been very considerable, 
U||so heavy an expenditure can be accounted for only by 
U||the lavish extravagance and absence of all financial 
U||control which generally characterise Russian under- 
U||takings of this nature. This, however, is an aspect 
U||of the question upon which it would be ungrateful to 
U||dwell, and, for my part, I was much more disposed 
U||to regret that the Russians had not undertaken the 
U||exploitation as well as the construction of the road, 
U||instead of sub-letting the former to Persian contractors, 
U||who ran antediluvian carriages with wretchedly over- 
U||worked and under-fed horses. The contractors, it is 
U||A DEFENCELESS FRONTIER 31 
U||true, complained that, in spite of the heavy rates they 
U||charged, they are running the road at a loss, and 
U||I was assured that the Russians intended before long 
U||to relieve them of their contract and work the road 
U||themselves with an exclusively Russian staff. 
U||Whether the result of the undertaking be financially 
U||successful or the reverse, we may be sure that the 
U||Russians have not been throwing their money away. 
U||What their objects are is sufficiently obvious. There 
U||is no reason to suppose that they have ever contem- 
U||plated using this road for strategic purposes. The 
U||difficulties of approach from the sea are sufficient to 
U||dispose of any such idea. Moreover, as I shall show 
U||later on, from the strategic point of view, the north 
U||of Persia lies absolutely open to Russia in so many 
U||other directions that she might well have left the 
U||Resht road to take care of itself. Even without the 
U||road from Erivan to Tabriz, in North-Western Persia, 
U||for which the Russians have obtained a concession, 
U||they can at any moment pour their troops as easily 
U||from Transcaucasia into Azerbaijan as they can along 
U||the coast of the Caspian from Baku and Lenkoran 
U||into the province of Gilan. A few years ago, when 
U||there were troubles at Astrabad, to the south-east of 
U||the Caspian, the Russians gave Persia a foretaste 
U||of what they could do in Mazenderan by despatching 
U||a few hundred men from Chikishliar, who remained for 
U||some months in occupation of the provincial capital. 
U||Further east, again, the Trans-Caspian or Central Asian 
U||Railway runs for some hundreds of miles close along the 
U||northern frontier of Persia, and dominates the whole 
U||of Khorasan, in the absence of any Persian force which 
U||can be dignified with the name of an army. It is 
U||therefore quite unnecessary to suggest strategic reasons 
U||32 THE ‘‘RUSSIAN” ROAD TO TEHERAN 
U||for the construction of the Resht road to Teheran, 
U||But Russia, none the less, gets value for her money. 
U||Not only does the road serve the ends of Russian 
U||commercial policy, which is almost openly directed to 
U||the acquisition of an absolute monopoly in the trade 
U||of Northern Persia, but it is in itself a splendid and 
U||perfectly legitimate advertisement of Russian influence. 
U||Russian occupies the place of honour in every document 
U||drawn up in connection with transportation on the road. 
U||The names of all the stations figure conspicuously in 
U||Russian characters. The barriers at which the Russian 
U||company levies its tolls are in the hands of Russian 
U||officials. The Russians have the maintenance of the 
U||road, and all the gangs employed on repairs are under 
U||the orders of Russian overseers. Not only, therefore, 
U||is every Persian travelling along the main road from 
U||the north to the capital made to feel that the Russians 
U||hold the right of access to it, but the inhabitants of all 
U||the adjoining districts, who provide the requisite labour, 
U||are taught to look up to the Russians as their employers 
U||and their masters. But though the advantages which 
U||Russia thus reaps from this undertaking deserve to be 
U||noted, it would be unfair as well as futile to cavil at 
U||them. The whole position which Russia has acquired 
U||in the north of Persia deserves, I think, to be studied 
U||in a spirit, not of idle recrimination, but of dis- 
U||passionate, and even friendly, consideration. 
U||Whilst the road from Resht to Teheran affords a 
U||perfect illustration of Russian activity, it happened to 
U||afford, whilst I was passing over it, an accidental, but 
U||equally striking, illustration of Persian mediaevalism. 
U||The Shah was on his way back from Europe, and 
U||in accordance with immemorial custom, the whole of 
U||his Court, numbering thousands of retainers, was 
U||AN OLD-WORLD PROCESSION 
U||33 
U||hurrying down to welcome him at the frontier. It 
U||was the strangest and most picturesque spectacle which 
U||the eye of an artist enamoured of quaint contrasts, 
U||or of a student in search of a typical presentment 
U||of the unchanging East, could hope to light upon. 
U||For hours at a time there streamed past us a cease- 
U||less procession of camels, mules, horses, carts and 
U||litters, laden with the personnel and the paraphernalia 
U||of an Eastern Court, which, though it has to some 
U||slight extent adopted a travesty of European fashions, 
U||and has lost from other causes much of its ancient 
U||splendour, is still in most respects as barbaric as when 
U||Tavernier’s travels excited the wonder of the French 
U||people, accustomed to the magnificence of the Roi 
U||SoleiL An advanced guard of Persian Cossacks — 
U||a squadron of the brigade of Persian ‘^Cossack” 
U||cavalry which, drilled and officered by Russians, alone 
U||stands for efficiency in the Persian Army — opened the 
U||march with some show of ordered pomp. At some 
U||distance behind them came a regiment of Persian 
U||infantry, slouching along the road in every variety 
U||of patched or tattered uniform — once upon a time sky 
U||blue — some with two shoes of different patterns, many 
U||with only one, and most of them with none, the 
U||majority old men or mere boys, with a sprinkling of 
U||every other age, from extreme youth to extreme senility. 
U||Their rifles, marked by the same variety of pattern and 
U||condition, came afterwards, stuck promiscuously on to 
U||the pack of any unobjecting mule. Those who had 
U||fallen out hopelessly on the way, or had a few coppers 
U||to spare — or were they, perhaps, the officers ? — we met 
U||later on, reclining in picturesque confusion on the top 
U||of cumbrous baggage carts. A military band was 
U||conveyed in an even more original fashion, each of the 
U||D 
U||34 the “RUSSIAN” ROAD TO TEHERAN 
U||larger instruments — big drums, trombones, horns, etc. 
U||— crowning in solitary grandeur the load of a pack 
U||camel. What the endless strings of beasts of burden 
U||carried in the huge wooden chests and packages of 
U||every shape and size under which they slithered down 
U||the steep mountain slopes, one could only guess at when 
U||some mishap necessitated the repacking of a load in 
U||the middle of the road. Then one might get a glimpse 
U||of costly carpets and tent walls of many colours, of 
U||robes of honour and silken embroideries, of quilted 
U||bedding and cushions of soft texture. Here and there 
U||a silver ewer, or a piece of gaudy French furniture, 
U||which had been overlooked until the last moment, or 
U||had proved recalcitrant to Persian packing, was tied 
U||on loosely with a bit of string, and kept clanking on 
U||the side of the load as the unconscious mule disported 
U||himself along the road. 
U||On brightly caparisoned horses officers of the house- 
U||hold, with their silver staves of office stuck jauntily 
U||under the thigh, and a leather peak adjusted to their 
U||black lambswool cap at the proper angle to shield their 
U||eyes from the sun — a very practical adjustment, which, 
U||however, imparts to the wearer a curiously rakish air — 
U||Court attendants of various ranks — many of them, no 
U||doubt, generals of the first or second class, a rank which 
U||is liberally conferred in Persia for services entirely un- 
U||connected with the art of war — flunkeys in scarlet coats, 
U||with faded bravery of gold and silver lace, high officials 
U||of State in full-waisted black broadcloth coats of semi- 
U||European design, mullahs in green or white turbans, of 
U||different degrees of sanctity and learning, notabilities 
U||of the countryside from far and near, and hundreds of 
U||menials and camp followers of every description, real 
U||‘‘beggars on horseback,” jostled each other in be- 
U||THE “RUSSIAN” ROAD FROM RESHT TO TEHERAN 
U||THE GLORY AND THE HAVOC OF THE EAST 35 
U||wildering confusion along the road, or sat in groups at 
U||the wayside resthouses, discussing the latest gossip 
U||over their waterpipes and tea. In hooded Russian 
U||carts drawn by four horses abreast, or in wooden 
U||panniers slung on either side of a camel, Persian ladies 
U||of high and low degree — their faces and their figures 
U||alike shrouded beyond any recognition in the ample 
U||black domino and thick white linen veil which all 
U||invariably wear out of doors — were following in the 
U||wake of their lords and masters. Further on, close to 
U||Teheran, we came across two huge camps in which the 
U||Shah’s harem or anderoouy to use the Persian equivalent, 
U||which had been suddenly commanded by telegraph 
U||from Europe to wait upon his Majesty at the frontier, 
U||were resting after a night’s march, during the heat of 
U||the day, in charge of Court officials and black eunuchs. 
U||At intervals the road was cleared for the passage of 
U||some Prince of the Blood or great officer of State, 
U||travelling down in an ancient brougham or calech^y 
U||with four or six horses a la JDaumont and seedy postil- 
U||lions, followed by an uncouth retinue of pipe-bearers 
U||and ferrashes on horseback. 
U||It was a wonderful succession of tableaux vivants^ 
U||embodying the whole story of what ‘^Eothen” terms 
U||the glory and the havoc of the East — more especially 
U||the havoc; If only one could have recorded the scene 
U||on a cinematograph for production at the Hippodrome, 
U||where the Shah had himself been seen but a few weeks 
U||before surrounded by the well-ordered pomp of the 
U||West, it would have helped not only the British 
U||public, but even responsible statesmen at home, to form 
U||some conception of men and things as they really are 
U||in Persia. Just imagine what a reckless waste of time 
U||and money this motley pilgrimage means ! For a 
U||36 THE “RUSSIAN” ROAD TO TEHERAN 
U||month at least the whole business of the State, such as 
U||it is, is at a standstill. The Shah was, of course, stated 
U||to have given emphatic orders, immediately upon his 
U||accession, that the Court was not to prey upon the 
U||country through which it moved, and that everything 
U||was to be paid for at full value. But how is the Shah 
U||to know whether his orders are carried out ? Of course 
U||they are not carried out, and no swarm of locusts lays 
U||a countryside more bare than this ceremonial army on 
U||the march. As for the drain on the Shah’s exchequer, 
U||it is impossible to form any trustworthy estimate, but I 
U||was assured that the mere cost of moving the royal 
U||anderoon from Teheran to Resht amounted to 30,000 
U||tomans, or about £6^000. The total expenditure 
U||probably did not fall far short of £40^000 or ;^5o,ooo, 
U||and this in a country reduced to the utmost financial 
U||straits, of which the total public revenue for all pur- 
U||poses is not believed to exceed one and a half million 
U||sterling per annum. But it is an ancient custom, and, 
U||if it is a plague to the people of the country and a heavy 
U||drain upon the exchequer, it is a source of splendid 
U||profit to many powerful individuals, whose vested 
U||interests even the Shah must think twice before he 
U||touches. The East cannot, and should not, be judged 
U||by the standards of the West. But in this procession 
U||of a moribund past, with its strange mixture of magnifi- 
U||cence and squalor, passing unconcernedly down the 
U||‘‘ Russian ” road to the Persian capital, the most casual 
U||of Western observers could hardly fail to find a vivid 
U||reminder of the fateful writing on the wall, translated 
U||on this occasion into Russian characters. 
U||CHAPTER V 
U||RUSSIAN ASCENDENCY IN TEHERAN : THE 
U||POWER OF THE SWORD 
U||P ETER the Great’s celebrated will is doubtless an 
U||apocryphal document, but it can nevertheless 
U||hardly be denied that in it are to be found the germs 
U||of the Asiatic policy which his successors on the 
U||Russian throne have more or less deliberately pursued 
U||down to the present day. It was Peter the Great who 
U||gave the first impulse to Russian ambitions in the 
U||direction of Persia. In 1715 he despatched to the 
U||Persian Court at Isfahan under Colonel Walinsky the 
U||first of those semi-military missions with undefined 
U||and elastic powers which have played since then so 
U||large a part in the Asiatic diplomacy of Russia. 
U||Within eight years from that date Peter himself had 
U||advanced as far as Derbend on the Caspian at the head 
U||of a Russian army, and wrested from the feeble young 
U||Shah Tahmasp 11 . , in return for illusory promises of 
U||assistance against the Afghans, a treaty ceding to 
U||Russia the whole of the Persian littoral provinces of 
U||the Caspian. The bargain was, however, never carried 
U||out, and on the death of Peter in 1725, Nadir Kuli 
U||Khan, whose fame as Nadir Shah was soon to spread 
U||throughout Asia, had little difficulty in re-establishing 
U||Persian authority in the provinces which his master 
U||37 
U||38 RUSSIAN ASCENDENCY IN TEHERAN 
U||had so lightly abandoned, and by the Treaty of Resht 
U||in 1732, and by that of Gandja in 1735, Russia formally 
U||restored them to Persia, and for fifty years made no 
U||further move. But Catherine II. began to take an in- 
U||telligent interest in the fate of all the Christian popula- 
U||tions subjected to the yoke of her Mussulman neighbours, 
U||and in 1783 she agreed to extend her protection to the 
U||Georgians of the Caucasus. She did not, it is true, 
U||save them from the wrath of Agha Muhammed, the 
U||founder of the present Persian dynasty, who, accord- 
U||ing to a Persian historian, “gave to the Georgian 
U||unbelievers a specimen of what they were to expect 
U||on the Day of Judgment.” But in 1796 she sent 
U||an expedition to avenge them. Her death and the 
U||accession of Paul I. alone saved Teheran, to which 
U||the Kajar ruler of Persia had only recently transferred 
U||the capital, from actual occupation by a Russian army. 
U||Alexander I. promptly resumed the task which his 
U||predecessor had abandoned. The Treaty of Gulistan 
U||in October, 1813, merely arrested for a few years the 
U||tide of Russian conquest which had already perma- 
U||nently severed from Persia the provinces of Georgia, 
U||Mingrelia, Daghestan, Shirwan, Karabagh, and Talish. 
U||Constant disputes rose over the new boundaries, and 
U||in 1826 hostilities broke out afresh with disastrous 
U||results to Persia. By the Treaty of Turkman Chai 
U||of February 28th, 1828, she finally ceded to Russia the 
U||provinces of Erivan and Nakshivan in addition to those 
U||which had already been wrested from her. Within some 
U||thirty years Persia had been driven right out of the 
U||Caucasus to the south bank of the Araxes, and off the 
U||western shores of the Caspian as far as Astera. The 
U||frontier between Russia and Persia to the west of the 
U||Caspian, as laid down in the Treaty of Turkman Chai, 
U||THE RUSSIAN FORCES ON THE FRONTIER 39 
U||has remained up to the present day unaltered. But to 
U||the east of the Caspian the steady absorption by Russia 
U||of the ‘‘no man’s land,” which formerly covered the 
U||northern and north-eastern frontiers of Persia, has led 
U||to various readjustments of boundaries, always, of 
U||course, for the benefit of Russia. In 1838 the island 
U||of Ashurada, off the Bay of Astrabad in the Caspian, 
U||was occupied by the Russians. In 1869 the Russians 
U||having established a military station at Khrasnovodsk 
U||on the eastern shores of the Caspian, an agreement was 
U||drawn up fixing the River Attrek as the frontier of 
U||Persia and Russia for some thirty miles from its mouth, 
U||and this was supplemented in 1881 by a formal con- 
U||vention defining the whole boundary of the two countries 
U||east of the Caspian. 
U||From Mount Ararat in the west to the Heri Rud 
U||River in the east Persia is dominated by the over- 
U||whelming military forces of the Russian Empire. On 
U||either side of the Caspian Russian troops could be 
U||poured at any moment across her land frontiers, from 
U||the borders of Turkey to those of Afghanistan. Between 
U||the Black Sea and the Caspian Russia has her Corps 
U||d^Armee of the Caucasus. Its strength on a peace 
U||footing amounts altogether to 52,000 men, whereof 
U||38,000 infantry, 2,800 cavalry, and 5,000 artillery with 
U||156 guns, or altogether 46,000 men, are in fixed garri- 
U||sons, whilst six battalions of infantry, three regiments 
U||of Cossacks, and four Cossack batteries with twenty- 
U||eight guns, altogether 6,000 men of all arms, are 
U||quartered in outlying stations and camps away from 
U||the fixed garrisons. To this force must be added, for 
U||war purposes, the 63rd, 64th, 65th, and 66th Divisions 
U||of the Reserve and local levies. The Corps d^Armee of 
U||the Caucasus is divided into two corps. The head- 
U||40 
U||RUSSIAN ASCENDENCY IN TEHERAN 
U||quarters of the ist Corps are at Alexandropol, where 
U||the 39th Division of Infantry with its brigade of 
U||artillery is permanently stationed, whilst its Cossack 
U||cavalry is thrown forward to Erivan. Alexandropol is 
U||138 miles distant from and south of Tiflis, where are 
U||the headquarters of the 2nd Caucasus Corps. It is 
U||only forty-eight miles from Alexandropol to Erivan, in 
U||close proximity to the Persian frontier, whilst the great 
U||fortress of Kars lies about forty miles west. The 
U||Trans-Caucasian Railway from Tiflis, a purely strategic 
U||railway, has been constructed through very difficult 
U||and mountainous country to Alexandropol, with a 
U||branch line to Kars, and on to Erivan in the direction 
U||of the Persian frontier. It is now being rapidly ex- 
U||tended from Erivan towards the Araxes, and from its 
U||terminus at Julfa on the frontier it will be an easy 
U||march of only eighty miles along the carriage-road, for 
U||which the Russians have secui-ed the concession from 
U||the Persian Government, into Tabriz, the capital of 
U||Azerbaijan, and the most important city in North- 
U||Western Persia, where the Veli Ahd, or Heir Apparent 
U||to the Persian throne, now holds his court, as did his 
U||father, the present Shah, until his accession. East of 
U||Azerbaijan stretches the province of Ghilan, along the 
U||south-west shores of the Caspian. In this direction 
U||again the Russians have carried out surveys for a rail- 
U||way from Baku southwards along the coast through 
U||Lenkoran to the Persian frontier at Astera, which will 
U||give them direct access into Ghilan. The project has 
U||been for the present dropped or postponed, but it will 
U||certainly be put sooner or later into execution. 
U||The Caspian itself is a Russian lake in the fullest 
U||sense of the term, and would doubtless in any case have 
U||been so, even if Persia had not been compelled as far 
U||THE CASPIAN A RUSSIAN LAKE 
U||41 
U||back as the Treaty of Turkman Chai in 1828 to sub- 
U||scribe to an engagement, under which she is debarred 
U||from flying her flag on its waters. The monopoly 
U||which Russia thus obtained for her ships of war was 
U||further secured for her merchant flag by a decree of the 
U||Imperial Council of State at St. Petersburg issued 
U||November 24th, 1869, prohibiting the establishment of 
U||companies for the navigation of the Caspian by any 
U||but Russian subjects and the purchase of any shares in 
U||such companies by foreigners. To-day, in addition to 
U||a small flotilla of despatch vessels and gunboats, there 
U||is in the Caspian a considerable fleet of mail and 
U||merchant steamers under the Russian flag, many of 
U||them with a large carrying capacity, employed in the 
U||Baku petroleum trade, which would be available at any 
U||moment for the transport of troops. The island of 
U||Ashurada, in the south-east corner of the Caspian, 
U||just off the coast of Mazenderan, is occupied by the 
U||Russians as a naval station. 
U||East of the Caspian the Russian forces along the 
U||Persian frontier form part of the Turkestan Corps 
U||d'Armee of a peace strength of 22,000 men with thirty- 
U||eight guns. Of the two corps into which the Turkestan 
U||Corps d^Armee is divided, the ist has its headquarters 
U||at Tashkend, and may be regarded mainly as a Central 
U||Asian police force. The 2nd Corps has its head- 
U||quarters at Ashkabad, the military and administrative 
U||capital of Trans-Caspia, and the greater part of it is 
U||distributed along the Trans-Caspian Railway, which 
U||skirts the Persian frontier more or less closely for some 
U||200 miles. As far as I have been able to ascertain, it 
U||consists, on a peace footing, of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th 
U||brigades of Turkestan Rifles, two brigades of Trans- 
U||Caspian Cossacks, two railway battalions, four batteries 
U||42 
U||RUSSIAN ASCENDENCY IN TEHERAN 
U||of horse and field artillery, and one mountain battery, 
U||the whole distributed apparently in about equal pro- 
U||portions between fixed garrisons and outlying camps 
U||and stations. Its most advanced post on the Caspian 
U||is at Chikishliar, whence a few years ago, when disturb- 
U||ances occurred at Ashkabad, the capital of Mazenderan, 
U||in connection with quarantine measures, a Russian 
U||force was despatched to protect the Russian Consulate. 
U||It marched into Ashkabad within three days, and re- 
U||mained four months in possession, just to drive home 
U||the lesson. Further east the great province of Khor- 
U||asan lies equally at Russia’s mercy. From Ashkabad, 
U||which is only twenty miles distant from the Persian 
U||frontier, a carriage-road, for which the Russians, of 
U||course, hold a concession, opens up an easy route 
U||through Kuchan to Meshed, the capital and holy city 
U||of Khorasan, which the Russians moreover now 
U||equally dominate from the east along the valley of the 
U||Heri Rud. 
U||Whilst with all the resources of a great military 
U||empire behind it, and linked up with its base by a 
U||great railway system, which is being steadily extended 
U||and perfected, the Russian Army holds every strategic 
U||point that commands the northern provinces of Persia, 
U||what has Persia to show for the protection of such a 
U||long and vulnerable line of frontier? It is no exaggera- 
U||tion to say that with the exception of one small brigade, 
U||to which I shall refer presently, Persia has absolutely 
U||nothing in the shape of an army which could even 
U||harass the movements of a hostile army. On paper the 
U||Persian Army numbers about 80,000 men. In reality, 
U||barely half that number could be mustered, and if they 
U||were mustered, they would merely swell what Lord 
U||Curzon aptly described a.s “a loose aggregation of 
U||THE PERSIAN ‘^COSSACK’’ BRIGADE 
U||43 
U||slovenly units,” which in war must ‘^degenerate on the 
U||least provocation into a rabble,” Now and then 
U||reforms are talked about, but they come to nothing, 
U||and the Persian soldier, ill-disciplined, ill-officered, ill- 
U||equipped, and ill-paid, even when he gets his pay, is 
U||nothing more than a coolie in a tattered uniform, who 
U||can far more often be seen doing odd jobs in the streets 
U||as a manual labourer than performing any of the duties 
U||of military service. The sentries who are supposed to 
U||be “on guard” at the foreign Legations and Consulates 
U||are only too glad to be more usefully and lucratively 
U||employed in weeding the garden, or in “fagging” 
U||for the servants. Yet Persia unquestionably pos- 
U||sesses the raw material of an excellent army. The 
U||experiment of working up that material into an efficient 
U||force is, in fact, being already made, and the result is 
U||the one small brigade to which I alluded just now. 
U||But that solitary exception is not one which need cause 
U||Russia any apprehension. For the Persian “ Cossack ” 
U||brigade has been formed, and is officered, by officers of 
U||the Russian Army. 
U||In bygone times English, French, and Austrian 
U||officers have in turns taken in hand the task of re- 
U||organising the Persian Army, but owing to the lack of 
U||adequate support, if for no other reason, their efforts 
U||invariably ended in more or less ignominious failure. 
U||Russian officers were the last to appear upon the scene, 
U||and their success has been due, not only to the power- 
U||ful backing upon which they could depend, but to the 
U||business-like fashion in which they went to work. 
U||They never attempted to tackle the Persian Army as 
U||a whole. Acting upon the French proverb, Qui trop 
U||emhrasse^ mal Hreint^ they confined themselves to the 
U||organisation of a small force, entirely under their own 
U||44 
U||RUSSIAN ASCENDENCY IN TEHERAN 
U||control, which they could handle and mould to their own 
U||satisfaction. The whole brigade of Persian “Cossacks” 
U||consists of four regiments of cavalry, one of them 
U||called a Guards regiment, and of two battalions of field 
U||artillery. These regiments are not kept at their full 
U||strength, and the brigade only musters altogether 
U||about 2,000 men, originally recruited at random, but 
U||now chiefly drawn from one large tribe of Persian 
U||nomads. They are armed with Berdan rifles and 
U||Russian guns, and though they do not present on 
U||parade the spick-and-span appearance of our native 
U||Indian troops, all authorities concur in describing 
U||them as smart, alert, well-drilled, and well-disciplined. 
U||There are only three Russian officers attached to the 
U||brigade, but they have succeeded in training Persian 
U||officers and non-commissioned officers, as well as in 
U||drilling the rank and file. It is, however, only within 
U||the last few years that the brigade has attained its 
U||present high standard of efficiency, and this is largely 
U||due to the remarkable personality of its commander, 
U||Major-General Kosagowsky, whom the Tsar raised to 
U||that rank in the Russian Army, over the heads of a 
U||number of senior officers, in acknowledgment of the 
U||excellent work he had done at Teheran. Standing 6 feet 
U||3 inches or 4 inches in his boots and massively built, 
U||with a strong and energetic countenance, he looks every 
U||inch a born leader of men. A splendid organiser, he 
U||has thrown himself heart and soul into his work. He 
U||has personally designed and superintended the con- 
U||struction of the spacious new barracks overlooking the 
U||great Meidan or central square of Teheran, as well as 
U||the remodelling of some old Persian barracks adjoining 
U||them, and both men and horses are now housed in a 
U||way which had never before entered into the wildest 
U||A BORN LEADER OF MEN 
U||45 
U||dreams of a Persian soldier. By the general’s kind 
U||permission I was allowed to visit every part of the 
U||buildings, and in that land of universal dirt and un- 
U||tidiness it was a pleasure to see such order and clean- 
U||liness in the men’s quarters, as well as in the workshops 
U||and in the stables, while the smart, soldierly bearing of 
U||the men and their fine physique and general air of 
U||manliness and contentment showed what admirable 
U||materials for an army Persia still possesses. No doubt 
U||part of the secret of General Kosagowsky’s success is 
U||that the men are well fed, and, above all, regularly 
U||paid. On this point the General stands no nonsense, 
U||and, owing to the peculiar relations in which the 
U||Persian Government stands to the Russian Bank 
U||established a few years ago at Teheran, he has little 
U||difficulty in having his own way. He frames his own 
U||Budget, and he insists upon its requirements being 
U||complied with. If the Persian Treasury procrastinates, 
U||he draws upon the Russian Bank, and when the latter 
U||presents the bill, ways and means have to be found to 
U||meet it. Moreover, the General’s position is one of 
U||complete independence. He is not in any way sub- 
U||ordinate to the Persian Minister of War, but is under 
U||the orders of General Kuropatkin, the Russian Minister 
U||of War. His position, as far as the Cossack brigade is 
U||concerned, is in fact very similar to that which the 
U||British Serdar of the Egyptian Army occupies in Egypt. 
U||Even his men are withdrawn from the ordinary juris- 
U||diction of the Persian War Office, and a special depart- 
U||ment of the Persian Foreign Office deals with any 
U||question concerning them. 
U||The Shah is under deep obligations to General 
U||Kosagowsky, to whose influence the ease with which 
U||his Majesty made good his rights to the succession 
U||46 RUSSIAN ASCENDENCY IN TEHERAN 
U||after the assassination of his father must in no small 
U||measure be attributed. Muzaffer-ed-Din hesitated at 
U||first to assume the burden of what may well have 
U||appeared to him a dctfyifiosci hcTsditos* The tragic 
U||circumstances of his father’s death were calculated to 
U||unnerve a stronger man than he has ever shown himself 
U||to be. He suspected his brothers, the Zill-es-Sultan, who 
U||was Governor of Isfahan, and the NaYb-es-Sultaneh, 
U||who was Minister of War, and he insisted upon obtain- 
U||ing a written pledge of their loyalty before he seated 
U||himself on the throne. British influence secured the 
U||Zill-es-Sultan’s adhesion, which he indeed gave with 
U||every appearance of goodwill- The Naib-es-Sultaneh, 
U||probably out of sheer fright of committing himself 
U||to anybody or anything, showed more reluctance, 
U||and General Kosagowsky is believed to have used 
U||very peremptory arguments in overcoming it. When 
U||Muzaffer-ed-Din was at last solemnly installed, the 
U||Russian General’s drawn sword played a not in- 
U||conspicuous part in quickening the loyal sentiments of 
U||his Majesty’s lieges. That the Shah should have 
U||permanently at his disposal such an ef&cient force as 
U||the Cossack brigade goes far to assure the stability of 
U||his throne. 
U||On the other hand, as the Shah must be perfectly 
U||well aware that Russia’s interest in the stability of his 
U||throne is conditioned upon his subserviency to her, it 
U||is obvious that the existence of such a force, which has 
U||been practically created and is maintained solely by 
U||Russian influence, adds tremendously to the prestige 
U||as well as to the power of Russia, and not merely in 
U||Teheran. Such is the confidence the Russians are now 
U||able to place in the efficiency and devotion of their 
U||THE USES OF THE PERSIAN COSSACKS 47 
U||Persian Cossacks that they no longer find it necessary 
U||to keep them always under their own eyes. Detach- 
U||ments are sent away for a time into distant provinces. 
U||There are some, for instance, in the north-eastern 
U||province of Khorasan ; there are some in Arabistan, 
U||the south-western province which marches with the 
U||Turkish vilayet of Baghdad. On my way down to 
U||Isfahan I met a party proceeding to Yezd and Kerman 
U||in South-Eastern Persia. They are often appointed to 
U||act as guards or escort to provincial governors, and as 
U||such they are in a position not only to collect a great 
U||deal of useful intelligence for the Russian headquarters 
U||in Teheran, but to exercise in the same interest con- 
U||siderable local influence. Every one of these men 
U||carries to remote parts of the Persian kingdom not only 
U||the story of Russian might, but the praise of Russian 
U||methods ; and in this case the praise is not undeserved. 
U||Nor would it be fair to forget that the presence of such 
U||a force in the hands of Russian officers may sometimes 
U||be a guarantee for the maintenance of public security 
U||which enures to the benefit of foreign residents of all 
U||nationalities, as was clearly seen two years ago, during 
U||the bread riots provoked by the audacious attempt of 
U||the Governor of Teheran to engineer a corner in wheat. 
U||Whether, in the event of a great crisis, the Cossacks 
U||would be proof against an appeal to religious sentiment 
U||remains to be seen, for the influence of the Mullahs is 
U||still considerable. Whether they would remain at all 
U||costs true to their salt would probably depend, in a 
U||great measure, upon the personality of the Russian 
U||officer then in command. General Kosagowsky’s term 
U||of service in Persia expired last spring. It is difficult 
U||to replace a man of his stamp, and Colonel Zuboff, the 
U||48 RUSSIAN ASCENDENCY IN TEHERAN 
U||distinguished young officer who, at least temporarily, 
U||succeeded him, is of a different type. But the Cossack 
U||brigade will anyhow remain a significant and per- 
U||manent emblem of Russian military ascendency in 
U||Teheran, which, short of a Russian army of occupa- 
U||tion actually quartered in the Persian capital, could 
U||hardly be established on firmer and more durable 
U||foundations. 
U||CHAPTER VI 
U||RUSSIAN ASCENDENCY IN TEHERAN: THE 
U||POWER OF THE PURSE 
U||B esides the power of the sword Russia wields at 
U||the present moment in Teheran with at least equal 
U||might the power of the purse. The methods by which 
U||she has acquired it are similar to those which she has 
U||employed with so much success in China, and they 
U||aptly illustrate the intimate connection which exists 
U||between the Far Eastern and the Middle Eastern ques- 
U||tions. The activity of Russian diplomacy in Teheran 
U||during the last few years has constantly kept time with, 
U||and in many instances assumed exactly the same shape 
U||as, the activity which it has displayed during the same 
U||period in Peking. In both cases its guiding principles 
U||are the same, namely, that by bolstering up a weak 
U||and corrupt Oriental monarchy, and securing its com- 
U||plete subserviency by a judicious combination of force- 
U||ful pressure and pecuniary suasion, the ends of Russian 
U||policy can be, perhaps more slowly, but more surely 
U||attained, and at infinitely less cost and risk than by 
U||open and violent aggression. Nothing can be more 
U||instructive than the way in which history has been 
U||repeating, or rather duplicating, itself in Peking and in 
U||Teheran. 
U||In Peking the first manifestation of the ascendency 
U||E 
U||49 
U||so THE POWER OF THE PURSE 
U||she had gained over the Chinese Government by her 
U||intervention at the close of the Japanese war, when, 
U||with the help of France and Germany, she ousted Japan 
U||from the Liaotong Peninsula for her own ulterior pur- 
U||poses, was the loan which she compelled China to 
U||accept in June, 1895. The Customs revenue of China 
U||was still intact, and being practically under Western 
U||administration, it offered ample security for a loan 
U||concluded on ordinary business lines, which would have 
U||enabled her to meet the Japanese war indemnity. Ne- 
U||gotiations were actually proceeding with the representa- 
U||tives of leading European firms, whose joint co-opera- 
U||tion would have safeguarded the financial independence 
U||of China. Russia peremptorily vetoed the acceptance 
U||of those proposals and thrust the Franco-Russian loan 
U||upon the Chinese, as it were, at the point of the 
U||bayonet. It was a Franco-Russian loan in this sense, 
U||that Paris supplied the money, but it was the Tsar's 
U||signature which constituted the guarantee. It was 
U||towards Russia and not towards France that China 
U||found herself placed in a position of financial depend- 
U||ence, whilst Russia at the same time obtained a first 
U||lien upon the revenue of the Chinese Customs, to which 
U||no great power contributes a smaller fraction than Russia 
U||herself. The inevitable results were not slow to follow. 
U||A Russian bank— euphemistically called the Russo- 
U||Chinese Bank— was established in China, which speedily 
U||developed into a regular branch of the Russian Ministry 
U||of Finance, and the Russians obtained in the following 
U||year a concession for the construction of the ^‘Eastern 
U||Chinese Railway” to be connected with the Siberian 
U||Railway, which from those modest beginnings has ex- 
U||panded into a charter for the occupation of the whole 
U||of Manchuria and the creation of a great Russian 
U||THE PENURY OF THE SHAH’S TREASURY 51 
U||Viceroyalty firmly entrenched behind the guns of Port 
U||Arthur. 
U||I have thought it necessary briefly to recall these 
U||circumstances because Russia is so clearly applying in 
U||Persia the methods which she has found so successful 
U||in China. Into the causes which have driven Persia to 
U||have recourse to foreign loans I shall have occasion 
U||to refer later on. Suffice it for the present to say that 
U||when Muzaffer-ed-Din succeeded to the throne, he found 
U||the Treasury at a much lower ebb than he had expected, 
U||and the enormous expenditure which a succession 
U||always involves in Persia very soon depleted it. In 
U||1898 the Persian Government began to feel the pinch 
U||of poverty so severely that, when the Shah proposed to 
U||undertake a journey to Europe, there were no funds 
U||available for the purpose, and still less to meet heavy 
U||arrears of payment he could hardly leave the country 
U||without discharging. It was therefore decided to try and 
U||raise a considerable loan abroad. The Treasury had al- 
U||ready, in 1892, borrowed ;^5oo,ooo on the security of the 
U||Customs of the Persian Gulf from the Imperial Bank 
U||of Persia, a British institution founded with a great 
U||flourish of trumpets when Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff 
U||was at Teheran, for the purpose of fulfilling some at 
U||least of the functions of a state bank. The proceeds 
U||of that loan had gone to the payment of compensation 
U||for the abolition of the Persian Tobacco Monopoly — an 
U||ill-starred undertaking which, like the Persian Mining 
U||Corporation, had served mainly to give Persia a bad 
U||name in English financial circles. Unfortunately the 
U||Imperial Bank had also suffered, quite unfairly, from 
U||the discredit into which all Persian ventures had fallen, 
U||and as soon as, at the request of the Persian Govern- 
U||ment, it began to feel the pulse of the London money 
U||52 
U||THE POWER OF THE PURSE 
U||market, it became clear that without energetic support 
U||from the British Government there was little prospect 
U||of success for a Persian loan ; but in spite of the 
U||urgent advice of Sir Mortimer Durand, then British 
U||Minister at Teheran, official circles in London hesitated 
U||and procrastinated. The security offered was unques- 
U||tionably adequate, namely, the Customs revenues of 
U||Southern Persia; and in view of our important com- 
U||mercial and political interests in that region, it was 
U||eminently desirable that their control should not pass 
U||into other hands than ours. Whether it was necessary 
U||to insist upon immediate control of the Custom Houses, 
U||as the British capitalists demanded, instead of the 
U||eventual control which the Persians were ready to 
U||concede in case of default, is a disputable point. It 
U||was ostensibly on this rock that the negotiations were 
U||shipwrecked, though in return for a small advance 
U||of 50,000 to meet its most pressing requirements, the 
U||Persian Government had in the meantime consented to 
U||the Imperial Bank placing its own agents in charge 
U||of the Custom Houses at Bushire and Kermanshah. 
U||The delay caused by discussions on this point at any 
U||rate gave time for other influences to be exerted to 
U||defeat the negotiations. Whether Russian diplomacy 
U||went to the length of explicitly vetoeing the loan in the 
U||same way as, a few months before, it had vetoed at 
U||Peking the loan which was offered to China in January, 
U||1898, under the auspices of the British Government, 
U||it is difficult to say. The pressure that Russia was able 
U||to bring to bear indirectly upon the Shah through her 
U||own friends at Court was possibly sufficient for her 
U||purposes. The negotiations were broken off. The 
U||penury of the Persian Treasury went on increasing. 
U||The Amin-ed-Dowleh, who was suspected of British 
U||THE FIRST RUSSIAN LOAN S3 
U||leanings, fell into disgrace, and the Atabeg-Azam 
U||became once more Prime Minister in his stead under 
U||the powerful patronage of Russia. 
U||On the model of the Russo-Chinese Bank, and 
U||destined to become quite as undisguisedly a branch of 
U||the Russian State Bank under the immediate control of 
U||the Ministry of Finance at St. Petersburg, a Russian 
U||bank — the Banque des Prets, now called the Banque 
U||d’Escompte de Perse — had been opened at Teheran, 
U||and through its agency Russia, who had in the mean- 
U||time rejected a suggestion for a joint Anglo-Russian 
U||loan to Persia, agreed in 1900 to give the Persian 
U||Government a loan of ;£‘2,40o,ooo, represented by 
U||bonds guaranteed by the Russian Government and 
U||bearing interest at 5 per cent., with a sinking fund — 
U||capital and interest secured on the revenue of the 
U||Persian Customs generally, with the exception of the 
U||Persian Gulf ports. Whilst the Russians waived, 
U||except in the event of default, the right of control over 
U||the Customs upon which the British negotiators had 
U||insisted, they made it a condition that the proceeds of 
U||the new loan should be devoted, in the first instance, to 
U||the repayment of the balance of the British loan con- 
U||tracted in 1892 to provide compensation for the with- 
U||drawal of the ill-starred tobacco monopoly, and to 
U||redeeming the indebtedness of the Persian Treasury to 
U||the only two foreign banks in Teheran — the Imperial 
U||Bank of Persia, a British institution, and the Inter-^ 
U||national Bank of Commerce of Moscow, a private 
U||Russian firm, which could not attempt to compete with 
U||M. Witte’s Bank. Further stipulations provided that 
U||Persia should contract no financial obligations in the 
U||shape of a new loan from any foreign power for a 
U||period of ten years, and also that she should not 
U||54 
U||THE POWER OF THE PURSE 
U||lower her Customs duties, except with the consent 
U||of Russia. This loan, I should add, has never been 
U||publicly issued, nor has any information been made 
U||public as to the purposes, beyond those I have already 
U||mentioned, to which it has been applied. The relief 
U||that it afforded to the Persian Treasury was of short 
U||duration. It was issued nominally at 86|, with a 
U||commission of if per cent. Probably, therefore, when 
U||the outstanding balance of the Tobacco Monopoly loan, 
U||amounting to ;^400,ooo, and the other bank debts 
U||had been paid off, and commission and other charges 
U||deducted, the Treasury was left with little more than 
U||one million sterling to meet its most pressing needs. 
U||That sum was, at any rate, very soon exhausted, and 
U||towards the end of igor a further loan was contracted 
U||on the same security and through the same agency for 
U||another 16,000,000 roubles, or over one and a half 
U||million sterling. Even less is known as to the terms 
U||upon which this second loan was made, but the period 
U||during which Persia undertakes to contract no loans 
U||from other powers than Russia, without the consent of 
U||the latter, was extended to 1912, and, as a condition 
U||precedent, an agreement had been arrived at between 
U||Persia and Russia for a revision of the Persian Customs 
U||tariff. The proceeds of the second loan have not 
U||perhaps been quite so rapidly exhausted as those of 
U||the first, but in neither case has a penny been applied 
U||to any visibly useful purpose. It was stated in native 
U||circles at Teheran in the autumn of 1902 — and the 
U||report was generally credited— that, on his way back 
U||from Europe, the Shah had obtained the promise of 
U||another loan from Russia, and that it was in acknow- 
U||ledgment of this fresh favour his Majesty had spoken 
U||in such warm terms, at an ofiicial banquet given to him 
U||PERSIA’S INDEBTEDNESS 
U||55 
U||at Kursk, of the close ties which bind Persia to Russia, 
U||and which he hoped would bind the two countries still 
U||more intimately in the future. The promise, if it was 
U||given, does not however appear to have been yet ful- 
U||filled, or, at least, only very partially. The Persians, at 
U||any rate, only admit a total indebtedness to Russia of 
U||20,000,000 tomans, or ;^4, 000,000, which is the amount 
U||represented by the two above-mentioned loans. Even 
U||so, the significance of the financial dependence in 
U||which Persia has placed herself towards Russia in the 
U||course of such a very few years can hardly be over- 
U||rated. It cannot be fully appreciated until we have 
U||taken a survey of the economic and financial position 
U||of Persia as a whole ; but when a weak Oriental state, 
U||whose annual revenue only amounts to about one 
U||and a half million sterling, borrows from a powerful 
U||European neighbour,, and spends within the short space 
U||of three years, sums which almost equal the whole of 
U||its revenues during the same period, and has absolutely 
U||nothing to show in the way of remunerative expenditure 
U||for the debt which it is piling up, the ultimate result must 
U||spell ruin. 
U||It is often assumed in England that the financial 
U||policy by which Russia has reduced Persia to this state 
U||of dependence upon the Russian Treasury is directed 
U||solely towards building up her political ascendency. 
U||If that were so, those who contend that her political 
U||ascendency is not detrimental to British interests would 
U||be justified in regarding it with indifference. But this 
U||assumption ignores another equally important aspect of 
U||the situation. The financial policy of the Russian 
U||Government in Persia certainly promotes the ends 
U||which the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs may be 
U||specially supposed to have in view, but it is immediately 
U||56 THE POWER OF THE PURSE 
U||inspired and controlled by the Russian Minister of 
U||Finance, and it is directed towards building up the 
U||commercial supremacy quite as much as the political 
U||supremacy of Russia in Northern Persia. It is, in fact, 
U||merely part of the comprehensive system of policy to 
U||which M. Witte devoted his great abilities and untiring 
U||energy throughout his tenure of office. The impetus 
U||which he had given to the development of Russian 
U||industry by intensified methods of protection made 
U||it absolutely necessary for him to find new markets 
U||for the products of Russian industry. The severe 
U||crisis through which Russia was passing as a con- 
U||sequence of overproduction under artificial conditions 
U||only served to stimulate his activity. In Persia he 
U||discovered a market in which the advantage of geo- 
U||graphical proximity goes far to counterbalance the 
U||disadvantage at which such a hothouse growth as 
U||Russian industry is apt to find itself placed when in 
U||competition with the industry of other countries, and 
U||especially with British industry. If to geographical 
U||proximity he could superadd other advantages, he might 
U||well hope to turn the scales so completely in favour of 
U||Russian industry as to drive its competitors altogether 
U||out of the field. That its chief competitor happens here 
U||to be British industry, and that commercial rivalry 
U||therefore runs on the same lines as political rivalry, is 
U||merely an incident which no doubt adds zest to the 
U||game, 
U||W^hat is the position, and what are the trump cards 
U||which Russia appears to hold? The chief routes by 
U||which British trade reaches Teheran are, by the Persian 
U||Gulf, the Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan route, the Baghdad- 
U||Kermanshah route, and the new route via Muhammerah, 
U||the Karun river, and the Ahwaz-Isfahan road ; and by 
U||SUSPENSION 
U||THE RUSSIAN BOUNTY SYSTEM 57 
U||the Black Sea, the Trebizond-Tabriz route. The time 
U||of actual transit through Persia to Teheran by these 
U||routes ranges from seventy to one hundred and twenty 
U||days, and the cost from £18 to ;^26 per ton. On the 
U||other hand, the shortest road for the import of Russian 
U||goods into the Teheran district is from Enzeli via Resht 
U||and Kazvin, at rates varying from £6 to £8 per ton, 
U||the time of transit being from fifteen to twenty days. 
U||In these figures we see at a glance the benefit which 
U||Russian trade reaps from the outlay of Russian money 
U||on the construction of the road from Resht to Teheran. 
U||Nor is this by any means the only, or even the chief, 
U||avenue Russia has for her trade with Northern Persia, 
U||which enters the western provinces from Trans-Caucasia, 
U||and Khorasan from Ashkabad on the Trans-Caspian 
U||Railway. 
U||But the advantages of geographical proximity, sup- 
U||plemented by a judicious outlay of Russian capital on 
U||improved means of communication, were not enough 
U||to satisfy M. Witte. Until he was able to secure a 
U||revision of the Persian tariff, by which the duties were 
U||to be manipulated as far as possible in favour of 
U||Russian trade, he found means to counteract the 
U||competition of British goods in the Persian market by 
U||special railway rates for Russian products intended for 
U||Persia, and by an elaborate system of bounties paid by 
U||the Russian Treasury on all Russian goods exported 
U||into Persia. Great secrecy has been preserved with 
U||regard to the precise amount of these bounties, but they 
U||are believed in most cases to work out, roughly, to 
U||from 15 to 20 per cent, aci valorem^ and in some cases 
U||to much more. The Russian manufacturer, it must be 
U||admitted, has done apparently all that lies in his power 
U||to show himself worthy of the support he receives from 
U||58 
U||THE POWER OF THE PURSE 
U||the State. According to all accounts, he neglects no 
U||opportunity of cultivating the tastes of his Persian 
U||clients, and for variety, if not always for quality, he 
U||often succeeds in producing articles which are much 
U||better suited to the Persian market than his British 
U||competitor, whose intense conservatism will not stoop 
U||to any departure from time-honoured custom. Fashions 
U||vary in every province of Persia, and the Russians do 
U||their best to meet all their different requirements, whilst 
U||we seek to impose upon the whole country our concep- 
U||tion of what ought to be the fashion all over it. 
U||Russia has not, however, confined herself to the 
U||ordinary methods of promoting a state-aided industry. 
U||The Russian Bank at Teheran plays in this connection 
U||a scarcely less important part than in connection with 
U||the loans by which Russia has got so firm a grip on 
U||the Persian Treasury. The predominant position which 
U||the Banque d^Escompte de Perse has acquired as the 
U||creditor of the Persian State, it uses, without the slight- 
U||est disguise, for ousting British enterprise. Not only 
U||do its relations with the Persian Treasury give it special 
U||facilities for manipulating exchange on Europe for the 
U||benefit of Russian trade — a most important factor in 
U||all commercial transactions — but the large profits which 
U||it derives from its loan operations in Persia — Russia 
U||lends to Persia at a rate which works out to about 6 per 
U||cent, money which she can herself borrow in Paris 
U||at 4 per cent. — enable it also to carry on other opera- 
U||tions which no bank, run on purely business lines, 
U||could possibly undertake. Loans are made to Persian 
U||customers on consignments of goods, so long as those 
U||goods come from Russia, on terms which simply set 
U||ordinary business principles at defiance, and facilities 
U||which they would find nowhere else are granted to new 
U||THE BATTLE OF THE BANKS 
U||59 
U||customers on the express condition that they shall 
U||import their merchandise from Russia, or, at any 
U||rate, not from Great Britain. It is in competition 
U||especially with the Imperial Bank of Persia, the only 
U||British institution in the North, and one of almost 
U||vital importance to British trade, that these methods 
U||are practised in the most barefaced manner. The 
U||incurable apathy of the Persians and the growth of 
U||Russian ascendency have materially reduced the 
U||Bank’s opportunities of usefulness. The one im- 
U||portant privilege it enjoys is the issue of bank-notes — 
U||a privilege of which the value is much impaired by the 
U||large specie reserve it is compelled to maintain, not 
U||only in Teheran, but in its provincial branches, owing 
U||to the difficulty of making any large remittances of 
U||such a bulky currency as Persian silver in a country 
U||where transportation has to be computed, not in hours, 
U||but in weeks. Runs on the bank have already been 
U||engineered — hitherto unsuccessfully — in the hope of 
U||bringing about, by the sudden presentation of large 
U||numbers of bank-notes, a momentary suspension of 
U||specie payment, which would have furnished a pretext 
U||for procuring the revocation of its charter. From the 
U||Persian authorities, who frequently even wink at the 
U||evasion of the bank-note privilege of the bank by 
U||native corporations in the provinces, little or no assist- 
U||ance can be looked for. Beyond sundry advances, 
U||such as an impecunious Oriental treasury always 
U||stands in need of, the only service for which the 
U||Government still relies upon the Imperial Bank is 
U||the transmission to Teheran of Customs revenue 
U||collected in outlying districts where the Russian bank 
U||has at present no agents- Nevertheless, though the 
U||larger objects for which the Imperial Bank was created 
U||6o 
U||THE POWER OF THE PURSE 
U||have been so far defeated, the industry and perseverance 
U||of its staff, and especially the tact and ability of its 
U||chief manager, Mr. Rabino, whose personal influence 
U||with the Persians and with foreigners of all nationalities 
U||has been a most valuable factor, have in other respects 
U||maintained its credit and position. But the tactics 
U||which the Russian bank has adopted are hard to 
U||contend with, for the latter, backed by the Russian 
U||Ministry of Finance, has evidently made it one of its 
U||chief objects to drive its British competitor out of the 
U||field. For this purpose it is prepared to underbid it or 
U||outbid it, as the case may be, in every direction. A 
U||foreigner — not an Englishman — in an independent 
U||position at Teheran, who was in no way connected 
U||with business, told me that, when he wanted to draw 
U||upon Europe, the Russian bank was always prepared 
U||to give him a quotation fractionally more favourable 
U||than that at which the Imperial Bank had offered to do 
U||business. The Russian bank invariably asked him 
U||what rates the British bank quoted, and gave its own 
U||quotation accordingly. It is the same thing with 
U||loans, advances, discount, etc. The British bank has 
U||to consult the interests of its shareholders, and cannot 
U||afford to work at a loss. The Russian bank consults 
U||only the requirements of the policy it has been created 
U||to carry out, and is quite prepared to incur losses in 
U||promoting it. 
U||Such are the agencies through which Russia hopes 
U||to hold the central government of Persia — and with 
U||it the whole of Northern Persia at least — financially as 
U||well as militarily, in the hollow of her hand. The 
U||position of M. Struebe, the director of the Banque 
U||d’Escompte de Perse at Teheran, is the exact counter- 
U||part of that which M. Pokotiloff made for himself at 
U||THE CAPITAL OF PERSIA 
U||6i 
U||Peking as the director of the Russo-Chinese Bank. 
U||M. Struebe, a financial expert of remarkable ability, 
U||is the nominee and confidential agent of M. Witte, 
U||and corresponds directly with the Russian Ministry of 
U||Finance, just as the officer commanding the Persian 
U||Cossacks corresponds directly with the Russian Ministry 
U||of War. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear it 
U||whispered that the diplomatic representative of Russia 
U||at Teheran feels his position to be somewhat over- 
U||shadowed by his two powerful coadjutors. Possibly 
U||M. Arghyropoulo, who, when I was in Teheran, had 
U||just been transferred to another post, was not the man 
U||to assert himself, and his successor, M. Vlassow, who 
U||had hitherto represented Russia in Abyssinia, may 
U||be better qualified to play the part of ^‘the masterful 
U||Resident,’’ which properly belongs, according to the 
U||Russian Press, to a Minister Plenipotentiary of the 
U||Tsar at the Persian Court. Perhaps, after all, the 
U||Russian Government is wiser than the Russian Press 
U||in assigning, as it has hitherto done, to its diplomatic 
U||representative the more congenial task of supplying 
U||the ^uaviter in modo whilst the fortiter in re is driven 
U||home through other channels. It has, at any rate, 
U||every reason to be satisfied with the results that have 
U||hitherto attended its threefold representation at Teheran. 
U||It would be easy to enumerate other indications of 
U||the paramount influence of Russia in the Persian 
U||capital. Teheran has grown considerably of late 
U||years, and in spite of the tawdriness of its buildings 
U||and the hollow pretence of its long line of battle- 
U||mented walls, its broad, shaded avenues and stately 
U||gardens, and, above all, the noble amphitheatre of 
U||mountains which look down upon it from the north, 
U||give it a certain cachet of stateliness. But the red 
U||62 
U||THE POWER OF THE PURSE 
U||Russian blouses of the Cossacks at the gates of all 
U||the most important buildings and public departments, 
U||and, in the foreign quarter especially, the prevalence 
U||of notices and inscriptions in the Russian language, 
U||show clearly the predominance of the Russian element. 
U||During my stay a new development specially calculated 
U||to appeal to the Oriental imagination had taken place. 
U||The right of coinage is one which has always been in 
U||the East one of the chief attributes of sovereignty, and 
U||though the Persian Mint is notoriously inadequate to 
U||supply the needs of the country, the late Shah would 
U||never listen to any suggestion for having part of the 
U||silver currency struck abroad. Handsome 5-kran pieces, 
U||struck in Russia, or, more probably, for Russian account 
U||in Belgium, had just made their appearance in the 
U||bazaars of Teheran, and such is the state of the Persian 
U||silver currency that the new coins were welcomed with 
U||great satisfaction by the trading community. But the 
U||people were not unnaturally strengthened in their fatal- 
U||istic belief that the sovereign rights of Persia were 
U||gradually passing into the hands of her mighty northern 
U||neighbour. 
U||CHAPTER VII 
U||BRITISH TRADE AND RUSSIAN COMPETITION 
U||T he foreign trade of Persia resolves itself mainly 
U||into British trade, of which the trade to and from 
U||British India forms a very important part, and Russian 
U||trade. The trade between other Western countries and 
U||Persia is relatively insignificant, and the trade carried 
U||on between the adjoining provinces of Persia and 
U||Turkey is only of local importance. Unfortunately, 
U||the statistics available for dealing with this subject 
U||have not hitherto been very trustworthy. The Board 
U||of Trade returns include only the direct trade between 
U||the United Kingdom and Persia, and thus take no 
U||account of the large indirect trade from these islands, 
U||let alone the trade of India and other parts of the 
U||Empire with Persia. The British consular reports have 
U||hitherto furnished the best information available, but 
U||they have never laid claim to absolute accuracy, as in 
U||the absence of ojBficial data the returns they give have 
U||been necessarily incomplete in some cases, whilst in 
U||others they are apt to overlap. Nevertheless, from the 
U||more than usually exhaustive reports recently pub- 
U||lished from the British Consulates in the Persian Gulf 
U||ports, through which the bulk of our trade passes, at 
U||Kermanshah, which is the centre of the considerable 
U||trade carried on with Western Persia through Baghdad,

U||and in Meshed, which may be regarded as a terminus 
U||of the new overland trade-route from India via Quetta 
U||and Seistan, a fairly complete estimate of British trade 
U||with Persia can be compiled for 1902. Only for Tabriz, 
U||through which British goods still enter Northern Persia 
U||from the Black Sea, are the figures for 1902 not yet 
U||available, and one must fall back upon previous 
U||estimates of the value of British trade by that route : —

U||SOME UNPLEASANT STATISTICS 
U||65 
U||If we add ;£’200,ooo on the basis of former estimates 
U||for the British trade n)ia Tabriz, we arrive at an aggre- 
U||gate value of over 700,000 for the trade of 1902 be- 
U||tween Persia and the British Empire. This would. not 
U||compare unfavourably with Lord Curzon’s estimate of 
U||;£’3,ooo,ooo in 1889. But it is impossible to ignore the * 
U||statistics which are now forthcoming from an entirely, 
U||new source, namely, the Belgian Administration of the 
U||Persian Customs, and the picture they present of our 
U||commercial position in Persia is unhappily much less 
U||flattering, both positively and relatively. According to 
U||them, British trade in 1901-2 only amounted altogether, 
U||excluding the trade of Muhammerah, which had not 
U||yet been included within the operations of the Belgian 
U||Customs, to ;^2,35o,ooo, of which 1,895, 000 were im- 
U||ports into Persia, and less than half a million exports 
U||from Persia. Even if we add our own consular figures 
U||for British imports and exports via Muhammerah, the 
U||total barely reaches ;£’2, 600,000 for the whole of our 
U||Persian trade, or one million less than the British 
U||official estimates. 
U||Still more unsatisfactory are the Belgian Customs 
U||statistics if we are to accept their evidence as to the 
U||relative position of British trade and of that of our 
U||chief competitor in the Persian market. Russian im- 
U||ports are set down at ;£'2, 03 1,000 and Russian exports at 
U||;!fi, 600,000, or altogether ;^3, 63 1,000— just one million 
U||sterling in excess of the Customs returns of British 
U||trade.* If we compare these figures with Lord Curzon’s 
U||estimate of 1889, which put down the Russian import 
U||and export trade with Persia at about two millions 
U||* More detailed statistics of Russian trade with Persia, compiled from 
U||Russian sources, which have reached me too late to be noticed in this 
U||chapter, will be found in the Appendices. 
U||66 BRITISH TRADE AND RUSSIAN COMPETITION 
U||sterling, Russian trade has increased 8o per cent, within 
U||thirteen years, whilst British trade has decreased 15 per 
U||cent. Even if we do not accept the figures prepared 
U||by the Belgian Customs Administration as absolutely 
U||conclusive — and as far as British trade is concerned 
U||it is difficult to do so in view of our own Consular 
U||reports — it must, I fear, be admitted that Russian 
U||competition has already wrested from us the commercial 
U||supremacy we have hitherto enjoyed, and for many 
U||years, almost unchallenged, in Persia. 
U||Considering the immense activity which Russia has 
U||displayed of recent years in Persia, the rapid strides 
U||she has made in this direction are not surprising. 
U||Russian trade already enjoys, in addition to the initial 
U||advantage of close proximity to the markets of Northern 
U||Persia, the benefit, first, of relatively easy access to 
U||them over roads the construction and maintenance of 
U||which would have been impossible without the financial 
U||and political support of the Russian Government ; 
U||secondly, of an elaborate system of special rates to the 
U||frontier and bounties on export of which the Russian 
U||Treasury is willing to bear the burden, recouping 
U||itself the while by profitable loan transactions with 
U||Persia ; and, thirdly, of the vigorous pressure which 
U||Russia s political and financial ascendency enables her 
U||to exert through the channel of a powerful bank, which 
U||is in reality nothing less than a branch of the Russian 
U||Ministry of Finance. Fierce as, under such conditions, 
U||the competition to which Russia subjects British trade 
U||has already become, its full pressure will only begin 
U||to be felt under the new conditions arising out of the 
U||abrogation of the provisions of the Treaty of Turkman 
U||Chai, which until early in 1903 governed the trade 
U||relations of all foreign countries (except Turkey) with 
U||CUSTOMS REFORM 
U||67 
U||Persia. The sequence of events which has enabled 
U||Russia to proceed to a revision of her tariff relations 
U||with Persia is instructive. 
U||The only notable reform which has been carried out 
U||of recent years in the Persian administration is the 
U||reorganisation of the Customs service by a staff of 
U||Belgian Customs officials, lent for the purpose to the 
U||Persian Government. When the pressure of financial 
U||stringency first drove the Shah to contemplate a loan 
U||from European capitalists, it became evident that the 
U||only available security he had to offer was the revenue 
U||of the Persian Customs, and so long as the old system 
U||prevailed of farming out the different custom-houses, 
U||the security was not unexceptionable. The Persian 
U||Government was brought to realise that its value would 
U||be considerably enhanced by remodelling the Customs 
U||service on European lines ; and about five years ago 
U||application was made to Belgium as a ‘^neutral” 
U||state for the loan of the necessary personneL The 
U||King of the Belgians thoroughly appreciates the value 
U||to his own country of the opportunities afforded by 
U||such services, in countries where there is keen rivalry 
U||between the Great Powers, as, for instance, in China, 
U||where Belgium has been able to play an important and 
U||profitable part as the prete-^nom of Russia and France 
U||for the acquisition of railway concessions in the Yang- 
U||Tsze Valley and adjoining regions, which neither of 
U||those Powers could have invaded at the time without 
U||creating a dangerous amount of political friction. That, 
U||in the light of recent experience at Peking, Russia 
U||should have welcomed the introduction of a new Belgian 
U||element into Persia was natural enough, but that the 
U||British Government should have encouraged it, is hard 
U||to understand. Credit must, at any rate, be given to 
U||68 BRITISH TRADE AND RUSSIAN COMPETITION 
U||King Leopold for the selection of highly-competent 
U||ofiBcials to perform the honourable task assigned to 
U||them in Persia. M. Naus, the present Belgian Director- 
U||General of Customs, and the staff that his predecessor, 
U||who died shortly after arrival in Persia, brought from 
U||Europe, have done excellent administrative work, and the 
U||fact that they are merely seconded for service in Persia, 
U||and can at any time return to their own posts in Belgium, 
U||gives them a position, or, at least, an appearance, of 
U||independence here which the foreigners of all nation- 
U||alities who have from time to time drifted into the 
U||Persian service have generally lacked. Nevertheless, 
U||the success which has attended the reorganisation of 
U||the Persian Customs would probably not have been 
U||so remarkable as it has proved if, on the one hand, 
U||Russia had not, from the moment when she made her 
U||first loan to Persia, found it to her own interest to 
U||promote the improvement of the security on which she 
U||had lent her money, and, on the other hand, the Belgians 
U||had not displayed an intelligent readiness to accept 
U||Russian guidance and to deserve Russian protection. 
U||Towards the close of 1900, after a couple of years’ 
U||preliminary study and probation, M. Naus was able to 
U||point to an increase of 60 per cent, in the real revenue 
U||of the Customs over the returns of the last fina ncial 
U||year under the farming system, and to propose a 
U||complete scheme of reorganisation. Under the old 
U||system the actual duties paid on importation on the 
U||frontier were supplemented by a number of imposts 
U||levied more or less irregularly in transit into the markets 
U||of the interior, or in the shape of octroi at the place 
U||of destination. Indeed, the duties paid on importation 
U||were often considerably lower than the 5 per cent 
U||duty sanctioned by the Treaty of Turkman Chai. 
U||NEW CUSTOMS REGULATIONS 69 
U||Most of the custom-houses were farmed out by the 
U||Central Government, or administered by local chiefs 
U||subject to certain remittances to Teheran. The enter- 
U||prising farmer of one custom-house frequently en- 
U||deavoured to attract trade to his own port by offering 
U||to admit goods below the treaty rate, and in many 
U||places these reductions or rebates had in the course 
U||of time acquired a semi-legal sanction by mere pre- 
U||scription. On the other hand, as the foreign trader, 
U||when once his goods were landed in Persia, was to 
U||some extent protected against the exaction of transit 
U||dues and octrois, he was often placed in a better 
U||position than the Persian importer. M. Naus proposed 
U||to do away with these abuses by abolishing altogether 
U||the old transit dues and octrois on internal as well as on 
U||foreign trade, subject to a small transportation tax 
U||of 22 shahis, or less than per load on foreign goods 
U||for or from the interior ; and at the same time he 
U||undertook to increase the legitimate revenue of the 
U||Treasury by insisting upon the uniform payment of the 
U||full 5 per cent, duty at every port or land frontier 
U||station on the value of all imports and exports. The 
U||reforms laid down by M. Naus were adopted by the 
U||Persian Government with such unwonted promptitude 
U||as to suggest very powerful outside backing, and within 
U||the next twelve months the event had already justified 
U||his most sanguine prognostications ; for, while both 
U||internal and foreign trade was relieved of the old 
U||irregular imposts and benefited by the uniformity of the 
U||new system, the net revenue yielded by the Customs in 
U||1901 amounted to about 1,600,000 tomans, or nearly 
U||;^'320,ooo, as against little more than three-fifths of that 
U||sum under the farming system. 
U||70 BRITISH TRADE AND RUSSIAN COMPETITION 
U||In so far as Russian influence was exerted to promote 
U||these important reforms, it unquestionably conferred 
U||a considerable boon upon the trade of all foreign 
U||nations as well as upon the internal trade of Persia, 
U||But this was not the sole object of Russia in lending 
U||her support to the Belgium Customs administration. 
U||In Teheran and in the North, where her ascendency 
U||was too firmly established to require adventitious aid, 
U||the Belgians were careful to preserve outward appear- 
U||ances, and in spite of occasional complaints, they did 
U||not on the whole show any systematic unfairness in their 
U||dealings with foreign traders of whatever nationality. 
U||In the South and in the East, however, the part they 
U||had to play was a very different one. Russian interests 
U||in those regions not having yet materialised, the 
U||Belgian Customs officials had to prepare the way for 
U||them, and, pending their advent in a positive shape, at 
U||least counteract the growth of hitherto predominant 
U||British interests and obstruct their consolidation. I shall 
U||show later on, in dealing with the Persian Gulf and 
U||with Seistan, how zealously they have applied them- 
U||selves to the task set before them. Not that, in my 
U||opinion, we have any right to complain. It is in- 
U||evitable that Russia, to whom the Customs have been 
U||pledged, should make the most of the special interest 
U||she is entitled to take in their administration, and 
U||should insist even upon their administration being 
U||shaped in accordance with her own political aims. 
U||Unless she can rely entirely upon the devotion of the 
U||Belgians, she may easily be tempted, as the margin 
U||of her security diminishes with each additional loan, to 
U||insist upon taking the direct control of the Customs 
U||into her own hands, even in the absence of any specific 
U||default. The Belgians, too, know perfectly well that 
U||THE PART PLAYED BY THE BELGIANS 71 
U||without strong external pressure no progressive work 
U||can be done in Persia, and that not only is Russia in a 
U||position to apply that pressure, but that it suits her 
U||to apply it with regard to the Customs. The appoint- 
U||ment of a Belgian to the directorship of the Persian Post 
U||Office shows that Russia appreciates their co-operation. 
U||Why should they, who have no political interests of 
U||their own to serve, refuse their services to those who 
U||are willing and able to requite them generously ? 
U||However valuable to Russia was the control she thus 
U||acquired over an important administration, whose staff 
U||she can use, to some extent, as her agents in remote 
U||provinces of Persia, to which her own influence has few 
U||opportunities of direct access, it was only part of a 
U||much larger scheme. What she wanted was an ab- 
U||solute control of the fiscal policy of Persia with regard 
U||to foreign trade. A negative control she already pos- 
U||sessed ; for ever since 1828 the trade relations of Persia 
U||with foreign countries, except Turkey, have been practi- 
U||cally governed by the Treaty of Turkman Chai, which 
U||provided for a 5 per cent, ad valorem duty on Russian 
U||imports. Every Western country, including England, 
U||had been content, since then, to stipulate for the 
U||insertion in its treaties with Persia of a most-favoured- 
U||nation clause, under which it could claim the same 
U||commercial treatment that had been granted to Russia. 
U||Persia had, it is true, repeatedly applied to the Russian 
U||Government to modify the Treaty of Turkman Chai, 
U||so as to allow an increase of her Customs duties. But 
U||until Russia was in a position to insist upon the re- 
U||vision of the treaty being made in her own exclusive 
U||interests she always turned a deaf ear to Persian 
U||appeals. The recklessness of the Persian Govern- 
U||ment in piling up debts on the security of the 
U||72 BRITISH TRADE AND RUSSIAN COMPETITION 
U||Customs gave her creditor the long-looked-for oppor- 
U||tunity, It was now Russia’s turn to insist upon tariff 
U||revision. The interest and sinking fund of the first 
U||Russian loan of 1900 already absorbed nearly half the 
U||net revenue of the Persian Customs, and when the 
U||Shah applied in the following year for a further loan, 
U||one of the conditions upon which it was granted was 
U||that the Persian tariff should be revised in accordance 
U||with the wishes and interests of Russia. 
U||It is very significant that when M. Naus was urging 
U||upon the Persian Government the fiscal reforms above 
U||alluded to, he recommended them explicitly as a neces- 
U||sary preliminary to the revision of the Russo-Persian 
U||Treaty and an increase of the general tariff. The Shah, 
U||having entered upon a course of profuse expenditure 
U||which could only be met by continuous borrowing, 
U||could hardly be expected to resist the exigencies of an 
U||otherwise facile creditor. It was easy for Russia to 
U||satisfy him that his own interests would be served by 
U||tariff revision, since an increase of the tariff would 
U||place him in possession of fresh security to borrow 
U||upon, and so long as she did not claim any avowedly 
U||preferential treatment for Russian products, she could 
U||safely be allowed to manipulate the new tariff to her 
U||own advantage without technically laying Persia open 
U||to remonstrances from other powers. Anyhow, the 
U||Shah, being a suppliant for further pecuniary favours, 
U||was not in a position to argue with Russia. He could 
U||only obey. Russia insisted moreover upon absolute 
U||secrecy, lest England should at the last moment make 
U||some attempt to parry the blow which threatened her 
U||commercial interests. Again the Shah obeyed, and 
U||his obedience on this point furnishes perhaps the most 
U||striking evidence of how entirely he has ceased to 
U||A WELL-KEPT SECRET 
U||73 
U||be a free agent in his relations with Russia. All the 
U||conditions of an Oriental court render the maintenance 
U||of complete secrecy with regard to affairs of State, 
U||however confidential, extraordinarily difficult, and in 
U||Teheran, above all, anyone would have been laughed 
U||to scorn who contended that important negotiations 
U||could be carried through without any leakage of some 
U||sort. But on this occasion, at any rate, the Persians 
U||were made to feel the necessity of holding their tongue, 
U||and they held it, not for a few days or a few weeks, but 
U||for months, whilst they continued all the time to lend 
U||an ear to our representations on points of tariff, as if 
U||the question were still an open one. 
U||The new commercial convention was signed at Tehe- 
U||ran by the Persian and Russian plenipotentiaries, one 
U||of whom was an official of the Russian Ministry of 
U||Finance specially sent out for these negotiations, on 
U||November 9th — October 27th, O.S. — 1901, and more 
U||than a twelvemonth elapsed before the secret was 
U||divulged. In the meantime the Shah visited Europe, 
U||and came over to London in August, 1902. It was 
U||then still believed that the Russo-Persian negotiations 
U||had • not passed beyond the preliminary stage, and 
U||though there was much anxiety amongst those in- 
U||terested in Persian trade, it was not for a moment 
U||thought possible that Persia would have definitely 
U||committed herself to any measure so detrimental to 
U||British commercial interests of a century^s standing 
U||without communication with the British Government. 
U||In the course of a conversation I then had with 
U||the Atabeg-Azam, he was indeed good enough to 
U||intimate to me that there could be no question of 
U||Persia doing such a thing behind England’s back. 
U||That would, his Highness added, be a departure from 
U||74 BRITISH TRADE AND RUSSIAN COMPETITION 
U||the policy of maintaining as stable an equilibrium as 
U||possible between the interests of her two powerful 
U||neighbours, which the wisdom of his august master and 
U||his own experience of public affairs alike idealised to be 
U||the only policy Persia could safely pursue. Positive 
U||assurances had been given to that effect to the British 
U||Government, When the Persian Grand Vizier held 
U||this language to me with every appearance of sincerity, 
U||more than nine months had elapsed since he had 
U||appended his signature to the Russian Convention ! 
U||An Oriental potentate is no doubt always reluctant 
U||to refuse to his hosts any assurances they may ask for, 
U||especially when he anticipates receiving so coveted a 
U||distinction as the Order of the Garter has at all times 
U||been, and the assurances given during the Shah’s stay 
U||in England should perhaps never have been taken for 
U||more than the usual forms of complimentary rhetoric. 
U||M. Naus, the Belgian Director-General of Customs, who 
U||had been raised to the rank of Minister of State at Tehe- 
U||ran, in recognition of his services during the Russo- 
U||Persian negotiations, was just at that time engaged in 
U||removing the last possible obstacle to the success 
U||of the new arrangements. The Treaty of Erzeroum 
U||between Turkey and Persia was the only international 
U||engagement which still hampered the latter’s freedom of 
U||action in the direction desired by Russia. So long as 
U||the special regime which governed the trade relations 
U||of Turkey and Persia had treaty force, other powers 
U||could claim the benefit of it under the most-favoured- 
U||nation clause if it was less unfavourable to their 
U||interests than the Russo-Persian tariff. M. Naus pro- 
U||ceeded to Constantinople for the purpose of coming to 
U||an agreement with the Porte, and with the help of some 
U||concessions from Persia on other points, and of Russian 
U||THE RUSSO-PERSIAN CONVENTION 
U||75 
U||suasion, which was probably still more effectual, his 
U||mission proved easily successful. By the time the 
U||Shah had returned to his capital, everything was in 
U||order. On December 27th — December 13th, O.S. — 
U||1902, the ratifications of the Russo-Persian Convention 
U||of October 27th, 1901, were duly exchanged, and a 
U||protocol signed appointing February 14th, 1903, as 
U||the date at which the new tariffs were to come into 
U||force. 
U||CHAPTER VIII 
U||THE NEW COMMERCIAL CONVENTION 
U||WITH PERSIA 
U||B y a coincidence, of which the irony was presumably 
U||not undesigned, the first public announcement of 
U||the conclusion of the new Russo-Persian agreement, 
U||which dealt so deliberate a blow at the old-established 
U||trade relations of this country with Persia, was made 
U||from St. Petersburg on the very day — February 2nd, 
U||1903— on which Lord Downe, at the head of a special 
U||mission from King Edward, was investing the Shah in 
U||his palace at Teheran with the most illustrious order 
U||that a British sovereign can confer upon the head of any 
U||friendly and allied state. The publication of the terms 
U||of the Russo-Persian agreement was not calculated to 
U||remove the apprehensions of those who had repeatedly 
U||impressed upon the British Government the gravity 
U||of the danger which threatened British commercial 
U||interests in Persia. In none of our treaties with Persia 
U||during the last century had we taken any special pre- 
U||cautions to protect them, beyond the usual provision 
U||for the enjoyment by both parties of the treatment 
U||accorded by the other to the most-favoured nation. 
U||Russia was the only nation that had secured specific 
U||terms of treatment, viz. under Article 3 of the 
U||Separate Compact relative to Commerce, which 
U||76 
U||was 
U||SHAH AlJlUs r.RIDGi: OVI'R THI /I XHl 11 Rl’H (p 
U||MOST-FAVOURED-NATION TREATMENT 77 
U||appended to the Treaty of Turkman Chai of February 
U||2 1 St, 1828. Under that article imports and exports 
U||were to be subjected to a single duty of 5 per cent. 
U||ad valorem. This was an eminently moderate rate, 
U||and so long as British trade was assured of its per- 
U||manency there was nothing to complain of. But it 
U||never seems to have occurred to anyone that its 
U||maintenance depended not upon Persia and ourselves, 
U||but upon Persia and Russia, and that there could 
U||not therefore be any assurance of its permanency. 
U||In 1841, when we at last concluded a commercial 
U||treaty with Persia which had been foreshadowed in 
U||the preamble to the political treaty of 1814, and in 
U||1857, when tlie Treaty of Peace was concluded at 
U||Paris after the Anglo-Persian war, it would have 
U||been easy enough to have procured the insertion of 
U||a clause specifying the same tariff rates for Anglo- 
U||Persian trade which had been specifically granted to 
U||Russia. But this was not done, and so we continued 
U||to allow our interests to remain practically dependent 
U||upon the maintenance of treaty provisions to which we 
U||were no party, and over which we could have no direct 
U||control. This would have been an unsound position 
U||even if we could have relied upon Persia continuing to 
U||be a free agent. But, from the moment when the 
U||Persian Government passed under the complete as- 
U||cendency of Russia and succumbed into financial 
U||bondage to her, the position became one of obvious 
U||peril, and the end was clearly to be foreseen. 
U||The new Russo-Persian agreement imposes upon 
U||Persia a tariff of which the details have been elaborated 
U||in the sole interests of Russia. It is, as far as Persia 
U||is concerned, merely a revenue tariff, and as such, it is 
U||designed to increase just those revenues which she has 
U||78 COMMERCIAL CONVENTION WITH PERSIA 
U||mortgaged to Russia, with a view, probably, to facilitate 
U||further financial operations of the same ruinous charac- 
U||ter, It confers scarcely a single advantage on Persian 
U||trade, and from a commercial point of view, contains 
U||hardly any of those features of reciprocity which char- 
U||acterise commercial conventions between independent 
U||and equal powers. As far as Russia is concerned, it 
U||materially improves the security of the loans she has 
U||already made to Persia, and provides a margin for 
U||fresh loans should she deem it expedient to tighten her 
U||hold upon the Persian Treasury. It practically dis- 
U||criminates in her favour against the trade of her only 
U||serious rival in the Persian markets, viz. British and 
U||British-Indian trade, by substituting for a single ad 
U||valorem duty leviable at the same rate on all imports and 
U||exports a complicated system of specific duties, under 
U||which the chief imports and exports in which Russia 
U||is mainly interested are treated with relative lenience, 
U||whilst those which chiefly affect Great Britain and 
U||India are severely penalised. It is thus calculated to 
U||prove a powerful instrument for promoting the com- 
U||mercial ascendency of Russia in Persia, which M. 
U||Witte set himself to establish, and it consecrates 
U||her political ascendency by stipulating that it shall 
U||never be modified without the consent of the Russian 
U||representative at Teheran, and that Russian subjects 
U||shall be privileged to pay the duties in Russian bank- 
U||notes— a provision of which, besides the material bene- 
U||fit for Russian currency purposes, the moral effect 
U||cannot fail to be considerable in an Eastern country 
U||where the coin of the realm is an almost sacred symbol 
U||of sovereignty, and a peculiar significance will be 
U||attached to the right of legal tender in the paper 
U||currency of a foreign power. 
U||A LETTER TO THE BOARD OF TRADE 79 
U||The technical details of the Russo-Persian tariff it is 
U||hardly within the competency of a layman to discuss. 
U||But one of the leading British firms in the Persian 
U||trade subjected it to a careful analysis immediately after 
U||its publication, and embodied some of the results in a 
U||letter to the Board of Trade, from which I cannot do 
U||better than quote the following extract: — 
U||“Under the most-favoured-nation clause British 
U||goods are subject to the provisions of the Treaty of 
U||Turkman Chai (1828), fixing the Persian duties, both 
U||import and export, at 5 per cent, ad valorem. We 
U||have endeavoured to estimate the nature of the change 
U||which would be introduced by the present tariff. For 
U||this purpose we propose to deal in the first place with 
U||imports into Persia, and next with exports from Persia. 
U||Our calculations are based upon the value of the 
U||various articles at the Karun ports : —

U||“The following facts are deserving of notice in 
U||connection with these tables : — 
U||“(1.) Inasmuch as our experience mainly bears upon 
U||the Persian Gulf ports, where Russian trade is as yet 
U||practically non-existent, we have not dealt with articles 
U||of export and import to and from Russia. But it is 
U||well known that some of the principal articles of import 
U||from Russia are piece goods, bounty-fed sugar, and 
U||petroleum. As regards the last, Mr. Maclean estimates 
U||that the proposed tariff works out to per cent, ad 
U||valorem — ^a reduction of 3 J per cent, on the present tariff. 
U||Russian piece goods will, of course, be taxed equally 
U||with British ; but it is to be noted that the change 
U||from an ad ^valorem to a weight tariflF will very greatly 
U||advantage Russian goods. Russian piece goods are 
U||much more expensive at the port of entry on the north 
U||than are the corresponding Manchester goods at the 
U||BRITISH TRADE HANDICAPPED 
U||8i 
U||port of entry on the south. Therefore, a hundred- 
U||weight of Russian goods pays much more under the 
U||present tariff than a hundredweight of corresponding 
U||goods made in Manchester. The benefit which we 
U||derive from our better methods of production will now 
U||be taken away from us. For the proposed tariff is a 
U||tariff on the weight. It may be asked how Russian 
U||goods of higher price at the port of entry can compete 
U||with British goods. The answer is that British goods 
U||have to travel further before reaching the principal 
U||Persian centres. They are under a disadvantage as 
U||regards the transport by land, both in respect of distance 
U||and facilities, as, for instance, roads. As regards 
U||sugar, it will be seen that the present tariff is not 
U||materially changed. But no doubt this is due to the 
U||large quantities of sugar which are imported from 
U||Russia. It is possible that this sugar is of greater 
U||value at the port of entry on the north than is the 
U||Continental sugar on the south ; for we notice that 
U||Mr. Maclean works out the proposed tariff, presumably 
U||on Russian sugar, at 2J per cent., a reduction of 2| per 
U||cent, on the existing tariff. 
U||^‘( 11 .) As regards the exports, some of the principal 
U||articles which we export are wheat, grains of various 
U||descriptions, linseed, sesame seed. It is noteworthy 
U||that, whereas the duties on these articles have been in- 
U||creased by percentages varying from 3^- to 20 per cent., 
U||the corresponding articles of export to Russia on the 
U||Caucasian frontier, such as dried fruits, raisins, almonds, 
U||See., are exempted altogether from duty. Rice, which 
U||is largely exported to Russia, but not to Great Britain 
U||or India, has a reduction of 2 per cent, on the present 
U||tariff. Cotton, which is only taken by Russia, is to be 
U||exported free. On the other hand, opium, practically 
U||all of which is exported to British possessions, will have 
U||an increase of 8 per cent, on the present tariff. 
U||^‘(III.) Certain features of the tariff appear to us to 
U||be preposterous, such as the tax of 100 per cent, on tea, 
U||G 
U||82 COMMERCIAL CONVENTION WITH PERSIA 
U||practically all of which comes from India. Also the 
U||differentiation of the export duties, to which we have 
U||already alluded, according as the products are such as 
U||are taken by Russia or by the United Kingdom and 
U||India. 
U||‘^(IV.) But perhaps the principal object of solicitude 
U||in the eyes of his Majesty^s Government would naturally 
U||be the Manchester piece goods trade, because of its large 
U||proportions. We estimate that the annual value of 
U||piece goods, mainly of British or Indian origin, imported 
U||into Persia must be getting on for two million sterling 
U||a year. These goods enter Persia from : — 
U||(a) Persian Gulf Ports 148,500 
U||(b) F2/2 Trebizond ... 126,000 
U||{c) Via Baghdad and Kermanshah ... 500,000 
U||;^L774,Soo 
U||We have not included the growing traffic upon the 
U||Quetta-Nushki route. All this valuable trade has been 
U||built up by an immense amount of individual effort 
U||on the part of British merchants as well as of British 
U||officials, extending over a period of nearly a century. 
U||The substantial increase in the tariff will naturally raise 
U||the prices of these piece goods to the consumer, and 
U||will consequently restrict the import into Persia to a 
U||corresponding extent. Moreover, the advantage con- 
U||ferred by the tariff upon cotton goods of Russian origin, 
U||which we have explained above, will tend to penalise 
U||the cheap goods of British manufacture as compared to 
U||the similar, but more costly, Russian goods, which, 
U||impelled by the energy of the Russian Government, 
U||are every day penetrating further into Persia and dis- 
U||placing British goods.” 
U||The position in which British trade with Persia was 
U||placed by the new Russo-Persian tariff was one not 
U||only of great difficulty, but of extreme urgency. That 
U||tariff was to come into force on February 14th, 1903, 
U||A RUDE AWAKENING 
U||83 
U||and without any kind of notice British trade was to 
U||be subjected to its provisions. British diplomacy at 
U||Teheran, deliberately lulled to sleep, had a rude 
U||awakening. A convention directly affecting some of 
U||our most important interests had been concluded by 
U||the Persian Government behind our back, and when 
U||the Persian Government at last obtained permission 
U||from Russia to communicate it to the British Legation 
U||at Teheran the British Government found itself in pre- 
U||sence of a fait accompli more than a year old. It was 
U||far too late to attempt to reverse it, or even to secure 
U||a postponement of its effects. What formal grounds 
U||of complaint had we got? We had been content to 
U||put our faith in most-favoured-nation treatment. That 
U||treatment we still had and should continue to have — 
U||for what it was worth. We might plead that, apart 
U||from all the pledges given and broken by the Persian 
U||Government, such a bolt out of the blue was scarcely 
U||consonant with customary relations of amity, and that 
U||so sudden a disturbance of the conditions upon which 
U||our trade with Persia had been based for the best part 
U||of a century would be as injurious to Persian interests 
U||as our own, seeing that we were still Persia’s chief 
U||customers. But such arguments could have no effect 
U||upon a Government which had ceased to be a free 
U||agent, and whatever Persia might have been willing to 
U||do, Russia was not going to forego for a single day 
U||the benefit of the diplomatic coup she had so success- 
U||fully brought off. 
U||There were only two courses open for the British 
U||Government. The one was to enter a protest against 
U||the unfriendly character of Persia’s action in carrying 
U||out such a drastic revision of her tariff without con- 
U||sultation or communication with her chief commercial 
U||84 COMMERCIAL CONVENTION WITH PERSIA 
U||client, and to let the new tariff be enforced against us 
U||until an opportunity should arise of bringing such 
U||pressure to bear upon Persia as would compel her to 
U||negotiate a commercial treaty on terms less unfavour- 
U||able to British trade. The other course was to acquiesce 
U||in the fait accompli and, lest worse things should befall 
U||us, at least tie the Persian Government down to a 
U||specific engagement that should prevent any further 
U||tampering over our heads with the conditions of our 
U||own trade with Persia. The first course might have 
U||been more dignified, but in the existing situation 
U||at Teheran we might have waited indefinitely for an 
U||opportunity of securing more favourable terms from 
U||the Persian Government, and, before such an oppor- 
U||tunity ever arose, Russia might, on the other hand, 
U||have discovered in the light of experience that the new 
U||tariff still left room for improvement from her point 
U||of view, and compelled the Persians to revise it once 
U||more for her benefit. In that case, with still nothing 
U||but our most -favoured -nation clause to lean on, 
U||we should have been as helpless as ever to resist a 
U||fresh turn of the Russian thumb-screw. The second 
U||course, at least, locked the stable door ; and though the 
U||best horse had already been stolen, we could make 
U||sure of keeping, at any rate, the nag, though a sorry 
U||one, which took its place. This appears to have been 
U||the view which commended itself to the British Govern- 
U||ment, and, in the circumstances, no doubt on the whole 
U||rightly, if one may judge from the annoyance mani- 
U||fested by the Russians. A convention was rushed 
U||through at Teheran, and signed on February gth, 1903, 
U||four days before the Russo-Persian tariff came into 
U||effect. 
U||Though it made the best of a bad bargain, it must 
U||AN UNSATISFACTORY DOCUMENT 85 
U||have been very galling for Sir Arthur Hardinge to 
U||have to affix his signature to so unsatisfactory a docu- 
U||ment. On the face of it, it merely gives a British 
U||imprimatur to the far-reaching changes in the com- 
U||mercial regime of Persia, which Russia had extorted 
U||from the Shah’s Government for the benefit of Russian 
U||interests in the struggle between this country and 
U||Russia for the Persian markets. The Persian im- 
U||port tariff, sanctioned by Article 1. of the British Con- 
U||vention, is identically the same as that appended to the 
U||Russian Convention. Even in theory, we who give 
U||Persia the benefit of our open markets all over the world 
U||for her exports, get at best the same treatment for our 
U||imports into Persia which she gives to ultra-protectionist 
U||Russia. In fact, she gives us much worse treatment, 
U||for her tariffs have been carefully framed for her under 
U||Russian dictation for the benefit of Russian trade and 
U||for the detriment of ours, the goods she takes from 
U||us being much more heavily taxed than those she 
U||takes from the Russians. The Persian export tariff, 
U||drawn up in the same spirit, presses heavily upon such 
U||Persian products as are chiefly exported to British 
U||markets, whilst those which are in demand in Russia 
U||are treated with conspicuous indulgence. 
U||Article II. contains a very singular provision. It 
U||confers upon Persia the right to raise her duties upon 
U||British imports in the event of any change in British 
U||fiscal policy which would lead to duties being imposed on 
U||certain Persian goods higher than those enumerated in 
U||a tabular statement of Russian duties on merchandise 
U||of Persian origin, i,e, that, though in return for the 
U||benefit of our existing free-trade system Persia con- 
U||cedes to us nothing to-day which she does not concede 
U||to Russia, she reserves the right of penalising our trade 
U||86 COMMERCIAL CONVENTION WITH PERSIA 
U||if we change our system. Nor is this all. As the 
U||Convention stands, she reserves equally the right of 
U||penalising any British colony with an independent fiscal 
U||system that should cease to accord to Persia the most- 
U||favoured-nation treatment — an extraordinary provision 
U||for the British Minister to have ever accepted, especially 
U||in view of the fact that British trade with Persia is 
U||largely Anglo-Indian trade. Fortunately this pro- 
U||vision has been practically rescinded, under pressure 
U||from the Imperial Government, since the Convention 
U||was signed. 
U||Article III., by explicitly admitting without any 
U||limitation or control the right to prohibit the exporta- 
U||tion of cereals on the plea of securing the food of the 
U||people, is only too well calculated to perpetuate one of 
U||the Persian administrative abuses most detrimental to 
U||trade. There are few greater adepts in the lucrative 
U||art of engineering a “corner” in grain than Persian 
U||oHicials. 
U||The abolition of the local tolls levied on caravan 
U||routes which is conceded by Article IV., is a largely 
U||illusory provision, for the old caravan routes are being 
U||gradually superseded by roads built with European 
U||capital, upon which special tolls are leviable under the 
U||concessions granted for their construction. Moreover, 
U||it is the tolls levied on the Resht-Teheran road, con- 
U||trolled by the Russians, which are adopted as the 
U||standard of tolls to be levied on other roads. 
U||The value of the detailed regulations respecting 
U||custom-house procedure to be drawn up according to 
U||Article V. in agreement with the British Legation will 
U||be determined by the spirit in which they are applied. 
U||What that spirit is likely to be may be estimated from 
U||what I have already had occasion to say about the 
U||A SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION 
U||87 
U||Belgian administration of Persian Customs. As a 
U||Belgian official remarked in an audible aside to a 
U||colleague, which I was presumably not intended to 
U||overhear or expected to understand: ‘‘Mais nous 
U||sommes, done, ici pour embeter les Anglais.’^ 
U||Instead of simply laying down a normal rate of 
U||exchange between Persian and British currency for 
U||purposes of custom-house payments, such as is laid 
U||down in the Russo-Persian Convention between Persian 
U||and Russian currency, Article VI. of the British Con- 
U||vention enacts a circuitous modus operand^ by which 
U||the Persian krans are first to be converted at a given 
U||rate into French francs — a coin absolutely unknown in 
U||Persia — and then the equivalent of the latter worked 
U||out in British currency. It is not surprising that this 
U||roundabout method has already given rise to com- 
U||plaints from British traders. 
U||The last article of the Convention, though purely 
U||formal, is by no means the least significant. All 
U||previous treaties between this country and Persia have 
U||been drawn up in English and Persian. This Con- 
U||vention is drawn up in French and Persian, and 
U||Article VI. provides that, in case of discrepancies, the 
U||French text is to be deemed authoritative. Both from 
U||internal evidence and from a comparison of dates it is 
U||clear that the British Convention was very hastily 
U||drawn up, and is little more than a copy of the Russian 
U||Convention. It is easy also to surmise the reasons for 
U||this procedure, but it none the less shows only too 
U||plainly the shifts to which British diplomacy was re- 
U||duced. It is quite pathetic to note how in one of the 
U||notes addressed by Sir Arthur Hardinge to M. Naus, 
U||which have been published with the Convention, the 
U||British Minister assures the Persian negotiator in 
U||88 COMMERCIAL CONVENTION WITH PERSIA 
U||almost apologetic terms that, though the new tariffs will 
U||not be promulgated in England until some weeks after 
U||they have come into force, the delay will be of no 
U||practical consequence to Persia, as they do not affect 
U||the treatment actually applied to Persian trade in the 
U||British Empire. As to the serious consequences to 
U||British trade of the enforcement of the enhanced tariffs 
U||in Persia without any adequate notice of impending 
U||change to those immediately concerned, the British 
U||Minister has not a word to say. 
U||I have dwelt at some length on the significant pecu- 
U||liarities of this Convention, because even those who 
U||pooh-pooh our political interests in Persia can hardly 
U||view with satisfaction a situation which reacts so un- 
U||favourably upon our commercial interests. The value 
U||of our Persian trade, and especially of the direct trade 
U||between the United Kingdom and Persia, is no doubt 
U||small when compared with the total volume of our 
U||foreign trade. But the importance of the question 
U||cannot be estimated solely in £ s. d., and it is certainly 
U||not diminished by the fact that our Persian trade is 
U||largely an Anglo-Indian trade, and therefore directly 
U||affects the interests of our great Indian dependency. 
U||It is worth noting, as an illustration of our methods, 
U||that, whereas , Russia sent out an expert from the 
U||Ministry of Finance to take part in the commercial 
U||negotiations at Teheran, the British Board of Trade 
U||waited until our Convention, such as it is, was con- 
U||cluded before sending out an official to report upon it, 
U||mainly, it may be presumed, with the object of showing 
U||that it is not so injurious to our trade as it might have 
U||been.

U||CHAPTER IX 
U||THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF PERSIA 
U||I T is difficult for the European to pass judgment 
U||upon an Oriental system of government, or rather 
U||it is all too easy. We apply to it our own standards, 
U||and immediately rush to the conclusion, not only that 
U||the system is in itself abominably bad, but that it must 
U||be as intolerable to those who live under it as it would 
U||be to ourselves, and that, therefore, it cannot possibly 
U||endure. But our standards are not those of the East. 
U||What is intolerable to us is not merely tolerated by the 
U||Oriental, but is invested in his eyes with the one 
U||sanction which he reveres, namely, that of long- 
U||descended custom ; and the very notion of change is 
U||almost more abhorrent to his conservative mind than 
U||any of the evils at the mere thought of which the 
U||Western mind revolts. Judged by Western standards, 
U||the Persian system of government, which, now that the 
U||Khanates of Central Asia have passed out of existence, 
U||represents — in a less modified form than Turkey, or 
U||even, perhaps, than Afghanistan — ^the last surviving 
U||type of the mediaeval Asiatic monarchies founded by 
U||the Moslem sword, stands irrevocably condemned. 
U||It is in theory an absolute despotism, and though, 
U||like every other despotism, it is subjected in practice to 
U||certain restraints, they do little to mitigate in Persia the 
U||89 
U||92 
U||THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF PERSIA 
U||has worked in much the same shape as we see at present 
U||for centuries past, surviving all the changes of dynasty 
U||and vicissitudes of fortune that Persia has endured in 
U||the course of her chequered history. With a few 
U||modifications of costume the bas-reliefs of Persepolis 
U||might serve to illustrate just as well the manners and 
U||customs of official Persia under Muzafifer-ed-Din Shah 
U||as under Xerxes and Darius. Attempts are sometimes 
U||made to palliate the more glaring faults of the existing 
U||system by explaining away the sale and purchase of 
U||offices as a clumsy method of securing the payment of 
U||revenue, and the elaborate machinery of mudakhil^ or 
U||official perquisites, as a speculative substitute for the 
U||regular salaries attaching to office in more civilised 
U||countries. These attempts appear to me to be laboured 
U||and needless. The true explanation of the survival of 
U||such an apparently ruinous system of government ought, 
U||I think, to be sought in its rudimentary simplicity, and 
U||in the scope it gives to the individual ability of a strong 
U||ruler. Time after time Persia has been on the point of 
U||sinking in the mire of corruption, which such a system 
U||in weak and incompetent hands is bound to produce, 
U||and the country, driven to desperation, has fallen into 
U||a state of chaotic anarchy, the ultimate expression of 
U||popular discontent. Then a strong man like Shah 
U||Abbas, or Nadir Shah, or Agha Muhammed, the 
U||founder of the reigning dynasty, has arisen, and by 
U||sheer force of character and rough-and-ready methods 
U||has set the primitive machinery of government once 
U||more in motion. On a smaller scale the same process 
U||takes place from time to time in the different provinces 
U||of the kingdom. Under a feeble or more than usually 
U||grasping Governor the province lapses into a state of 
U||chronic turbulence. That is the one administrative sin 
U||PERSIAN IDEAS OF GOVERNMENT 
U||93 
U||for which it is hard to purchase forgiveness. A strong 
U||Governor is sent down to put things straight, and, 
U||whatever may be thought of the methods he employs, 
U||the desired result is achieved to the satisfaction not only 
U||of the monarch whom he represents, but of the people 
U||whom he is set over. For the highest praise which the 
U||Persians can bestow upon the man in authority over 
U||them is not that he is a just man, or a kindly man, or 
U||even a generous man, but that he is a strong man — 
U||so instinctively do they realise that it is only a strong 
U||man who can work such an unwieldy system of 
U||government without abnormal friction. As for the 
U||merits or demerits of the system, it is the one to 
U||which they have been accustomed for centuries, and 
U||the vast majority know and can conceive of none 
U||other. 
U||On its own merits, though it may not fulfil a single 
U||one of the functions which we usually associate with 
U||the idea of government, there would be no more reason 
U||to assign a term to the Persian system of government 
U||to-day than at any other critical period in the history of 
U||the country, were there any prospect that Persia would 
U||be allowed to work out her own destinies free from outside 
U||interference. In no Eastern land — not even in China 
U||— have the moral and intellectual forces of the West 
U||penetrated so little amongst the people as in Persia, or, 
U||to judge by the few Persians of the higher classes 
U||who have been educated or have travelled abroad, exer- 
U||cised so little permanent influence upon those actually 
U||brought into contact with them. In spite of a common 
U||Aryan origin to which the Persian language still bears 
U||witness, the infusion of other Asiatic strains of blood, 
U||and still more, the ascendency of Islam, have fixed a 
U||profound gulf between the Persian and the European 
U||94 
U||THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF PERSIA 
U||mind. Violent changes may take place again, as they 
U||have taken place in the past, from purely internal causes, 
U||in the personnel of government, but it is difficult to 
U||imagine from what quarter within Persia itself could 
U||proceed the initiative of any change that should radi- 
U||cally affect the system of government, unless perhaps 
U||it were the result of some great religious movement 
U||such as Babiism was, and still is by some, believed to 
U||portend. 
U||But an Oriental system of government, which may 
U||be proof against the moral and intellectual impact of 
U||the West, and, if left to itself, might continue to 
U||command submission, and even approval, at the hands 
U||of a totally ignorant people trained to fatalistic resigna- 
U||tion, is exposed to entirely new perils when it is 
U||suddenly brought face to face with the material forces 
U||of the West. None of those material forces has proved 
U||more subversive of the old order of things in Oriental 
U||states than the facilities which our modern system of 
U||credit has opened up for the facile acquisition of wealth 
U||by their rulers. Contact, even of the most superficial 
U||kind, with the Western world stimulates them to new 
U||conceptions of luxury, new forms of extravagance 
U||which cannot be gratified out of the resources hitherto 
U||at their command, and the Western world is generally 
U||ready enough to furnish them with the means of grati- 
U||fying these new tastes — on its own terms, bien entendu 
U||— ^whether in the shape of a financial operation on 
U||purely business lines, or in that of a politico-financial 
U||transaction such as the last few years especially have 
U||brought into fashion. Persia has been the last Oriental 
U||state to avail itself of these dangerous facilities, but the 
U||recklessness with which it is making up for lost time is 
U||a feature of which the gravity can hardly be overrated 
U||A SPARSELY POPULATED KINGDOM 95 
U||in connection not only with its foreign relations, but 
U||also with the internal condition of the country. In 
U||proportion to her existing resources Persia is piling 
U||up a debt which in the course of a few years must, at 
U||the present rate, prove wholly unmanageable. 
U||All statistics with regard to Persia have to be accepted 
U||with great caution, as there are no authoritative data 
U||upon which they can be based. None appear to be, 
U||on the whole, more trustworthy than those compiled 
U||for the Supplement to the Encyclopcedia Britannica by 
U||a European official, whose long record of able and 
U||loyal service under the Persian Government affords an 
U||honourable contrast to the records of most Europeans 
U||who have from time to time drifted into Persian employ, 
U||and perhaps for that very reason have received but 
U||scant recognition. Imperfect as they necessarily are, 
U||these statistics tell their own tale even to those who, 
U||not having seen Persia, can hardly be expected to 
U||realise their full meaning. Persia is at present an 
U||essentially poor country. It extends, roughly, about 
U||700 miles north and south, and 900 miles west and east, 
U||over an area of 628,000 square miles. But the greater 
U||part of this area is very sparsely populated. A liberal 
U||estimate puts the population in 1881 at about 7,650,000 
U||souls, of whom 2,000,000 in the towns, 3,800,000 in 
U||the villages, and the rest nomads. But it is doubt- 
U||ful whether the population much exceeds 6,500,000. 
U||and this would give an average of barely more than 
U||ten inhabitants per square mile. With the exception 
U||of Teheran, there is scarcely a city that does not show 
U||unmistakable signs of shrinkage, and one of the most 
U||melancholy features all over Persia is the number of 
U||deserted villages. No doubt the potential resources 
U||of the country are considerable, and under an intelligent 
U||96 THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF PERSIA 
U||administration capable of very great development ; but 
U||as things are at present Persia is growing, and is bound 
U||to grow, poorer every year. Estimated in krans, the 
U||base silver currency of the country, the revenue which 
U||reaches the Treasury has to some extent increased. 
U||In 1876 it amounted to 58,000,000 krans, in 1890 to 
U||60,000,000, and to-day it amounts possibly to 70,000,000 
U||or 75,000,000. But even this increase is due mainly to 
U||the new system of administering the Customs. The 
U||direct revenue produced by the maliatj a sort of com- 
U||bined land and industrial income tax which affords the 
U||best test of national prosperity, has remained almost 
U||stationary. In reality, however, the conditions are 
U||very much worse, and the nominal increase is con- 
U||verted^ into a very considerable decrease as soon as 
U||we take into account the heavy fall in the value of the 
U||white metal and the consequent depreciation of the 
U||Persian currency. The usual rate of exchange when 
U||I was in Persia in 1884 was about 29 krans to the 
U||pound ; to-day it is 56. At this rate the revenue, which 
U||represented jf2,ooo,ooo in 1876, to-day only represents 
U||about ;£^i,5oo,ooo. Unless placed under foreign super- 
U||vision, as has been the case with the Customs, it cannot 
U||possibly, under the prevailing system, expand ; and so 
U||long as it is applied only to such futile, if not mis- 
U||chievous, purposes as the maintenance of a worthless 
U||army, the payment of a huge pension list which serves 
U||as a pretext for untold jobbery, and the expenses of a 
U||prodigal court, its expansion would be a very doubtful 
U||benefit. 
U||On the other hand, there has been of recent years 
U||a notable appreciation in the cost, not only of such 
U||imported goods as tea, sugar, cotton tissues, etc., which 
U||must be regarded as necessaries of life in Persia, but 
U||A BREAD ‘‘CORNER’* AT TEHERAN 
U||97 
U||also in that of foodstuffs and other staple commodities 
U||produced in the country. For imported goods the new 
U||tariff will still further increase this appreciation. The 
U||Persians, for instance, are a nation of tea-drinkers, but 
U||tea is not grown in Persia. Hitherto, under the old 
U||5 per cent, ad valorem tariff, the duty on imported tea 
U||was trifling. The specific duties under the new tariff 
U||work out to 170 per cent, ad valorem on the finer, and 
U||1 14 per cent, on the inferior, qualities, ue. that the cost 
U||of one of the commodities of almost universal consump- 
U||tion has been more than doubled. One would imagine 
U||that, at any rate, from the appreciation of foodstuffs 
U||grown in the country the people in general would have 
U||derived some benefit. But it does not appear to be so. 
U||Prices have to a great extent been manipulated for the 
U||exclusive benefit of powerful officials and large land- 
U||owners. Only a few years ago the Governor of Teheran 
U||and a ring of high-placed officials at Court engineered a 
U||‘^corner’* which drove bread up to famine prices until 
U||it affected the food supplies of the Cossack brigade, 
U||whereupon General Kosagowsky took the law practically 
U||into his own hands, and swept away the barriers which 
U||had been erected all round Teheran to prevent the 
U||ingress of foodstuffs to the markets of the capital. 
U||This was, however, only a more than usually glaring 
U||instance of official greed. Hardly a year passes in 
U||which there is not a famine in some province of Persia. 
U||There may be the most abundant crops in other pro- 
U||vinces, but owing to the absence of any proper means of 
U||communication, they cannot be transported, except at a 
U||prohibitive cost, into the famine-stricken region. Never- 
U||theless, the governors of the more favoured provinces, 
U||who would not lift a finger to relieve the famine if they 
U||could, make its existence an excuse for laying an 
U||H 
U||98 THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF PERSIA 
U||embargo on the exportation of grain from their own 
U||district, in order to buy it up at reduced prices for their 
U||own account with a view to future speculation. The 
U||burden of all these sins of omission and commission 
U||falls heavily upon the common people, for whom the 
U||cost of living, at Teheran at any rate, is stated to have 
U||doubled during the last twenty years. During the 
U||same period the balance of trade has increased steadily 
U||against Persia, and, according to the returns shown by 
U||the new Belgian Administration of Customs for 1901-2, 
U||the imports amounted to just about ;^5,ooo,ooo, while 
U||the exports fell short of ;£*3,ooo,ooo. These figures may 
U||not be altogether trustworthy, and in some respects they 
U||are even obviously misleading, as they take no account 
U||of the irregular trade along the land frontiers and in 
U||the Gulf which escapes the Customs, or of the constant 
U||and mysterious flow of Persian silver across the north- 
U||eastern frontiers into Central Asia and Afghanistan. 
U||But they also do not take into account the importation 
U||of silver bullion for the mint. As a mere approximate 
U||estimate these figures probably suffice to show roughly 
U||how far the value of Persian exports falls short of that 
U||of Persian imports. Yet Persia has to meet the 
U||deficiency somehow, and in her case, at any rate, there 
U||can be no question of ‘‘invisible exports ’’ in the shape 
U||of foreign investments, profit on freights, etc., to re- 
U||dress the balance. On the contrary, she has become 
U||during the last few years a debtor state with relatively 
U||very heavy liabilities. There is, therefore, only too 
U||much reason to believe that she has met increasing 
U||deficits, at first by the simple process of drawing upon 
U||the savings accumulated during the earlier part of the 
U||last reign, which was a period of peace and relative 
U||prosperity, and of late by the still more simple process 
U||ON THE ROAD TO RUIN 
U||99 
U||of borrowing with both hands. It is impossible that, 
U||in a country governed like Persia, the impoverishment 
U||of the people should not go hand-in-hand with the 
U||impoverishment of the Court and the bureaucracy, for 
U||whose benefit the people exist; and, though high- 
U||placed individuals may have waxed fat, there can be 
U||no doubt that the State as a whole — Court, bureaucracy, 
U||and people — is being rapidly reduced to penury. 
U||CHAPTER X 
U||POPULAR DISCONTENT IN PERSIA 
U||T he extent to which the process of national im- 
U||poverishment I have just described has affected 
U||the people of Persia can only be surmised indirectly 
U||from incidental manifestations of distress, but the 
U||desperate shifts to which the Court has been reduced 
U||in order to gratify its growing extravagance, bear abun- 
U||dant evidence to the penury of the State as a whole. 
U||The story is a simple one. It is, in fact, nothing but 
U||the old story of the rake’s progress. 
U||The late Shah Nasr-ed-Din had not only many of 
U||the qualities which go to make a strong monarch, but 
U||he practised steadfastly for many years the saving 
U||virtue of economy. He came to the throne in 1848, at 
U||the age of seventeen, and, judged by Persian standards, 
U||he showed himself, as he matured in years, a wise and 
U||firm ruler, and secured something like order and tran- 
U||quillity throughout his dominions. Favoured by the 
U||economic conditions of trade which prevailed at the 
U||time in the outside world, the people of Persia enjoyed 
U||a fair measure of prosperity. Of that prosperity Nasr- 
U||ed-Din naturally took ample tithes for himself, and, 
U||being of a frugal disposition, he increased and hoarded 
U||his wealth after the fashion of Oriental sovereigns. 
U||Large amounts of specie, costly jewels, and uncut 
U||100 
U||HIS MAJESTY THE SHAH 
U||lOI 
U||stones, gold plate and matchless objets de DertzL were 
U||accumulated in the vaults of the palace. The value of 
U||Nasr-ed-Din’s treasure was at one time estimated by 
U||sober authorities at ;£'4, 000,000, and that was probably 
U||no excessive estimate. During the last ten years of his 
U||reign, however, his old habits of economy seem to have 
U||deserted him, and as, owing to the fall in the price of 
U||silver and other untoward circumstances, the prosperity 
U||of the country began at the same time to wane, not only 
U||did he cease to add to his reserves, but he began to 
U||draw upon them with unaccustomed prodigality. Thus 
U||it came to pass that, when his life was brought to an 
U||untimely end, in 1896, his son, Muzaffer-ed-Din, found 
U||his inheritance had fallen very far short of his anticipa- 
U||tions. The succession to the throne always involves 
U||heavy expenditure. Muzaffer-ed-Din, who had held, 
U||as Vali-Ahd, his own miniature court at Tabriz, and 
U||surrounded himself with his own followers, chiefly 
U||drawn from the province of Azerbaijan, had not only to 
U||reward on the usual scale the services rendered to him 
U||whilst he was Heir- Apparent, but also had to propitiate 
U||his father’s entourage^ whose powerful influence was 
U||indispensable to a peaceful transfer of the supreme 
U||authority. By the time his Majesty had transferred his 
U||Court from Tabriz to Teheran and seated himself 
U||securely on the throne, the remnants of Nasr-ed-Din’s 
U||wealth were nearly dissipated. According to all 
U||accounts, Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah is a man of a kindly 
U||and easy-going disposition, full of amiable intentions, 
U||and by no means wanting in ability, indulgent to others 
U||if also addicted to gross self-indulgence. But he is 
U||weak and timorous, except in the matter of expenditure, 
U||where he is lavish to a degree, and absolutely undis- 
U||criminating in the objects of his munificence. Money 
U||102 
U||POPULAR DISCONTENT IN PERSIA 
U||flows like water through his fingers, and after waiting 
U||so many years for his inheritance, he was determined to 
U||deal with it, now that he had at last entered upon it, on 
U||the scale not of its meagre reality, but of the abundance 
U||he had fondly ascribed to it in his daydreams at Tabriz, 
U||The last of the ancient gold ingots bearing the cipher 
U||of Path Ali Shah and, I believe, most of the jewels and 
U||other treasures which did not constitute an indispensable 
U||part of the regalia for exhibition on state occasions, 
U||were disposed of through discreet channels in the 
U||European markets, and principally in Russia, Then, 
U||for a time, retrenchment, taking the usual form of 
U||deferred payments, in regard to all expenditure which 
U||did not immediately affect the Court, and the enhanced 
U||offerings of loyal officials anxious to ingratiate them- 
U||selves with the new sovereign, staved off the day of 
U||reckoning. But at last the moment came when these 
U||precarious devices could no longer be practised without 
U||danger of serious discontent at home. There is a limit 
U||to the patience of even Persian soldiers in the matter of 
U||deferred payments, and a Persian sovereign fresh to 
U||the throne cannot afford to suspend indefinitely the 
U||gentle flow of largess which is required to irrigate the 
U||parched soil of official loyalty. 
U||It was then that for the first time the credit of the 
U||country was pledged abroad to meet the requirements 
U||of the Court, and pledged not on business lines to 
U||private capitalists, but to a foreign Power whose 
U||political ambitions already cast their shadow over 
U||Persia. About four millions sterling nominally have 
U||flowed into the Persian Treasury in little more than 
U||three years, through the channel of the Banque 
U||d Escompte acting as the agent of the Russian 
U||Ministry of Finance, and, after allowance for all 
U||A ROYAL SPENDTHRIFT 
U||103 
U||necessary deductions, the sums placed at the unfettered 
U||disposal of the Shah as the proceeds of the Russian 
U||loans must have amounted to at least two millions net, 
U||Russia knows how to ingratiate herself with Eastern 
U||potentates, and whilst we should have used our in- 
U||fluence at Teheran, had we become creditors of Persia, 
U||to press for reforms and to exercise some sort of control 
U||over the expenditure to which such large sums were 
U||devoted, she has shown a discreet indifference as to 
U||the purposes to which they were applied, and kept her 
U||eye solely on the security which guarantees her invest- 
U||ment, and on the political advantages she can reap 
U||from it. The result is that not only has every penny 
U||of these two millions been spent without the slightest 
U||tangible benefit to the country, but the unrestrained 
U||facility with which the money has been borrowed and 
U||spent has confirmed the Shah in his natural propensity 
U||to wasteful extravagance. To our ears two or three 
U||millions sterling may not sound a very formidable sum, 
U||but in Persia it means that the State is now spending, 
U||for the sole benefit of the Court, at the rate of nearly 
U||twice its normal revenue, and this when, in the usual 
U||course of things, an enormous proportion of the normal 
U||revenue already goes to the support of the Court. 
U||What the Shah has actually spent all this money on 
U||it is difficult to say, and perhaps best not to inquire. 
U||English ears may be less prudish than they used to be, 
U||but the vices of Oriental courts are not yet a fit subject 
U||for public discussion, least of all those which prevail, 
U||according to the chronique scandaleuse of Teheran, at 
U||the Court of Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah, Unworthy as many 
U||of the objects of the Shah’s domestic munificence are, 
U||it would have been well for his popularity had he at 
U||least spent the money in his own country. What his 
U||104 
U||POPULAR DISCONTENT IN PERSIA 
U||people most bitterly resent are the large sums he expends 
U||out of the country in the course of his European travels. 
U||Popular imagination is no doubt prone to exaggerate, 
U||but the cost of his Majesty’s two journeys to Europe 
U||since his accession must, I am assured, be reckoned in 
U||hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the Persians 
U||not unnaturally look with disfavour upon the growth of 
U||such unfamiliar and costly tastes. It is not so many 
U||years ago that a Teheran newspaper — for there are two 
U||or three newspapers printed in Persia, of a strictly 
U||semi-official character — boasted that whatever might 
U||be the shortcomings of Persia, she had no national 
U||debt,' and none of the resources of the country were 
U||pledged, none of its revenues mortgaged to foreign 
U||creditors. What has become of that proud boast to- 
U||day? Is it surprising that the Persians should look 
U||askance at the importation of financial methods which 
U||graft on to the old abuses, to which long familiarity 
U||has reconciled them, a fresh growth of abuses clothed 
U||in a novel and foreign garb? The story of these new 
U||loans, about which no official information has ever been 
U||vouchsafed, loses nothing in the telling as it circulates 
U||through the bazaars of the capital and filters down 
U||from caravanserai to caravanserai into the remotest 
U||provinces, and the people ask themselves what is the 
U||meaning of these mysterious operations by which the 
U||revenues of the country are being signed away, whilst 
U||for the millions of krans they are supposed to produce 
U||not a road or a bridge has been built, not a caravan- 
U||serai has been repaired, not a canal has been dug to 
U||bring water to the vast tracts of fertile land which the 
U||want of irrigation alone condemns to remain wastes of 
U||arid desert. There are in many quarters signs of grave 
U||popular discontent, not the least significant among 
U||THE ATABEG-AZAM 
U||105 
U||them being a great revival of Babiism ; and what makes 
U||these manifestations of disaffection the more ominous 
U||is that the disaffection arises out of entirely novel 
U||developments in the misgovernment of the country, 
U||for a remedy to which its past history affords no pre- 
U||cedent. 
U||When I was at Teheran a year ago, popular resent- 
U||ment appeared to be directed not so much against the 
U||Shah, who, not being reputed a strong man, enjoys but 
U||little of his father’s prestige, as against his powerful 
U||Prime Minister, the Atabeg-Azam. That the latter, 
U||however unscrupulous he may be, is in many respects 
U||the ablest man in the country is readily conceded, even 
U||by those who have the least liking for him. He then 
U||possessed, as far as it was possible to judge, the full 
U||and undivided confidence of his master, and what was 
U||perhaps even more important, the generous support of 
U||Russia, whose liberality to those who serve her is un- 
U||stinted. His bright and genial manner, his ready wit, 
U||and his intellectual powers cannot but make a favour- 
U||able impression upon all those who approach him, and 
U||amongst foreigners generally, whatever they might 
U||think of his policy, it was admitted that it would be 
U||difficult, even if it were desirable, to replace him. 
U||Yet, on the other hand, it was he who was, with 
U||good reason, held largely responsible for the reckless 
U||course of extravagance upon which the Shah has 
U||embarked, and for the heavy indebtedness into which 
U||an impoverished country is being dragged. His 
U||position, great as it still was, was, as that of every 
U||favourite Minister must always be, one of constant 
U||difficulty. The first duty of a Persian Grand Vizier 
U||is to minister to the financial necessities of his master, 
U||and on this point, though the present Shah may not 
U||io6 POPULAR DISCONTENT IN PERSIA 
U||be a strong man, he is clearly not less exacting than 
U||any of his predecessors. Another and scarcely less 
U||important duty of the Grand Vizier is to maintain 
U||order throughout the Shah’s dominions. In this 
U||respect the Atabeg-Azam has not been, for some 
U||time past, altogether fortunate. In addition to the 
U||chronic turbulence of the less settled parts of the 
U||country, such as Luristan, there have been serious dis- 
U||turbances this year in most of the large cities, partly 
U||due to the discontent caused by the new Customs tariff 
U||and the consequent depression of trade, and partly to 
U||more general causes of disaffection. These disturb- 
U||ances were repressed for the time being by the usual 
U||methods, but the moment was bound to come when it 
U||would be hard for the Atabeg-Azam to fulfil both his 
U||duties with equal success, and he had already once 
U||before learnt from bitter experience that in Teheran the 
U||Tarpeian rock is very near to the Capitol. Powerful 
U||as he has been during his second tenure of office, his 
U||power was probably never quite so assured as it 
U||seemed to be when he was suddenly hurled from 
U||office in 1897, and his life was believed to be in such 
U||imminent jeopardy that the British Minister deemed 
U||it expedient to take measures for protecting him during 
U||his journey to his place of exile at Kum, by allowing 
U||the physician of the Legation to accompany him — a 
U||service which he requited on his return to power by 
U||working tooth and nail, and ultimately with success, 
U||to procure Sir Mortimer Durand’s transfer to another 
U||post. That the Atabeg was recalled to office within 
U||eighteen months, and loaded afterwards with still higher 
U||honours, afforded no permanent guarantee that history 
U||might not repeat itself in his case. 
U||Apart from the support which he derived from Russian 
U||KUM AND THE GOLDEN MOSQUE OF FATIMA (p. 133) 
U||THE AMIN-ED-DOWLEH 
U||107 
U||influence, and which was, of course, conditional upon his 
U||subserviency to Russian policy, the Atabeg’s strength 
U||lay mainly in the absence of any serious competitor. 
U||His chief rival was supposed to be the Amin-ed-Dowleh, 
U||who succeeded the Atabeg after the latter’s fall in 1897. 
U||Great hopes were founded upon his accession to oiBfice, 
U||as he had had considerable experience of state affairs, 
U||and was believed to be a man of enlightened views and 
U||honesty of purpose, as well as of undoubted intelli- 
U||gence. He did, indeed, prepare a fairly practical 
U||scheme of administrative reform. He proposed to draw 
U||up a regular budget, which should set forth the actual 
U||revenue and expenditure of the country, and he laid 
U||great stress upon the necessity of separate administra- 
U||tion for the collection and for the expenditure of revenue. 
U||A revision of the assessment of the land tax, perhaps 
U||the most crying need of the country, was one of the 
U||main features of his programme, which included a 
U||reduction of the standing army to 20,000 effectives, 
U||and the organisation of the irregular cavalry into a 
U||disciplined body of gendarmerie. But excellent as were 
U||his intentions, he had not the force of purpose to carry 
U||them through, and his programme, like many other 
U||similar programmes in Persia, was practically pigeon- 
U||holed, even before he, in turn, fell as suddenly from 
U||power, in the spring of 1898, as had the Atabeg, who 
U||was once more to succeed him. Some of the Amin-ed- 
U||Dowleh’s ideas have, however, been carried out through 
U||other agencies, such as the reform of the smaller cur- 
U||rency by the introduction of nickel coinage ; and a few 
U||of the schools which he opened by appealing to private 
U||enterprise, himself setting the example of liberal sub- 
U||scriptions and donations, still subsist. The Amin-ed- 
U||Dowleh was sent to live in compulsory retirement on 
U||io8 POPULAR DISCONTENT IN PERSIA 
U||his own property near Resht. Another and perhaps 
U||the most formidable of the Atabeg’s rivals was believed 
U||to be the Firman-Firma, now in exile at Baghdad. 
U||He is a great-grandson of Fath Ali Shah, and 
U||brother of the chief wife, and at the same time 
U||son-in-law, of the present Shah. He has filled in 
U||turn many high offices, and is credited with the 
U||principal share in the Atabeg’s downfall in 1897. 
U||Others whom the Atabeg deemed it prudent to have 
U||removed from the vicinity of the Court were the 
U||Kawam-ed-Dowleh, banished to Meshed, for many 
U||years member of the Council of State, and connected 
U||by marriage with the Shah; the Nassir-el-Mulk, in 
U||honourable exile as Governor of Kurdistan, who was 
U||a fellow-student at Balliol both of Lord Curzon and of 
U||the present British Minister at Teheran, Sir Arthur 
U||Hardinge, and was sent on a special mission to London 
U||to announce the accession of Muzaffer-ed-Din ; and the 
U||Ala-el-Mulk, now Governor of Kerman, a Seyyid or 
U||descendant of the Prophet, who comes of an influential 
U||family, and has occupied important diplomatic posts at 
U||St, Petersburg and Constantinople. The last-named 
U||especially has the reputation of being a strong man, 
U||with independent and progressive views. Other enemies 
U||the Atabeg still had nearer to Court, and though he 
U||again lately procured the removal of a good many 
U||“suspects,’’ amongst others of the Hakim-el-Mulk, 
U||the most masterful Minister could never hope to 
U||eliminate all his would-be rivals. 
U||But though, like most Oriental courts, that of Teheran 
U||is a hot-bed of ceaseless intrigue, the Atabeg had per- 
U||haps less to fear in that direction than from the growth 
U||of popular discontent outside. Public opinion, in the 
U||sense in which we understand it, can hardly be said to 
U||THE HEIR-APPARENT 
U||109 
U||exist in Persia, but there is an influential class whose 
U||voice, though no longer so powerful as in the past, 
U||may still sway the masses at a critical moment. In no 
U||Mussulman country is scepticism so prevalent and 
U||even fashionable as in Persia, but the religious teachers 
U||of the Faith have not yet entirely lost their hold upon 
U||the people, and in a Shia country the ecclesiastical 
U||authority is not so closely bound up with the secular 
U||authority as in Sunni countries. The moral standard 
U||of the Persian Mullahs may not be of the highest, and 
U||they are indeed by no means free from the prevailing 
U||vices of the official classes ; but in the absence of 
U||any independent aristocracy of birth, or of any in- 
U||fluential middle class, it is they alone who can in 
U||some measure stand, and have at times stood, be- 
U||tween the people and its rulers. With few masterful 
U||exceptions, such as Nadir Shah, most sovereigns and 
U||ministers have come to the conclusion that it is politic 
U||to conciliate them, and both Muzaffer-ed-Din and the 
U||Atabeg-Azam have been careful to deal kindly with 
U||them. But the cry that the country is being sold to 
U||the foreigner is one which, if once raised — and it is a 
U||cry that naturally appeals to the more fanatical section 
U||of the Mullahs — it is very difficult, even for so resource- 
U||ful a minister as was the Atabeg, to quell. At first 
U||it may not go beyond a whisper or a muttering, but 
U||even a whisper or a muttering ultimately reaches the 
U||ear of the sovereign, and then the consequences are 
U||apt to be ugly ; for Muzafifer-ed-Din is not the man 
U||who would stand by a favourite Minister at any risk 
U||to himself. His eldest son, now the Veli Ahd, lives, 
U||as the Shah did until his accession, at Tabriz. Lacking 
U||some of his father's more amiable weaknesses, he is 
U||credited with imperious and impatient ambitions, and 
U||no POPULAR DISCONTENT IN PERSIA 
U||he courts with equal assiduity the goodwill both of the 
U||Mullahs and of the Russians. 
U||Seldom, even in the annals of an Oriental court, has an 
U||apparently all-powerful minister fallen in more dramatic 
U||circumstances than those which attended the Atabeg’s 
U||recent dismissal. At the beginning of September, 1903, 
U||the news of the death of the Hakim-el-Mulk at Resht 
U||produced a profound sensation in Teheran. The Hakim- 
U||el-Mulk had long been one of the most confidential 
U||servants and advisers of the present Shah. A pupil 
U||of Dr. Tholozan, the distinguished French physician 
U||of the late Shah, the Hakim-el-Mulk was appointed in 
U||the same capacity to the Court of the present Shah, 
U||whilst the latter was still Heir-Apparent and resided at 
U||Tabriz. He accompanied Muzaffer-ed-Din to Teheran 
U||after Nasr-ed-Din’s death, and at the beginning of 1900 
U||he was promoted to the position of Wazir-i-Durbar, 
U||or First Chamberlain of the Court — z. position which 
U||gave him a rank second only to that of the Atabeg- 
U||Azam himself. A few months later he travelled with 
U||the Shah to Europe, and until the spring of this year 
U||remained constantly in personal attendance upon the 
U||Sovereign. He had great wealth and many friends, 
U||and though he was himself a prudent man, and was 
U||careful to keep discreetly in the background, some of 
U||his clients were less cautious, and are said to have 
U||used his name and influence rather too freely in opposi- 
U||tion to the Atabeg. In May the Hakim-el-Mulk was 
U||banished to Resht, nominally as Governor, and this 
U||was regarded as further evidence of the Atabeg’s omni- 
U||potence. But Resht is, after all, not very far from 
U||Teheran. At any rate, it was not far enough to disarm 
U||the apprehensions of the Atabeg or of those who were 
U||anxious to take credit to themselves for interpreting 
U||THE FALL OF THE ATABEG 
U||III 
U||his secret thoughts. Early in September the Hakim- 
U||el-Mulk and his confidential servant died suddenly 
U||within a few hours in very suspicious circumstances. 
U||Within a fortnight the Atabeg-Azam himself was 
U||dismissed from all his offices and banished, not merely 
U||from the capital, but from the Shah’s dominion. In 
U||what precise relation his fall stands to the mysterious 
U||death of the Hakim-el-Mulk we shall probably never 
U||know. It may be that the tragic end of so old and 
U||long-trusted a servant as the Hakim aroused the Shah’s 
U||wrath or awakened other suspicions. The Atabeg- 
U||Azam was, no doubt, ‘^a man 
U||Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking* 
U||Himself with princes,” 
U||and there are some shrewd observers who long ago 
U||suspected that he might not always remain content 
U||merely to rank himself with princes, but would some 
U||day aspire to rank himself above them. The wide- 
U||spread disturbances which broke out in so many 
U||different parts of Persia during the first half of 1903 
U||had doubtless tended to weaken his position, and in 
U||spite of all he had done to earn the support of Russia, 
U||he had failed in some points to carry out her wishes, 
U||as, for instance, with regard to the Seistan Boundary 
U||Commission, over which she had hoped to exercise 
U||directly or indirectly a larger control, and also with 
U||regard to the Anglo-Persian Commercial Convention, 
U||which indeed ratified the fait accompli in favour of 
U||Russian diplomacy, but at any rate prevented the repe- 
U||tition of another such coup in the future. The causes, 
U||or some of the causes, which have brought about the 
U||Atabeg’s downfall can at present be merely surmised. 
U||That the crisis was no ordinary one may be gathered 
U||from the fact, almost, if not absolutely, unprecedented 
U||1 12 POPULAR DISCONTENT IN PERSIA 
U||in the history of the present dynasty, that a member 
U||of 'the Kajar family has now been appointed Prime 
U||Minister. The Ain-ed-Dowleh, hitherto Governor of 
U||Teheran,* is a grandson of Path Ali Shah, the great- 
U||grandfather of Muzaffer-ed-Din, and besides being 
U||thus a distant cousin of the reigning Shah, he is 
U||married to one of Muzaffer-ed-Din's sisters, and one 
U||of his own sisters was married to the late Shah. He 
U||is ambitious and masterful, and has long been known 
U||to resent the ascendency of the ex-Grand Vizier. 
U||But if one may judge him by his record as Governor 
U||of Teheran, he is hardly likely to lift the government 
U||of Persia out of the slough of despond into which it 
U||has sunk, whilst, as a member of the Kajar family, he 
U||might easily add most seriously to the discredit into 
U||which the dynasty has already fallen. In the meantime 
U||the usual chassez^roisez is going on at Teheran. Many 
U||of those who had incurred the Atabeg’s special dis- 
U||pleasure, like the Nassir-el-Mulk, the Kawam-ed- 
U||Dowleh, etc., have been recalled to the capital, whilst 
U||his chief supporters and favourites have been involved 
U||in his disgrace. The ex- Grand Vizier himself has 
U||departed into exile, avowedly on a prolonged pilgrimage 
U||to Mecca. This is a time-honoured expedient which 
U||helps to keep the luckless traveller’s head on his 
U||shoulders until he has passed the frontier. 
U||CHAPTER XI 
U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||T hat the movement which bears the apostolic 
U||name of the religious martyr who was put to 
U||death at Tabriz more than half a century* ago is still 
U||a living force in Persia is almost universally recog- 
U||nised. But to what extent and in what shape that force 
U||is likely to make itself decisively felt opinions differ 
U||very largely. Any survey, however brief, of the 
U||general condition of Persia would, however, be incom- 
U||plete without some attempt to define the present position 
U||of Babiism, as its origin and evolution appear to be 
U||exceptionally characteristic of an important phase of 
U||Persian life. 
U||Like the Hindu Aryans, Persian thinkers have at all 
U||times been distinguished for their passion for meta- 
U||physical inquiry coupled with inordinate imagination. 
U||They delight in abstract subtleties of thought and 
U||dialectical gymnastics, for the sake, it would seem, 
U||rather of the intellectual enjoyment which such exer- 
U||cises in themselves afford than in the hope of reaching 
U||any definite goal. Hence the impatience they have 
U||always shown of the restraints of cut - and - dried 
U||theology. Under the later kings of the Sassanide 
U||dynasty the priestly caste, though supported by the 
U||secular arm of the State, had been unable to maintain 
U||the authority of the Zoroastrian Church, which was 
U||II4 
U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||already completely undermined before the tide of Arab 
U||conquest swept over the country. The Semitic form of 
U||Islam imposed by the conquerors was only tolerated 
U||for a very short time. It succumbed to the Shia schism 
U||which represented a national reaction, intellectual and 
U||political as well as religious, though it nominally 
U||turned only on the superiority of Ali’s claims to the 
U||Khalifate as against those of the three first succes- 
U||sors of Mahomet. To preserve even the outward 
U||appearances of Shia uniformity it has been necessary 
U||to create in Persia, on lines not dissimilar to those 
U||of the old Zoroastrian priesthood, an ecclesiastical 
U||organisation which presents a closer analogy to an 
U||established church than is to be found elsewhere in the 
U||world of Islam. Even so, it is only an outward uni- 
U||formity that has been preserved. It has indeed been 
U||asserted that in the whole of Persia there is not a single 
U||Mussulman who believes in all the tenets of Shiitic 
U||Islam without any admixture of extraneous doctrines. 
U||Amongst the masses Islam is overlaid with gross 
U||superstitions, largely compounded of native hagiology 
U||quite alien to its original spirit of rigid monotheism. 
U||Amongst the bulk of the more educated classes it has 
U||been refined away into intellectual agnosticism, or has 
U||merged into materialistic pantheism. Islam survives as 
U||the badge of a conservative institution for the protec- 
U||tion of the vested interests of the ruling classes, as a 
U||war-cry for enlisting in their service the passions of 
U||popular superstitions, and also as a customary common 
U||denominator of heterogeneous schools of thought that 
U||accept its inherited forms and ceremonies, just as many 
U||Europeans continue to conform to the traditional 
U||practices of a Christian church long after they have 
U||rejected its dogmas, or ceased even to be influenced by 
U||PERSIAN SCEPTICISM 
U||its spirit. The result has been, on the one hand, a 
U||lapse into mere sensualism, on the other, a tendency 
U||towards extreme asceticism, and sometimes a curious 
U||combination of both — an intellectual delight in the 
U||philosophic conceptions that underlie the latter and a 
U||material delight in the pleasures that satisfy the former. 
U||May it not be that what appear to us the anarchical 
U||conditions of spiritual life in such a country as Persia 
U||are but the natural reflex of the anarchical conditions 
U||of material existence ? May not the spirit of scepticism 
U||and indifferentism which permeates the writings of the 
U||whole Sufi school of Persian poets and philosophers 
U||be largely due to the utter hopelessness of attempting 
U||to deduce any moral laws from the continuous vicissi- 
U||tudes which they experienced and witnessed in their 
U||own lives and in the lives of those around them ? The 
U||procession of dynasties and rulers wading through 
U||blood to power only to be hurled back again by the 
U||same brutal process into the obscurity from which had 
U||each in turn emerged, the interminable recurrence of 
U||internal strife and external invasion, with their in- 
U||evitable accompaniments of pestilence and famine, are 
U||apt merely to daze the European reader of Oriental 
U||chronicles. But what must have been the effect of 
U||such events upon those for whom they meant the 
U||ruin of their homes, the dispersion of their families, 
U||the loss of fortune, honours, possessions? Among 
U||Persian poets, none has preached the vanity of life 
U||in a form more attractive than Sadi, both to those 
U||who would seek compensation for it in the fullest 
U||measure of sensual enjoyment, and to those who, 
U||reading into his verses a symbolical meaning, would 
U||fain find in them an exhortation to the pursuit of 
U||spiritual emancipation from the thraldom of the senses. 
U||ii6 
U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||As one of the shrewdest students of the spiritual life 
U||of Persia, M. de Gobineau, has observed, when one has 
U||witnessed two or three times in his life the progress of 
U||a Tartar Prince on his way to the execution of a prede- 
U||cessor — Mongol, Turk, or Arab — who had done the 
U||same by someone else before him, and when one 
U||has himself suffered numberless vicissitudes in conse- 
U||quence of such events ; when one has been like Sadi 
U||a great personage, and then a common soldier, and 
U||then the prisoner of a Christian feudal chief ; when 
U||one has worked as a navvy on the fortifications of the 
U||Count of Antioch, and wandered back afoot to Shiraz 
U||after infinite pain and labour, he may well be disposed 
U||to think that nothing that exists is real or, at least, has 
U||any substantial reality worth clinging to. To-day the 
U||public peace of Persia is no longer subject to such 
U||violent perturbations. At least, as far as we are con- 
U||cerned, the appearances of peace prevail, and few of us 
U||care or have occasion to look beyond the appearances. 
U||But for the Persians themselves, have the conditions 
U||very much changed? Do they not witness one day the 
U||sudden rise of this or that favourite of fortune and the 
U||next day his equally sudden fall ? Have they not seen 
U||the Atabeg-Azam twice hold sway as the Shah’s all- 
U||powerful Vizier, and twice hurled down from that 
U||pinnacle by a bolt from the blue? How many other 
U||ministers and governors have sat for a time in the 
U||seats of the mighty and been swept away by some in- 
U||trigue as sordid as that to which they owed their own 
U||exaltation? And how many in humbler stations have 
U||been in the meantime the recipients of their unworthy 
U||favours or the victims of their arbitrary oppression? 
U||A village which but yesterday was fairly prosperous 
U||is beggared to-day by some neighbouring landlord

U||THE “MANIFESTATION” 117 
U||higher up the valley, who, having duly propitiated 
U||those in authority, diverts for the benefit of his own 
U||estates the whole of its slender supply of water. The 
U||progress of a governor or royal prince, with all his 
U||customary retinue of ravenous hangers-on, eats out the 
U||countryside through which it passes more effectually 
U||than a flight of locusts. The visitation is as ruinous 
U||and as unaccountable. Is it not the absence of all 
U||visible moral correlation of cause and effect in these 
U||phenomena of daily life that has gone far to produce 
U||the stolid fatalism of the masses, the scoffing scepticism 
U||of the more educated classes, and from time to time the 
U||revolt of some nobler minds? Of such the most recent 
U||and perhaps the noblest of all became the founder of 
U||Babiism. 
U||The story of Mirza Ali Muhammed, better known as 
U||the Bah, or gate through whom the new knowledge of a 
U||better life was to be attained, scarcely requires repeti- 
U||tion. He was born in 1819 or 1820 at Shiraz, and 
U||acquired at an early age a great reputation for his 
U||learning in metaphysics and theology and for the purity 
U||and austerity of his life. A pilgrimage to Mecca and 
U||to the Shia shrines of Kerbela only served to complete 
U||his estrangement from Persian orthodoxy. On his 
U||return to Persia he began to preach openly against the 
U||corruption and vices of the clergy, and still professing 
U||the greatest veneration for the Prophet, used his Koran 
U||chiefly to justify his denunciations of the degenerate 
U||professors of the sacred book. Gradually, and in more 
U||secret conferences, he began to expound a new gospel, 
U||which was an implied, if not an explicit, negation 
U||of Islam. At the date of his “ Manifestation,” when he 
U||proclaimed himself to be “the Bab,” in 1844, was 
U||barely twenty-five years of age. Yet not only in his 
U||ii8 
U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||own native town of Shiraz, but all over the South 
U||of Persia, he had recruited disciples amongst men 
U||of every age and rank and class. Some — ^and not the 
U||least influential — were ready to carry his message into 
U||the North, and it was through their agency that the 
U||new movement assumed the political character which 
U||precipitated the catastrophe. He himself remained 
U||throughout, both in his speeches and in his writings, 
U||essentially a religious agitator, though his claims to 
U||divine revelation and even to be regarded as an incarna- 
U||tion of the deity grew more and more outspoken and 
U||imperious. At Court and in the official bureaucracy, 
U||at any rate until the death of Muhammed Shah in 
U||1848, there were many whose intellectual curiosity of 
U||metaphysical novelties inclined them to disregard the 
U||denunciations which poured in from the clergy of the 
U||revolutionary tendencies of the Bab’s teachings, and at 
U||one moment the eccentric Grand Vizier, Hajji Mirza 
U||Aghassy, who had a mania for theological disputations, 
U||had nearly induced his master to invite the Bab to 
U||Teheran to meet in public conference the chief pundits 
U||of orthodoxy. But in the northern provinces, especially 
U||in Khorasan, in Mazenderan, and in Azerbaijan, the 
U||Babiist movement was destined rapidly to assume a 
U||character which could not but alarm the ruling classes. 
U||Perhaps it was the different temperament of the disciples 
U||who had undertaken to spread the new doctrine, or 
U||of the people to whom they preached ; perhaps it was 
U||a chapter of accidents more difficult to account for. 
U||Anyhow, in the North the message of peace was soon 
U||converted into a message of war ; and when Nasr-ed-Din 
U||Shah came to the throne he found the provinces nearest 
U||to his capital torn by sectarian strife. The military 
U||forces of the State were called into requisition, and 
U||DEAT’H OF THE BAB 
U||119 
U||despite prodigies ofiHndi-^idiial valour, and many brilliant 
U||feats of arms, the Baabisswere overwhelmed successively 
U||in their two chief str-on^holds, a cold-blooded massacre 
U||in defiance of the plligfcoted word of royal princes com- 
U||pleting in both cases aft 'erthe surrender of the survivors 
U||the restoration of thne SShah’s authority. But though 
U||the militant forces of BBabiism had been crushed, the 
U||spirit which informed : it was still unconquered. The 
U||fervour of its neopUiyUes in the large cities had not 
U||broken out into deeds of violence, but by the light 
U||of what had already hagppesned elsewhere, the teachings 
U||of the Bab, though mot i in themselves actually seditious, 
U||could no longer be regarded merely as an interesting 
U||subject of metaphyssicaBl speculation. The Bab, who 
U||had at first been placed un der arrest in Shiraz and then 
U||conveyed in safe cmistcDdy into the Caspian province 
U||of Ghilan, was riow~ se snt in chains to Tabriz, where, 
U||after being treated v^vithn e'very refinement of ignominy 
U||and cruelty, he was firmally put to death on July 9th, 
U||1850, together with ome chosen companion who was 
U||faithful unto him too tKie end. When it was at last 
U||decided to take hisli fe, he was led out to be shot in the 
U||public square outsicfle t';le citadel, and the first volley 
U||left him unhurt. H^d bne t mmediately taken advantage 
U||of the impression, m adesupon the crowd of spectators, 
U||who had assembled vwithD mingled feelings to witness his 
U||execution and were p:rob«abLy just as ready to acclaim him 
U||as a prophet in wlios efaevoxir God Himself had wrought 
U||a miracle as to jeerr att his ignoble death, the whole 
U||course of Persian h istoory might have been changed. 
U||But he was dazed annd esxha.usted by his sufferings, and 
U||he fled blindly back inter) the citadel, where, in a guard- 
U||house in which he haad sought refuge, the soldiers

U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||The Bab was dead, but not Babiism. He was not the 
U||first, and still less the last, of a long line of martyrs 
U||who have testified that, even in a country gangrened 
U||with corruption and atrophied with indifferentism like 
U||Persia, the soul of a nation survives, inarticulate, 
U||perhaps, and in a way helpless, but still capable of 
U||sudden spasms of vitality. Was the Bab himself the 
U||creator of the movement which bears his name, or was 
U||he merely the exponent of ideas and sentiments which 
U||would have ripened even without him into maturity? 
U||It is the old question as to whether great men are only 
U||the fated product of an age in travail, or whether their 
U||genius fashions into a new shape the world in which 
U||they live and move and have their being. Certainly as 
U||far as the Bab is concerned, his personal activity hardly 
U||seems to account for the evolution of Babiism either 
U||during his own lifetime or since his death. Still less 
U||does the personal activity of his successors account for 
U||it. The execution of the Bab was followed by a period 
U||of wholesale persecution for his disciples throughout 
U||Persia, which culminated, in 1852, after a Babi attempt 
U||on the Shah’s life, in an orgy of torture and bloodshed 
U||at Teheran when the Seven Martyrs and many others, 
U||including women and children, met their terrible fate 
U||with heroic fortitude. By this time almost all the 
U||leading adepts of the new religion had been destroyed, 
U||and the Bab’s successor was compelled to seek refuge 
U||in exile at Baghdad. Mirza Yahya, upon whom the 
U||Bab’s mantle was held to have descended, was a mere 
U||youth, only sixteen years of age, the son of a great 
U||personage who had been Governor of Teheran, but 
U||brought up, after his mother’s death when he was still 
U||an infant, by the wife of one of the chief apostles of the 
U||Bab. Some say that a secret message from the Bab, 
U||THE BAB’S SUCCESSORS 
U||I2I 
U||delivered after his execution, designated Mirza Yahya 
U||as his successor, others that he was chosen by a con- 
U||clave of disciples on the strength of certain mysterious 
U||indications of peculiar moral fitness. Though he bore 
U||the title of Subh-i-Ezel, or Dawn of Eternity, in analogy 
U||to the title of Hazret-i-Ala or Supreme Highness, 
U||which the Bab had taken during the last years of his 
U||life, the part he played in the subsequent history of 
U||Babiism seems to have been inconspicuous. A half- 
U||brother of Mirza Yahya, Mirza Hussein Ali, thirteen 
U||years his senior, who had been imprisoned at Teheran 
U||on suspicion of complicity in the attempted assassina- 
U||tion of the Shah, rejoined him at Baghdad, and soon 
U||practically usurped his authority, though nominally 
U||yielding him religious allegiance. Dissensions were 
U||rife at this period amongst the Babis, and the Persian 
U||pilgrims of Babi proclivity, who on their way to Kerbela 
U||used to visit the two brothers at Baghdad, were apt to 
U||fight over their respective claims to spiritual supremacy. 
U||The Persian Government ultimately urged the Porte to 
U||remove them both to some part of the Turkish Empire 
U||less frequented by Persians. In 1864 they were trans- 
U||ferred to Constantinople and then to Adrianople. Here 
U||Mirza Hussein Ali, who had taken the title of Beha - 
U||ullah, or ‘‘Splendour of God,” openly claimed to be 
U||“ He who was to be made manifest,” whose advent the 
U||Bab himself had foretold. This claim, of course, 
U||involved the supersession of the Subh-i-Ezel, who had 
U||never been regarded as more than the successor or 
U||vicegerent of the Bab. Most of the Babis who had 
U||accompanied the two brothers in their exile went over 
U||to Beha’ullah’s side, but those who still came on 
U||pilgrimage from Persia did not so readily acquiesce in 
U||his claims, and serious disturbances from time to time 
U||122 
U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||occurred between the two factions. Finally the Porte 
U||decided to separate the two brothers. In 1868 Subh-i- 
U||Ezel and his few remaining adherents were sent to 
U||Cyprus, where they still reside, and Beha'ullah with his 
U||party was sent to Acre. From this moment Subh-i- 
U||EzeFs influence, such as it had been, ceased altogether. 
U||Beha’ullah not only became the recognised head of 
U||Babiism, but he composed voluminous scriptures, which 
U||gradually superseded the writings of the Bab himself, 
U||and he claimed even more emphatically than the Bab to 
U||be revered as a divine incarnation. Pilgrims from Persia 
U||flocked at one time to the modest court he held in Acre, 
U||and he used occasionally to receive a few privileged 
U||European visitors, such as Professor Browne, of Oxford, 
U||the chief English authority on Babiism, and the late 
U||Laurence Oliphant, who, from his latter-day retreat on 
U||Mount Carmel, used to keep up friendly relations with 
U||the leaders of a movement in which, as in all religious 
U||speculations, he was deeply interested. It was as 
U||Oliphant’s guest that in 1885 I enjoyed the favour of 
U||Beha’ullah’s hospitality, and under the s'kme auspices 
U||were entertained by him a party of Americans in search 
U||of new spiritual truths, from whose visit, and more 
U||directly from the preachings of a Babi missionary, 
U||Ibrahim Khairullah, who lectured in America, there 
U||has sprung up an American branch of the Babi Church, 
U||which counts, it is said, some 4,000 adherents, chiefly 
U||in Chicago. 
U||Beha’ullah died in 1892, and his eldest son, Abbas 
U||Effendi, maintains the succession at Acre, though his 
U||authority has been disputed by a younger brother. 
U||How far the influence of Acre continues to make itself 
U||felt amongst the Babis generally, it is hard to say. 
U||Regular communication is kept up between Persia and 
U||EVERY FIFTH PERSIAN A BABI 
U||123 
U||Acre, both by pilgrimages and confidential messengers ; 
U||and the sacred books of Beha’ullah and Abbas Effendi 
U||are widely read by the Babi communities. That the 
U||latter are still very numerous and spread throughout 
U||the length and breadth of Persia there can be no 
U||doubt. In all the large cities, in Shiraz and Yezd, in 
U||Isfahan and Tabriz, and even in the capital, their 
U||adherents are to be found amongst all classes of the 
U||population, amongst officials and soldiers, amongst 
U||merchants and artisans, as well as amongst the 
U||humblest of the people. Amongst the rural popula- 
U||tion also, and especially in the villages around Isfahan, 
U||Kum, and Kashan, and throughout Khorasan, they 
U||have a large following. Their total strength is esti- 
U||mated by competent authorities at nearly one and a 
U||half millions, or about 20 per cent, of the total popula- 
U||tion of Persia. But all such estimates must be largely 
U||guesswork, as the most convinced Babis cannot make 
U||any open profession of their faith ; and it is difficult to 
U||distinguish between those who have fully accepted the 
U||religious teachings of Babiism and those who merely 
U||sympathise with its reforming tendencies. Though 
U||there has been no general proscription of Babis by the 
U||State since 1852, the hostility of the orthodox clergy 
U||towards them has never relented, and they have been 
U||constantly liable, not only to savage outbreaks of 
U||popular fanaticism, as in Yezd in 1891, and again this 
U||year in many places, but to the fitful vindictiveness of 
U||the authorities as in Isfahan, where in 1878, and again 
U||in 1888, fresh names were added to their long roll of 
U||martyrs. The aggravated misrule of the last few years, 
U||with its premonitions of impending national disintegra- 
U||tion, has unquestionably brought vast numbers of 
U||recruits to their ranks. They maintain, indeed, that 
U||124 
U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||their objects are not in any way political, and quote the 
U||warning issued by the Subh-i-Ezel after the Bab’s death, 
U||that the fight must be fought with spiritual and not with 
U||material weapons, as well as Beha’ullah’s injunction 
U||that it is better to be killed than to kilL The pre- 
U||dominant tendency at the present day is in fact to give 
U||prominence to the ethical rather than to the theological 
U||aspect of Babiism, and from the latter point of view, to 
U||dwell upon the essential truths which underlie all 
U||‘‘manifestations” of divine origin rather than on the 
U||outward forms which differentiate them. The new dis- 
U||pensation should therefore, it is claimed, be regarded 
U||chiefly as the continuation and fulfilment of the earlier 
U||Mosaic, Christian, and Muhammedan dispensations. 
U||Does not the Jew still wait for the promised Messiah, 
U||the Christian for the second advent of Christ, the 
U||Mussulman for the appearance of a Mahdi? Babiism 
U||is but the “manifestation ” they are all equally expect- 
U||ing, and the evolution it has undergone, even within 
U||the short period since the Bab gave his first message 
U||to the world, precludes any claim to rigid doctrinal 
U||finality. The Babis certainly profess, and within the 
U||measure of their limited opportunities, have practised 
U||tolerance and good will towards all, Christians and Jews, 
U||Sufis and Zoroastrians, and they talk with enthusiasm 
U||of the universal brotherhood of man and a millennium 
U||in which wars and civil strife shall cease. 
U||Socially one of the most interesting features of 
U||Babiism is the raising of women to a much higher 
U||plane than she is usually admitted to in the East. The 
U||Bab himself had no more devoted a disciple than the 
U||beautiful and gifted lady, known as Kurrat-el-Ain, the 
U||“Consolation of the Eyes,” who, having shared all 
U||the dangers of the first apostolic missions in the north, 
U||RUSSIA AND THE BABIS 125 
U||challenged and suffered death with virile fortitude, 
U||as one of the Seven Martyrs of Teheran. No memory 
U||is more deeply venerated or kindles greater enthusiasm 
U||than hers, and the influence which she wielded in her 
U||lifetime still enures to her sex. That women, whom 
U||orthodox Islam barely credits with the possession of a 
U||soul, are freely admitted to the meetings of Babis, gives 
U||their enemies, the Mullahs, ample occasion to blas- 
U||pheme. But they have never produced a tittle of 
U||evidence in support of the vague charges of immorality 
U||they are wont to bring against the followers of the new 
U||creed. Communism and socialism are also often im- 
U||puted to them, and some of them appear to have 
U||borrowed from the West the terminology of advanced 
U||democracy. Probably Babiism is still in a state of flux, 
U||and represents, apart from its doctrinal aspects, an 
U||association of many heterogeneous elements loosely 
U||bound together by a common spirit of revolt against 
U||the scandalous depravity of the Court, the corruption 
U||of the ruling classes, and the intolerance and greed of 
U||the orthodox clergy. 
U||Perhaps the best proof of the widespread influence of 
U||Babiism is the attention which the Russians have paid 
U||to it. One of their ablest agents. Captain Toumanky, 
U||has made careful studies of the Babi movement in all 
U||its bearings, and translated the most important of its 
U||scriptures into Russian. Throughout Persia they keep 
U||in close touch with its leaders, thus acquiring valuable 
U||sources of information amongst all classes, and on 
U||Russian territory outside the Persian frontier they 
U||treat the Babis with marked favour, as, for instance, 
U||at Ashkabad, where they have been given land by the 
U||Russian authorities for the erection of a conventicle. 
U||It is, however, difficult even for the Russians always to 
U||126 
U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||hunt with the hounds and run with the hare, and during 
U||the recent riots at Isfahan the Babis who tried to seek 
U||refuge at the Russian Consulate found it closed against 
U||them, and were massacred at its very gates. Even 
U||amongst the Persian official classes Babiism is supposed 
U||to have found protectors in high places, the Atabeg-Azam 
U||himself having been credited with a desire to stand well 
U||with the Babis, though he is the last man to whom their 
U||moral aspirations would appeal. He was, however, a 
U||strong believer in the policy of making friends unto 
U||himself in every camp, and whilst cultivating the good- 
U||will of the Mullahs^ he no doubt sought to impress 
U||upon the Babis that they might have worse enemies 
U||than him. But the outbreaks which have taken place 
U||this year (May-June, 1903) at so many and far-distant 
U||centres as Yezd and Isfahan, Tabriz and Shiraz, show 
U||that if the Babis really imagined they could put their 
U||trust in him they were leaning on a broken reed. 
U||Earlier in the year, in February, there had been some 
U||anti-Babi riots in Teheran in connection with the burial 
U||of a reputed Babi, but the authorities put them down, 
U||the initiative, it is worth noting, having been taken by 
U||a party of Cossacks, belonging to General Kosa- 
U||gowsky’s brigade, amongst whom were several Babis, 
U||who at once intervened vigorously for the protection of 
U||their co-religionists. In the provinces, however, the 
U||word was apparently passed round to give the Mullahs a 
U||free hand. Ever since the Shah’s return from Europe in 
U||the autumn of 1902 the attitude of the orthodox clergy 
U||had caused some apprehension at Teheran. The ex- 
U||travagance of the Court, the Russian loans, the 
U||appreciation of the cost of living, and the general 
U||distress and misery of the country, had intensified 
U||popular discontent, and it was feared that the more 
U||BABI MASSACRES IN 1903 
U||127 
U||fanatical Mullahs might give voice to it by raising a 
U||dangerous cry that the country was being sold to the 
U||Infidels. At such times it is no small advantage to 
U||have ready to hand an inoffensive and unprotected 
U||community upon whom the passions of the mob can be 
U||deflected. The savage massacres of Babis enacted at 
U||different points of the kingdom have been the worst 
U||that have taken place since 1852, but the Mullahs were 
U||for the time being appeased, and the Atabeg-Azam 
U||could boast of having once more restored peace to the 
U||realm of the enlightened and humane Sovereign, upon 
U||whom the most noble Order of the Garter had just been 
U||conferred. Babiism, however, has lived through worse 
U||days than these, and under Muzaffer-ed-Din Shah, as 
U||under his father, Nasr-ed-Din, the blood of martyrs 
U||may have served but to quicken the seeds of a new 
U||harvest. 
U||Though unconnected with Babiism, there are two 
U||other recent developments in the religious domain 
U||which may as well be noted here. The survival of a 
U||faithful remnant of the ancient fire-worshippers of 
U||Persia has begun to attract the attention and sympathy 
U||of the wealthy and influential Parsee communities 
U||of India. These Zoroastrians, or Ghebrs as they are 
U||more commonly called, only number about io,ooo alto- 
U||gether, and most of them inhabit Yezd and Kerman, 
U||But as small traders, and even more as gardeners, 
U||in which capacity they enjoy considerable reputation, 
U||they are to be found scattered all over Persia. The 
U||Bombay Parsees have of late taken a very practical 
U||interest in the fate of their Persian co-religionists. 
U||They have not only given them local support in matters 
U||of worship and education, but they now maintain a 
U||regular agent for their benefit at Teheran. He has. 
U||128 
U||THE REVIVAL OF BABIISM 
U||of course, no official status, but his friendly representa- 
U||tions carry some weight with the Central Government. 
U||The Parsees are both wealthy and generous, and they 
U||know how to approach the ruling classes of Persia. 
U||The Nestorians, or as they prefer to call themselves, 
U||the Syrians of the highlands of Kurdistan, are one of 
U||the most ancient and interesting of the Christian com- 
U||munities of Asia, On both sides of the frontier — under 
U||Turkish and under Persian rule — they have succeeded 
U||in maintaining an ecclesiastical organisation, differing 
U||probably but little from that of the early ages of 
U||Christianity, though they have had their own sectarian 
U||quarrels amongst themselves, and those on the Turkish 
U||side of the frontier entered into communion with Rome 
U||in the seventeenth century under a separate Patriarch 
U||known as the Patriarch of Babylon. The Persian Nes- 
U||torians preserved complete religious autonomy coupled 
U||with certain political rights of self-government until 
U||quite 'recently. But as they saw the latter gradually 
U||whittled down by their Persian rulers, a considerable 
U||section threw itself a few years ago into the arms 
U||of Russia. More than half of the Persian Nestorians, 
U||including three bishops, were received into the bosom 
U||of the Russian Orthodox Church, and a party of 
U||Russian priests under an Archimandrite were sent down 
U||to take charge of the new flock. The political results 
U||have not, it appears, so far quite fulfilled the expecta- 
U||tions of the converts, as Russian diplomacy, busy with 
U||other things, has failed to fight their battles at Teheran 
U||with the energy which had been hoped for. But Russia, 
U||who knows the uses of spiritual patronage in Eastern 
U||countries, will, no doubt, set matters right as soon 
U||as the moment comes for turning the ecclesiastical 
U||allegiance of the Nestorians to practical account. 
U||CHAPTER XII 
U||FROM TEHERAN TO ISFAHAN 
U||L ord Salisbury recommended the use of 
U||^ large scale maps to students of Asiatic politics. 
U||Still more useful, as far as Persia is concerned, would 
U||be a map showing the proportion of cultivated to un- 
U||cultivated land as it is to-day, as it has been in the 
U||past, and as it might be in the future under an intelli- 
U||gent and honest administration. Our maps show clearly 
U||enough the well-known desert plains which extend over 
U||a large belt of Eastern Persia, but they give no 
U||indication whatever of the infinitesimal proportion 
U||in which cultivated lands stand to arid wastes in the 
U||rest of Persia. So trifling and inconspicuous are the 
U||scattered patches of cultivation when compared with 
U||the vast tracts of sterile wilderness that Persia has been 
U||not inaptly described as ‘‘a series of small deserts in 
U||a big desert.” Yet with the exception of the salt deserts 
U||and the bare rock of the great mountain ranges hardly 
U||any land in Persia should be barren. Wherever a 
U||perennial flow of water can be brought to it the soil 
U||is abundantly fertile. Nothing is more striking than 
U||the suddenness with which, 
U||‘ ‘ Along' some strip of herbage strown 
U||That just divides the desert from the sown/’ 
U||one passes again and again in the course of a day’s 
U||K 
U||129 
U||130 
U||FROM TEHERAN TO ISFAHAN 
U||journey out of the bare sun-scorched wilderness into 
U||an oasis of verdant fields and shady groves. There is 
U||nothing to differentiate the soil of the oasis from that of 
U||the wilderness except that the one is parched, the other 
U||is blessed with water. In no country, therefore, is the 
U||question of irrigation of more paramount importance 
U||than in Persia, yet in none is it more criminally 
U||neglected by its rulers. 
U||The Persian peasant does his best to eke out with 
U||the limited resources at his disposal the scanty stock 
U||of water which nature, unassisted, supplies, and the 
U||elaborate system of kandts^ or underground aqueducts, 
U||dug out of the hard soil in order to distribute over the 
U||largest possible area the meagre output of some slender 
U||spring or mountain stream, testifies to his indefatigable 
U||industry. The mounds of earth, like exaggerated 
U||mole-hills, thrown up from the shafts which have been 
U||sunk at frequent intervals to dig these kandts, or, sub- 
U||sequently, to keep them free from obstruction, are a 
U||conspicuous feature in the Persian landscape, and a 
U||grateful one to the traveller, as they always indicate 
U||the vicinity of a village, and with it a break in the 
U||monotony of the great drab-coloured wastes — unless 
U||indeed, as is too often the case, they are merely aban- 
U||doned kandts bearing witness to past prosperity and 
U||present decay. Though sometimes they are carried for 
U||two or three miles across the plain from the foot-hills of 
U||the mountain range to some specially fertile patch 
U||of land, and represent a vast expenditure of human 
U||labour, the kandt system is after all only a primitive 
U||makeshift. Persia wants water-storage on a much 
U||larger and more adequate scale. The winter snows 
U||and rains, though of short duration, are abundant 
U||enough, but they run for the greater part to. waste. 
U||WATER-STORAGE 
U||Pouring with torrential violence down the precipitous 
U||flanks of the denuded mountain ranges, they plough 
U||deep furrows at random across the plains until, in the 
U||great majority of cases, they lose themselves in a salt 
U||marsh or disappear by the mere process of evaporation 
U||under the fierce Persian sun. Yet this waste might be 
U||easily prevented, or at least mitigated, at no great 
U||outlay of money or engineering skill. The network 
U||of mountains which spreads over the greater part of 
U||Persia offers incomparable facilities for storing water 
U||in a number of local reservoirs by damming up the 
U||narrow gorges through which the winter rains stream 
U||down into the plains. At Isfahan, for instance, at the 
U||time of my visit in October, 1902, the broad bed of 
U||the Zendeh Rud had been absolutely dry for two 
U||months, to the serious injury of one of the most 
U||fertile plains in Persia. The water famine in the city 
U||and its immediate vicinity was partly due to the 
U||action of large and influential landowners, who had 
U||recently diverted an excessive volume of water higher 
U||up the river in order to irrigate their own properties 
U||at the expense of the villages of the plain ; but a bund 
U||could be easily constructed to hold up during flood time 
U||the waters of the Zendeh Rud, which now run to waste 
U||in a salt marsh some fifty or sixty miles east of the 
U||city, and there would then be a constant water supply, 
U||abundant enough to allow cultivation to be developed 
U||at every available point, without robbing Peter to pay 
U||Paul. Something also might probably be done in 
U||Persia with artesian wells, though on this point expert 
U||opinion differs, owing to the peculiarities of the geo- 
U||logical formations. Experiments of a very promising 
U||character were made some years ago by an Englishman 
U||in a waterless district in the neighbourhood of Kerman, 
U||132 
U||FROM TEHERAN TO ISFAHAN 
U||but before their success could be definitely established 
U||the Persian authorities tried to defraud him of his 
U||rights, and before any redress could be obtained the 
U||unfortunate pioneer died of fever. 
U||Irrigation unquestionably offers a large field for 
U||remunerative enterprise, but from the Persians them- 
U||selves little or nothing can be hoped for. There is no 
U||public spirit to take the initiative of such enterprise. 
U||Works of public utility do not enter into the scheme of 
U||Persian government, and the large landowners, who 
U||mostly belong to the official classes, are content to 
U||amass a fortune by squeezing the wretched tiller of the 
U||soil. The dearth of water is, in fact, a powerful instru- 
U||ment in the hands of the ruling class for putting 
U||pressure on the people. By arbitrary interference with 
U||the slender water supply, which is life or death to him, 
U||the small landowner can be made to sell on the great 
U||man’s terms, and the tenant-labourer’s share in the 
U||produce of the soil he tills can be ground down to a 
U||minimum to swell the profits of the landlord. The 
U||system works admirably for the buziirglian^ or ‘‘the 
U||great men.” The capital they invest in the purchase 
U||of a village usually returns 40-60 per cent, per annum, 
U||and if the screw has been judiciously applied it may 
U||return as much as 200 per cent, per annum — until the 
U||whirligig of fortune brings the great man under the 
U||heel of a greater man, who promptly annexes a large 
U||share of his ill-gotten gains. 
U||In times like the present, when cupidity and extrava- 
U||gance are more than ever rampant in the highest 
U||places, and a vague sense of impending national 
U||disaster is creeping over the whole country, all the 
U||evils inseparable from the social system of Persia are 
U||multiplied and aggravated. The six days’ journey down 
U||CITIES IN DECAY 
U||133 
U||from Teheran to Isfahan last autumn intensified the 
U||impression of universal neglect and decay which my 
U||visit to Persia eighteen years ago had already left on 
U||my mind. With the single exception of the carriage- 
U||road built, and until then maintained at a considerable 
U||loss, by the Imperial Bank of Persia, there was not a 
U||single sign of progress to be noted anywhere. The 
U||villages are few and far between, and across the inter- 
U||vening tracts of barren wilderness the only signs of 
U||human life are the long files of mules and camels, whose 
U||constant footfall has trodden out the only roads that 
U||the Persian knows of. Kum, second of the holy cities 
U||of Persia, still contrives to live on the devotion of the 
U||pilgrims who flock from all parts of the Shia world 
U||to worship at the shrine of Fatima-el-Masuma, the 
U||sister of Imam Reza, and the great golden dome of the 
U||mosque in which she is buried, flashing in the evening 
U||sun against a background of purple hills, shed, as I 
U||approached it, a glamour of ancient grandeur over the 
U||maze of ruinous alleys and dilapidated bazaars into 
U||which the town resolves itself on closer inspection. Of 
U||the stone quays which once lined the river banks, of 
U||the stately caravanserais and the “wel-built, sweet, and 
U||wel-furnished ” houses of which Le Brun, as quoted by 
U||Lord Curzon, tells us a couple of centuries ago, scarcely 
U||a trace remains, Kashan, which was still, not many 
U||years ago, an important industrial centre, famous for its 
U||silk and satin fabrics, as well as for its pottery and 
U||copper wares, has fallen into even greater decay. Its 
U||industries languish, its population diminishes, and the 
U||inhabited quarters of the town are almost lost amidst 
U||the ruins of its former self. Everywhere on this great 
U||highway between the modern and the ancient capitals 
U||of Persia the squalor^of decrepitude and poverty seems 
U||134 
U||FROM TEHERAN TO ISFAHAN 
U||to have increased ; deserted villages, abandoned cara- 
U||vanserais, exhausted kandts, broken-down bridges, mark 
U||the steady progress of decay. The picture .which the 
U||country itself presents would be intolerably depressing 
U||were it not for the perpetual enchantment of sunny 
U||days and starlit nights, and an invigorating atmosphere 
U||of incomparable purity, whilst every morning and every 
U||evening the ‘‘false dawn’’ and the afterglow, flooding 
U||the whole landscape of plain and mountain with their 
U||luminous glory, seem in very truth to “shed love on all 
U||that lives and peace on lifeless things.” 
U||Isfahan itself is to-day merely magni nofiiims umbra. 
U||The same circle of delicately scarped hills overlooks a 
U||fertile plain of green fields and leafy orchards, studded 
U||with stately plane trees, as in the time of the great Shah 
U||Abbas, but of the splendid city which excited the 
U||wonder and admiration of European travellers in the 
U||days when Elizabeth reigned in England and Akbar at 
U||Delhi only enough has survived to mark the contrast 
U||between the Persia of the past and the Persia of to-day. 
U||Whole quarters of the city are deserted and in ruins ; 
U||of the bazaars, which were once the finest and most 
U||thriving marts of Western Asia, many are entirely 
U||abandoned, and but few more than partially tenanted, 
U||though the busy scenes of Eastern life which may still 
U||be seen in some of them can hardly be surpassed for 
U||diversity and picturesqueness,- the Chehar Bagh still 
U||exists, but its avenues of giant plane trees have long 
U||since been ruthlessly thinned ; water no longer flows 
U||down them through a succession of marble channels 
U||and ornamental basins; the palaces and mansions 
U||which overlooked the terraced gardens have sunk into 
U||shapeless mud heaps ; and even the splendid Madresseh 
U||of Shah Hussein, which twenty years ago was still one 
U||KAJAR VANDALISM 
U||135 
U||of the noblest sights of Isfahan, has been robbed of 
U||most of its beautiful tiles, and is fast falling into ruinous 
U||decay. The same fate is overtaking the pillared gal- 
U||leries of the monumental bridge of Ali Verdi Khan, by 
U||far the most magnificent of the five great bridges which 
U||span the broad and shallow bed of the Zendeh Rud. 
U||No trace whatever remains of the Hazar Jerib, the great 
U||royal pleasaunce of ^‘a thousand acres.” In spite of 
U||the neglect with which the Kajar dynasty seems 
U||deliberately to treat every reminder of the greatness 
U||of their Sefavi predecessors, the superb mosque 
U||erected by Shah Abbas on the Meidan still remains 
U||unique, but not unscathed, in the glory of its green- 
U||and-blue tiled dome and minarets ; but in the ancient 
U||palace of the Sefavi princes, where the Zill-es-Sultan 
U||now resides as Governor, the few clumsy attempts 
U||that have been made at restoration have done more 
U||to mar the artistic beauty of the buildings than 
U||the ravages of deliberate vandalism. In the loggia 
U||of the Chehil Sitoon, or Hall of Forty Columns, the 
U||graceful mirror-work ornamentation of the walls and 
U||pillars has been torn down to make room for daubs of 
U||garish paint, and the hall itself, once the throne-room 
U||of the greatest of Persian monarchs, is now used as a 
U||godown for the storage of the Zill-es-Sultan’s travelling 
U||tents and carpets ; the blue and gold arabesques of the 
U||gorgeous vaulted ceilings are cracked and crumbling 
U||away in places, and the six immense oil paintings, in 
U||which the martial prowess of the Sefavi kings and the 
U||magnificence of their courtly pageants were blazoned 
U||forth with no mean artistic skill, are growing grimy 
U||with the dust of years. The entire population of the 
U||city, with the villages of the surrounding plain, is not 
U||estimated to-day at more than a quarter of a million. 
U||136 
U||FROM TEHERAN TO ISFAHAN 
U||whereas two-and-half centuries ago the estimates for the 
U||city alone varied between 600,000 and 1,100,000, and 
U||within ten leagues of its walls Chardin counted 1,500 
U||villages. The days are indeed past when it was the 
U||proud boast of its people that Isfahan was half the 
U||world — Isfahan nusfelfehan. 
U||Yet Isfahan has had the advantage of being governed 
U||for the last twenty-eight years by a Prince who enjoys 
U||the reputation of being in many respects the strongest 
U||and ablest man in Persia, and certainly in the Royal 
U||Family of Persia. The Zill-es-Sultan is the eldest living 
U||son of the late Shah, though, as his mother was not of 
U||royal birth, he was not entitled to the succession. 
U||His power and prestige were at one time immense, for 
U||he was not only Governor of Isfahan, but of all the 
U||southern provinces of Persia — Pars, Arabistan, Luri- 
U||stan, Kurdistan, Yezd, and half a dozen others. He 
U||ruled almost as an independent Prince over two-thirds 
U||of the whole kingdom, and he ruled with undisputed 
U||vigour and energy, maintaining order and security with 
U||an iron hand. He had even reinforced his authority 
U||by creating an army under his own control of over 
U||20,000 men, whose training, equipment, and discipline 
U||were, at any rate, incomparably superior to anything 
U||that the rest of Persia could show. But his influence 
U||and the leaning towards England with which he was 
U||credited gave umbrage to Russia, and her agents 
U||worked hand in hand with the many enemies, whom 
U||he owed as much to his good qualities as to his faults, 
U||to secure his downfall. Summoned suddenly to Teheran, 
U||in 1888, he obeyed the summons, relying upon the 
U||special favour and affection which his father had always 
U||displayed towards him. But Nasr-ed-Din’s mind had 
U||been effectually poisoned against him, and when he 
U||GOING TO VISIT THE ZILL-ES-SULTAN 
U||THE ZILL-ES-SULTAN 
U||137 
U||came back to Isfahan, he returned merely as Governor 
U||of the one province. All his other provinces had been 
U||taken away from him, and his army had been disbanded 
U||or drafted away. He is believed to have accepted his 
U||disgrace with Oriental fatalism, and in a spirit of 
U||dutiful resignation to his father’s will. Whatever may 
U||have been his earlier ambitions, fie would seem to have 
U||been equally mindful of his father’s wishes after the 
U||latter’s death, for as soon as the news of Nasr-ed-Din’s 
U||assassination reached him he hastened to telegraph to 
U||his brother, the Vali Ahd at Tabriz, assuring him of 
U||his own loyalty, and holding himself personally re- 
U||sponsible for that of his province. There are, never- 
U||theless, many who hold that it would have been far 
U||better for Persia if he had succeeded to the throne 
U||instead of Muzaffer-ed-Din. Though he was now fifty- 
U||two years old, the two decades which had nearly elapsed 
U||since I was first received by the Zill-es-Sultan did not 
U||appear to have impaired either his vigour of mind or 
U||his alertness of manner. Of his qualities as a firm, if 
U||masterful, ruler, I can only speak from hearsay ; but 
U||in the course of the long conversation with which I was 
U||honoured by his Highness, I had ample opportunity of 
U||appreciating his perspicacity and astuteness, as well as 
U||his ready wit and humour. 
U||Isfahan, like the rest of Persia, was suffering from the 
U||severe depression of trade, due in part to unfavourable 
U||economic conditions — and especially the relentless de- 
U||preciation of the kran, the unit of silver currency — and 
U||in part to growing anxiety with regard to political 
U||developments in Teheran. Popular discontent ap- 
U||peared in Central Persia to be more profound or more 
U||freely expressed than in the North, and people asked 
U||with undisguised bitterness what was to be the end of 
U||I3S 
U||FROM TEHERAN TO ISFAHAN 
U||the profligate course of extravagance upon which 
U||Teheran has entered. In spite of the establishment of 
U||a Russian Consulate in a city where there are not, I 
U||believe, a dozen Russian subjects to be protected, and 
U||of the importation of a guard of Russian Cossacks — 
U||whose appearance, however, hardly compared favour- 
U||ably with that of the smart Indian sowars who act as 
U||escort to the British Consul-General — Russian influence 
U||had so far acquired little direct hold over this part of 
U||Persia, and those who took the most despondent view 
U||of the future of their country still turned with almost 
U||pathetic confidence for help to England, and to Eng- 
U||land alone. Amongst the more thoughtful, however, 
U||that confidence seemed to be rapidly waning. ‘‘Eng- 
U||land,” they said, “is lavish enough of her assurances 
U||of friendship, and we do not distrust her intentions ; 
U||but what we want are deeds, not words, and the deeds 
U||are not forthcoming. To-day she still has many friends 
U||in the South of Persia, but the time is coming when it 
U||will be too dangerous to be counted amongst her friends, 
U||if she will not raise a finger to help them. If we are 
U||to be left to the tender mercies of new masters from 
U||the North, we must ultimately make terms with them, 
U||and England will learn too late what those terms may 
U||mean to her.” I am quite aware that the value of such 
U||language from Oriental lips must be largely discounted, 
U||but it is none the less significant and worth noting 
U||that, whereas formerly England was the only foreign 
U||Power whose existence seemed to be in any way recog- 
U||nised at Isfahan, to-day she is already being weighed 
U||in the scale against Russia, and the balance is little 
U||more than even. What was, perhaps, even more 
U||significant was that just before my arrival a large 
U||order for 700 bales of cotton prints from Russia had 
U||RUSSIAN COTTON GOODS 
U||139 
U||for the first time been placed in the Isfahan market. 
U||Hitherto, though the activity of the Russian Bank at 
U||Teheran had already made itself adversely felt, Russian 
U||trade had only made experimental incursions on a 
U||small scale into this field, but the operation I have just 
U||mentioned was evidently intended as the prelude to a 
U||campaign of bounty-fed competition with British trade 
U||in Central as well as in Northern Persia. 
U||CHAPTER XIII 
U||THROUGH THE BAKHTIARI MOUNTAINS TO THE 
U||PERSIAN GULF 
U||F rom Isfahan to the Persian Gulf the most fre- 
U||quented route is that which leads past the ruins 
U||of Persepolis to Shiraz and thence descends the great 
U||mountain ladder of Pars to Bushire. But I had travelled 
U||by it during my former visit to Persia, and, within the 
U||last few years, British enterprise has opened up a new 
U||route to the Persian Gulf, which, if adequate support is 
U||forthcoming, should prove of both commercial and 
U||political importance, while it certainly is what our 
U||American cousins would call ‘^the great scenic route” 
U||of Southern Persia. I decided therefore to travel 
U||through the Bakhtiari Mountains and down the Karun 
U||to Muhammerah. 
U||It is difficult to explain the physical charm of Persian 
U||travel. I have done my share of travelling in the high- 
U||ways and byways of the East from the Syrian Desert 
U||to the Great Wall of China, but Persia has a mysterious 
U||attraction of which I have nowhere found the like. 
U||Not the Persia of the towns, even such as Isfahan, still 
U||clothed with some majestic remnants of a magnificent 
U||past, or Shiraz, where the scent of old-time roses still 
U||hangs about the gardens where Hafiz and Sadi used to 
U||walk, and the shadow of ancient cypresses still falls 
U||athwart their tombs, but the Persia of far-spread desert 
U||140 
U||IN THE r.AKHTIARI MOUNTAIN^ 
U||THE CHARM OF PERSIAN TRAVEL 141 
U||and lofty mountain, with its rare oases and hidden 
U||valleys ; the Persia of immense spaces and infinite 
U||solitude broken only by ‘‘the footfall mute of the slow 
U||camel, which strikes and makes no sound,” or by the 
U||tinkling bells of a more bustling caravan of pack- 
U||mules ; the Persia of brilliant sun-bathed days and 
U||of solemn starlit nights, and of those yet more precious 
U||hours of morn and eve when by the Great Magician’s 
U||wand the whole earth and the heavens above are turned 
U||to glory. At daybreak the camp is' astir, and before 
U||the sun has scaled the purple crest of the furthermost 
U||mountains the tents are struck, the baggage animals 
U||are being packed for the march, and one starts oflF on 
U||his pony for the morning’s ride, which should cover the 
U||best part of the day’s journey. Pretty well the whole 
U||of Persia, after the first steep climb from the lowlands, 
U||whether of the Caspian or of the Persian Gulf, is a lofty 
U||plateau varying between three and five thousand feet 
U||above the level of the sea, broken by successive ranges 
U||of mountains mostly ten to twelve thousand feet high, 
U||and rising in parts to much greater altitudes. The 
U||morning air, even in the early autumn, is always crisp, 
U||sometimes frosty, but long before one has reached 
U||the midday halting-ground, the sun pours down with 
U||conquering force. In the course of the five or six 
U||hours’ ride, which makes a fair forenoon stage, de- 
U||licious canters across small and fairly level plateaus 
U||have alternated with steep climbs up and down the 
U||precipitous slopes of intervening hills, where your 
U||pony casts many an appealing glance at you as, 
U||leading him by the reins, yau try to pull him down 
U||some particularly bad drop until, uttering his sad 
U||grunt, he at last makes up his mind to step down 
U||on all four feet at once. By the time the sun has 
U||142 THROUGH THE BAKHTIARI MOUNTAINS 
U||reached the zenith, both man and beast are ready to 
U||welcome the sudden shade of trees, with a noise of 
U||rushing waters, which invites repose after a refreshing 
U||plunge in a clear pool and a frugal meal. Presently 
U||one^s caravan, which toils at a slower pace, unresting 
U||throughout the day, passes on its way to the next 
U||camping-ground with a jingling of many bells and a 
U||hum of urgent voices. It will be time enough to 
U||follow it up in another hour. Then, when the shadows 
U||are beginning to lengthen, we shall come up to our 
U||camp as it is being pitched for the night on the edge 
U||of some other strip of herbage, whose tender green 
U||fledges the river’s lip.” Whilst the evening meal is 
U||being prepared the sun sinks, as it sank yesterday and 
U||will sink again to-morrow, out of the golden sky behind 
U||long-drawn ranges of delicately chiselled mountains, 
U||which reflect in turn every tint of the painted heavens. 
U||But has it sunk? Suddenly the sky, w’'hich had already 
U||faded from a pale sea-green into an ashen grey, flashes 
U||up once more into crimson and gold, and every hill- 
U||top is flushed with a responsive glow. But it is only a 
U||transient moment of infinite beauty, the brief spell of 
U||the “after-glow,” and long before sleep, though seldom 
U||slow to come, has descended upon our camp the stars 
U||have peeped out, first one by one, and then in their 
U||millions, until the whole firmament throbs with the 
U||eternal flame of their quivering lamps. Save the 
U||occasional bark of a jackal wandering hungrily around, 
U||and the steady crunching of the mules and ponies as 
U||they feed, tethered a few yards off from our tents, there 
U||is not a sound to break the deep silence of the night, 
U||until once more : — 
U||“ morning- in the bowl of night 
U||Has flung the stone that puts the stars to flight. 
U||And, lo ! the hunter of the East has caught 
U||The Sultan’s turret in a noose of light.” 
U||A GRACIOUS LANDSCAPE 
U||143 
U||To those in whom some inherited instincts of nomadic 
U||life still linger I would above all recommend a spring 
U||or an autumn journey through the Bakhtiari mountains 
U||from Isfahan to the Persian Gulf. Geographically, and 
U||within certain limitations politically, the country of 
U||the Bakhtiaris belongs to Persia, but, though in Persia, 
U||it is in most respects not of Persia — at least, not of 
U||modern Persia. Sturdy oak trees cling to the flanks 
U||of the rugged mountain gorges, through which the 
U||Karun and its tributaries have carved a way for their 
U||turquoise blue waters, unsullied as the snows that feed 
U||them ; oak and beech and plane tree cluster round 
U||every mountain spring ; the spacious groves which 
U||clothe the greater part of the undulating uplands lack 
U||only a carpet of green grass to complete their re- 
U||semblance to an English park; after the first autumn 
U||rains, yellow and mauve crocuses spread a network of 
U||colour over the brown soil before the tribesman’s primi- 
U||tive plough prepares it to receive the seed for the winter 
U||harvest. Stern as the face of nature often is amidst 
U||the towering crags and deep ravines of the Bakhtiari 
U||mountains, it seldom wears that forbidding aspect of 
U||utter desolation peculiar to the waterless, sun-scorched 
U||regions between Teheran and Isfahan, and between 
U||Isfahan and Shiraz, which, though not devoid of a 
U||certain grim picturesqueness, is apt to grow depressing 
U||in its weird monotony. It is an easy march of about 
U||eighteen days from Isfahan to Ahwaz on the Karun, 
U||whence a steamer runs down to Muhammerah in a 
U||couple of days. The interest of the journey is perhaps 
U||more diversified than that of any other expedition 
U||which can be as easily compassed in Persia. For it 
U||takes the traveller out of what may still be called the 
U||heart of Persia proper, namely, the plain of Isfahan, 
U||144 THROUGH THE BAKHTIA.RI MOUNTAINS 
U||through the mountain fastnesses of semi-independent 
U||tribesmen, down into the great alluvial plains washed 
U||by the Persian Gulf, where the population, though 
U||owning allegiance to the Shah, is mainly Arab by race 
U||and language. Our caravan was itself a microcosm of 
U||this strange medley of tongues and peoples. Some of 
U||our muleteers were pure Persians, whilst others were 
U||Arabs from the Karun valley ; our cook was a Chris- 
U||tian Arab from the Tigris, and one of our servants 
U||was a Persian Turk from the northern provinces. 
U||Bakhtiari tribesmen from time to time swelled our 
U||retinue, and to add to its picturesque variety an Indian 
U||fakir^ who had been on pilgrimage to the Shia shrines 
U||of Meshed and Kum, and was proceeding to the yet 
U||holier shrines of Kerbela and Karsimein, under a vow 
U||to recite during the middle watch of every night certain 
U||chapters of the Koran, tacked himself on to us as we 
U||entered the Bakhtiari country, always ready to fag for 
U||our servants, collecting firewood and carrying water, in 
U||return for protection and a daily bowl of rice. The 
U||Bakhtiari country is, like the rest of Persia, but sparsely 
U||populated, and when one has left the villages of the 
U||Zendeh Rud and Bistagoon valleys behind him — a 
U||slender thread of verdure winding across a broad 
U||yellow belt of desert between the hills encircling 
U||Isfahan thirty miles away and the first buttresses of 
U||the Bakhtiari mountains proper — hardly another sub- 
U||stantial village, except one or two that have clustered 
U||round the summer residences of the great Bakhtiari 
U||chiefs, is to be met with until the Karun is reached. 
U||But the trade route which has been opened up of recent 
U||years through this region has familiarised the people 
U||with the wants of travellers, and so long as the latter 
U||BAKHTIARI TRIBESMEN (p. 152) 
U||THE BEGINNINGS OF A NEW TRADE ROUTE 145 
U||are content with very simple fare, they need have no 
U||anxiety about supplies in the shape of milk and eggs 
U||and fowls and an occasional sheep. 
U||The possibility of developing a new trade route, or 
U||rather of reviving a very ancient one, from the Persian 
U||Gulf to Isfahan by the Karun river and across the 
U||Bakhtiari mountains, had suggested itself in the first 
U||half of the last century to the eager young explorer 
U||who afterwards, as Sir Henry Layard, became a 
U||prominent figure in the diplomacy of the Near East. 
U||In fact, but for the sudden downfall of Muhammed Taki 
U||Khan, the idea might then and there have taken 
U||practical shape, for Layard had established strong 
U||claims to the friendship and gratitude of the great 
U||Bakhtiari chieftain, and the latter had been ready and 
U||anxious to forward the scheme. But that opportunity 
U||passed away, as did another and still more propitious 
U||one, when an Anglo-Indian force actually occupied the 
U||Karun valley from Muhammerah to Ahwaz during the 
U||Persian expedition of 1857. Twenty years later Mr. 
U||(now Sir) George Mackenzie, an active partner in the 
U||firm of Gray, Paul and Co. at Bushire, one of the 
U||numerous firms affiliated to the British India Steam 
U||Navigation Company, proceeded to Teheran with 
U||fresh offers of co-operation from another powerful 
U||Ilkhani of the Bakhtiaris, but the negotiations proved 
U||abortive, and it was not until 1888 that Sir Henry 
U||Drummond Wolff, then British Minister to Persia, 
U||inserted the thin end of the wedge by inducing the 
U||Shah to issue a special Firman thi owing the Karun 
U||river open to foreign navigation. Such, at least, 
U||was the purport of the Firman, though the Persian 
U||authorities lost no time, as I shall have occasion to 
U||L 
U||146 THROUGH THE BAKHTIARI MOUNTAINS 
U||show later on, in trying to withdraw with the left hand, 
U||by local obstruction, what they had given at Teheran 
U||with the right. 
U||Immensely exaggerated as were the expectations 
U||based at the time upon the paper promises of the 
U||Shah’s Firman, the first step had been made, and 
U||the enterprising firm which had undertaken, on the 
U||invitation of the British Government, to act as the 
U||pioneers of navigation on the Karun was quick to 
U||realise the urgency of the second step. Immediately 
U||upon the issue of the Firman Messrs. Lynch Brothers, 
U||who had been connected for half a century with the 
U||navigation of the Tigris, placed one of their steamers 
U||on the Karun, and Mr. H. B. Lynch proceeded to 
U||investigate on the spot the question of road communi- 
U||cations between that river and Isfahan by travelling 
U||through the Bakhtiari country and renewing relations 
U||with the chiefs. A valuable report of his journey 
U||appeared in September, 1890, in the same number of 
U||the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society as 
U||Lord Curzon’s address on the Karun river and the 
U||geography of South-Western Persia. The mills of 
U||diplomacy, however, grind slowly, and another eight 
U||years elapsed before the protracted negotiations were 
U||brought to a conclusion. In 1898 an agreement was 
U||arrived at under the auspices of the British Legation 
U||and with the sanction and ultimate guarantee of the 
U||Persian Government, under which Messrs. Lynch 
U||undertook to build, on behalf of the Bakhtiari chiefs, 
U||a caravan road available for mule traffic from Ahwaz 
U||on the Karun to Isfahan. In 1900 the two important 
U||bridges which had to be thrown across the upper 
U||waters of the Karun at Godar-i-Balukat and across 
U||its tributary, the Ab-i-Bazuft, at Pul Amarat — the only 
U||THE “LYNCH ROAD” 
U||147 
U||two suspension bridges in Persia — were completed, 
U||and the new road ready for traffic. 
U||The ‘‘Lynch road,"’ as it is commonly called, would 
U||probably receive but scant praise from Western travel- 
U||lers unaccustomed to the break-neck tracks over which 
U||the traffic of the East has been carried for centuries in 
U||all mountainous regions ; but, given the conditions 
U||under which it was constructed, and the nature of the 
U||country it traverses, it is certainly no mean achieve- 
U||ment, and it compares, at any rate, very favourably 
U||with its chief rival, the caravan road from Shiraz to 
U||Bushire. Between Isfahan, which lies at an altitude of 
U||5,200 feet above sea-level, and Ahwaz, which is barely 
U||300 feet above the sea, it has to scale four distinct chains 
U||of mountains, of which the highest — the Mungasht — 
U||rises to over 12,000 feet, besides the many lesser ranges 
U||which form their buttresses. This great mountain 
U||system, which runs roughly north-west and south-east 
U||— i.e, at right angles to the Lynch road — has been 
U||successfully negotiated, and though for six or seven out 
U||of an eighteen days’ march we had daily ascents and 
U||descents of 2,000 feet and more, the highest level which 
U||the road reached was 7>8oo feet. Persian muleteers are, 
U||in fact, so accustomed to the roughest mountain tracks 
U||that there are few slopes, however precipitous, up and 
U||down which a track cannot be engineered to meet their 
U||modest requirements. One of the most difficult bits of 
U||work in laying out the new caravan route was to find 
U||some way of turning the lofty Zirrah range, which 
U||forms the second of the four mountain barriers I have 
U||alluded to, and in the winter, after heavy snows, is 
U||quite impassable. A way was ultimately discovered 
U||by following the deep gorge of a stream which seems to 
U||have cleft the range in two as with a giant’s knife. Along 
U||148 THROUGH THE BAKHTIARI MOUNTAINS 
U||this gorge, to which the muleteers have given a pictur- 
U||esque name which may be rendered as the Gorge of the 
U||Pulling up and Letting down of Skirts, — in allusion to 
U||their practice of pulling their baggy trousers up at the 
U||waist when there is a steep ascent and letting them down 
U||when there is a sharp descent, — the track, often blasted 
U||out of the solid rock, now rises and falls in a series of 
U||bold zigzags, sometimes climbing round the edge of a 
U||blank wall of rock several hundred feet high, sometimes 
U||plunging down to the very bed of the foaming, 
U||thundering torrent. On either side the cliffs rise in 
U||serried masses and jagged teeth to a towering crest line 
U||of embattled peaks more than 10,000 feet above the 
U||level of the sea. So sheer are these tremendous battle- 
U||ments that the sun only reaches for a few hours at 
U||high noon the deep ravine they mount guard over. 
U||Nevertheless the track is so skilfully laid out, and on 
U||the whole so well kept up, that there are few points which 
U||offer any serious difficulty even for heavily loaded 
U||mules. But it is a long detour, which substantially 
U||increases the day’s mileage, the gorge itself extending 
U||over five miles. So, except during the worst months of 
U||the year, when the snow lies deep on the mountain 
U||tops, the muleteers, having no eyes for the incomparable 
U||grandeur of the new route, prefer to take a short cut, 
U||infinitely more arduous, straight over the Zirrah range, 
U||up and down its precipitous slopes, of which no attempt 
U||has been made to mitigate the natural steepness by any 
U||scientific road building. Another bad place along this 
U||route is immediately beyond the bridge over the Ab-i- 
U||Bazuft, as one comes from the North, I had surveyed 
U||it at my leisure as we descended the opposite range to 
U||our camping ground on the previous evening, and 
U||there seemed to be no break of any kind in the sheer

U||IMPROVING PROSPECTS 
U||149 
U||wall over 2,000 feet high, which I was told we should 
U||have to climb. But a track had been cut in one 
U||almost continuous zigzag straight up its face, and, 
U||the next day, within little more than an hour after we 
U||began to climb, we found ourselves upon the crest, with 
U||the river we had crossed at the start gleaming like a 
U||thread of silver in the valley below. 
U||As far as my memory of the old caravan route beyond 
U||Shiraz to the Persian Gulf serves me, not a single point 
U||of the Lynch road could compare for difficulty with the 
U||great kotals, over which the toughest mules groan and 
U||stumble down to Bushire, whilst in addition to greater 
U||immunity from accidents, the Lynch road has the further 
U||advantage of shortness. The land carriage from Ahwaz 
U||to Isfahan is only 277 miles, as against 530 miles from 
U||Bushire to Isfahan. Hence, in spite of the intense con- 
U||servatism of the Persian muleteer, who, it must be re- 
U||membered, practically controls the carrying trade of the 
U||country, the merits of the Lynch road are obtaining 
U||gradual recognition, and last year especially marked 
U||very distinct progress. The Indian Government is send- 
U||ing forward over the Lynch road a large portion of the 
U||materials for the construction of the new direct telegraph 
U||line from Kashan through Yezd and Kerman to Balu- 
U||chistan, and the results have so far been most satis- 
U||factory, as besides a saving of over 30 per cent, on the 
U||cost of freight from the Persian Gulf to Isfahan as 
U||compared with the Bushire route, there has been a still 
U||greater saving of time. Consignments have been 
U||landed by the same steamer at Bushire and at Muham- 
U||merah respectively for conveyance to Isfahan, and the 
U||goods sent up the Karun and over the Bakhtiari road 
U||have been delivered at Isfahan before those sent up 
U||direct from Bushire have even reached Shiraz, which is 
U||ISO THROUGH THE BAKHTIARI MOUNTAINS 
U||barely half-way to Isfahan. The native merchants of 
U||Isfahan are also beginning to appreciate these ad- 
U||vantages for their most valuable exports, such as opium, 
U||and for 1902 the traffic over the Lynch road amounted 
U||to 5,136 loads, as against 2,620 in 1901. 
U||CHAPTER XIV 
U||THE HIGHLAND TRIBESMEN OF PERSIA 
U||I F for the ordinary traveller the chief attraction of the 
U||Bakhtiari route lies in the natural grandeur of the 
U||country, it offers to the political student the additional 
U||advantage of bringing him into contact with one of the 
U||most interesting races that inhabit Persia. The warlike 
U||and hardy nomads who dwell in these mountain fast- 
U||nesses have indeed little in common with the degenerate 
U||townsman or down-trodden villager of Persia proper. 
U||Not much is known as to the origin of the Bakhtiaris, 
U||but the opinion first, I believe, expressed by Layard, that 
U||‘‘they are of pure Iranian blood, the descendants of the 
U||tribes which inhabited the mountains they still occupy 
U||from the remotest antiquity,’’ is now generally accepted. 
U||Their virtues and their vices, their manners and their 
U||customs, are, at any rate, those of free men. A fierce 
U||light plays in their jet-black eyes, and constant exposure 
U||to sun and wind has tanned their skin almost as black 
U||as the raven ringlets that curl over their ears. Muscular 
U||and active like all highlanders, they are also, unlike 
U||most highlanders, splendid horsemen, for though 
U||essentially men of the hills, they are also men of the 
U||plains. They have ceased to be merely pastoral nomads, 
U||and though they still derive their chief means of liveli- 
U||hood from their herds and flocks, they no longer disdain 
U||ISI 
U||152 THE HIGHLAND TRIBESMEN OF PERSIA 
U||to till the soil, whether on the upland slopes, where 
U||they spend the summer months, or on the fertile plains 
U||of Arabistan, to which they descend on the approach of 
U||winter. 
U||When I travelled through the Bakhtiari country, it 
U||was the season for their annual migration from the 
U||highlands to the lowlands, and from time to time we 
U||would overtake a long stream of men and women and 
U||children with their flocks and droves winding slowly 
U||up and down the narrow mountain track, lambs and 
U||kids and babies and chickens and hens tied promis- 
U||cuously, with the rest of the tribal goods and chattels, 
U||on to the backs of the nimble little donkeys and diminu- 
U||tive cows, which serve as beasts of burden. Many of 
U||the men, and a few of the women, rode horses or mules, 
U||but the majority were on foot. Grimy and sunburnt, 
U||and often ragged, their proud bearing and elastic step 
U||stamped them as the lords of the soil they trod, and the 
U||rifle or musket, which even the goat-herd tending his 
U||flock down the mountain side wore jauntily slung across 
U||his back, was only the outward and visible emblem of 
U||the martial spirit transmitted from father to son through 
U||generations of fighting ancestors. Nominally Mussul- 
U||mans as they are nominally Persian subjects, their 
U||allegiance to both the Koran and the Shah sits lightly 
U||upon them. ‘‘No true Bakhtiari,’’ it used to be said, 
U||^‘dies in his bed,” and in defiance of all Mussulman 
U||prejudice and usage, a rough-hewn lion of a conven- 
U||tionally uncouth type, adorned with a sabre and a 
U||pistol, marks in every ancient graveyard the resting- 
U||place of the warrior. As for temporal authority, the 
U||ordinary Bakhtiari, at any rate, looks no further than 
U||the head of his tribe. Courteous and hospitable to 
U||strangers in so far as they enjoy the protection of his 
U||TRIBAL FEUDS 
U||153 
U||chiefs, his powers of discrimination between meum and 
U||tuum appear to be rudimentary, and the predatory in- 
U||stinct is still strong within him. Yet to his own code 
U||of honour, even in the matter of property, he is faith- 
U||ful enough. Every autumn, before leaving the high- 
U||land valleys in which he spends the summer, he scatters 
U||the seed which the winter rains and snows will fertilise, 
U||and marks the extent of his temporary holding with a 
U||pattern of stones which no other tribesman will venture 
U||to disturb before the sower returns in the spring to 
U||gather in his harvest. Light-hearted and cheerful in 
U||spite of the severe struggle which he is constantly 
U||waging for sheer existence, the Bakhtiari is, however, 
U||prompt to wrath, and out of some hasty and insignificant 
U||quarrel blood feuds arise which involve whole families 
U||and clans in destructive enmity. 
U||It is mainly owing to the frequency and bitterness of 
U||such feuds, especially amongst the leading members 
U||of the ruling clans, that the Persian Government is 
U||able to maintain some semblance of authority over the 
U||Bakhtiaris. At times their independence has been well- 
U||nigh absolute ; they have even more than once threatened 
U||to overthrow the power of the Shahj on one occasion 
U||they actually placed a puppet of their own on the throne 
U||at Isfahan. But, in the long run, the superior diplomacy 
U||of the rulers of Persia, coupled with unparalleled 
U||treachery, has always asserted itself, and it has always, 
U||it must be confessed, found willing and efficient tools 
U||amongst the Bakhtiaris themselves. As one of the 
U||chiefs remarked sixty years ago to Layard, after Mu- 
U||hammed Taki Khan had been betrayed into the cruel 
U||hands of the Motemed-ed-Dowleh, I will tell you the 
U||truth, Sahib. We Bakhtiaris are all fools. So long 
U||as we are powerful and strong, and do not fear the 
U||IS4 the highland tribesmen of PERSIA 
U||Persians, we must needs be at enmity amongst our- 
U||selves and seek each others’ lives. Were we but united, 
U||these mountains would never be trodden by those dogs 
U||of Turks” — the ruling dynasty in Persia is of Turkestan 
U||origin — “for they are women, not men,” Some of the 
U||ablest Persian rulers of the past have realised that a 
U||great warlike tribe, such as the Bakhtiaris, if properly 
U||handled, might be a bulwark of strength for their 
U||Empire. The present dynasty is incapable of such states- 
U||manlike conceptions, and none has practised greater 
U||perfidy and cruelty in its dealings with the tribes, or 
U||played with greater skill upon their internal jealousies 
U||and dissensions. At K[ahv-i-Rukh, his summer resi- 
U||dence, on a well-watered plateau high up in the moun- 
U||tains, I was the guest of the Serdar Isfendiar Khan, 
U||the head of the Haft Lang clan and supreme chief or 
U||Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari tribes, a grave and rather sad- 
U||looking man of fifty-two, whose father was treacherously 
U||murdered by the Zill-es-SuItan under orders from Te- 
U||heran, Isfendiar himself was spared, but for six years 
U||afterwards he remained a state prisoner. When the Zill 
U||fell into disgrace with the late Shah in i888 it suited 
U||Teheran to affect disapproval of his policy towards 
U||the Bakhtiaris, and Isfendiar Khan was at least out- 
U||wardly restored to favour, first as Ilbegi and then as 
U||Ilkhani of the tribes. The Bakhtiaris who owned 
U||allegiance to him numbered, according to his estimate, 
U||upwards of 250,000 souls, capable of placing 70,000 
U||fighting men in the field, and, as the Arab tribes of 
U||the lowlands were subject to his influence, and Sheikh 
U||Khazzal of Muhammerah, who controls the great Kaab 
U||clan in the estuary of the Shatt-el-Arab, was his very 
U||good friend, his authority could be said to extend from 
U||the western borders of the provinces of Isfahan and 
U||A FALLEN CLAN 
U||155 
U||Pars to the frontiers of Turkish Arabia. To his own 
U||people his word was law, and nothing perhaps afforded 
U||a better illustration of the implicit obedience he com- 
U||manded than the acquiescence of the tribes in the pro- 
U||hibition he had recently enacted of the use of tea 
U||and sugar, the excessive consumption of these Persian 
U||luxuries being in his opinion a needless extravagance 
U||and tending towards Persian effeminacy. Yet, great 
U||as his power was over the tribesmen, the history of his 
U||family, as well as his own experience, was there to 
U||teach him how manifold are the dangers that beset such 
U||as him, both from the wiles of the Persians and from 
U||the jealousy of his own kinsmen. A few days after my 
U||visit to Kahv-i-Rukh I passed through Kalaat Tul, 
U||where the great grandson of Muhammed Taki Khan still 
U||lives in the castle which his great ancestor built when 
U||he raised the Chahr Lang clan to the premiership of 
U||the Bakhtiari tribes, but the stronghold in which he 
U||entertained Layard is dismantled and ruinous, and his 
U||descendants can barely eke out a penurious existence 
U||from the remnants of his great estates. Though the 
U||fortunes of the Haft Lang were built up on the ruins 
U||of the Chahr Lang, the Ilkhani could not but realise 
U||that the power of the Bakhtiaris had never recovered 
U||from the blow dealt to it when Muhammed Taki was 
U||carried off a prisoner to Teheran ; and that even in his 
U||own branch of the clan the dissensions which brought 
U||about the downfall of so many of his predecessors 
U||are only slumbering, and may be quickened at any 
U||moment under the sinister influence of Persian in- 
U||trigues. Isfendiar Khan was ill when I saw him, and 
U||he died in June, 1903. What will be the consequences 
U||of his death to his own people it is yet too early to 
U||say, but it cannot fail to increase the apprehensions 
U||iS6 THE HIGHLAND TRIBESMEN OF PERSIA 
U||which already existed amongst them of troublous times 
U||to come. 
U||Almost from the first days when our influence began 
U||to make itself felt in Persia the Bakhtiaris have looked 
U||instinctively to England for protection, and we have 
U||generally sought to cultivate friendly relations with 
U||them, so far as we could do so without arousing the 
U||susceptibilities of the Central Government. It was 
U||mainly to secure our goodwill that the Bakhtiari chiefs 
U||agreed to construct and protect a caravan route through 
U||their mountains. They are in many respects more open 
U||to progressive ideas than the average Persian official, 
U||and they value not only the direct profit they them- 
U||selves derive from the road in the shape of tolls, but 
U||also the indirect benefits it has conferred upon their 
U||people. For with the growth of traffic cultivation has 
U||extended along the road in a very remarkable degree, 
U||and the tribesmen are beginning to find a ready market 
U||for produce which they had never before dreamt of 
U||raising. It is much to be regretted that in these cir- 
U||cumstances a misunderstanding should have arisen 
U||between the chiefs and Messrs. Lynch as to payment 
U||for the construction of the road. The expenditure in- 
U||curred by Messrs. Lynch— and it must be remembered 
U||that they agreed to construct the road merely as agents 
U||for the chiefs without making a farthing of profit for 
U||themselves— has unfortunately considerably exceeded 
U||the original estimates, chiefly owing to the unexpected 
U||cost of the two suspension bridges ; but the chiefs refuse 
U||to consider themselves bound to anything beyond the 
U||estimates, and, so far, though they have levied the tolls, 
U||they have paid neither capital nor interest, as Messrs. 
U||Lynch naturally decline to give them a full discharge 
U||against payment of only part of the expenditure they 
U||BAKHTIARI GRIEVANCES 
U||IS7 
U||have actually incurred. Yet the tolls represent a hand- 
U||some income on the small cost of the road, which 
U||amounted only to about ;6^8,5oo. In 1902 the tolls 
U||levied by the chiefs on the through traffic amounted to 
U||nearly ;^500, and the tolls they levy upon local traffic 
U||from their own tribesmen must have amounted to a 
U||much more considerable sum, as in 1901 they were 
U||farmed out for over ;£■ 1,500. But the Bakhtiari chiefs 
U||would probably have been less reluctant to discharge 
U||their obligations if the primary object for which they 
U||agreed to open up the mountains they had hitherto 
U||so jealously guarded against all comers had not been 
U||disappointed. Rightly or wrongly, they imagine that, 
U||far from having secured thereby the goodwill of the 
U||British Legation to whose urgency they yielded, they 
U||can no longer rely upon its friendly offices even to the 
U||same limited extent as in the past. It is not only that 
U||from recent personal incidents, of which they perhaps 
U||exaggerate the importance, they have gathered the 
U||impression that they are looked upon now as somewhat 
U||compromising clients to whom we can no longer afford 
U||to lend our patronage. Being shrewd observers, they 
U||note and draw their own conclusions from the singular 
U||phenomenon that in proportion as the Teheran Govern- 
U||ment is becoming a mere tool in the hands of Russia, 
U||our readiness to strengthen it by favouring its centralis- 
U||ing policy at home seems to increase. At any time 
U||during the last century we might have paralysed the 
U||power of the Central Government in Southern Persia 
U||by encouraging the various elements of disaffection 
U||which have ever yielded reluctant allegiance to Teheran. 
U||We preferred to adopt an opposite policy, and on more 
U||than one occasion we actually encouraged, not only the 
U||consolidation, but the extension of Persian rule, in the 
U||158 THE HIGHLAND TRIBESMEN OF PERSIA 
U||belief that a strong Persia would also be a friendly 
U||Persia. Even the significant developments of the last 
U||few years do not appear to have cured us of that 
U||delusion, and we still seem disposed to countenance 
U||the policy of centralisation by which her rulers look to 
U||regain at home some of the prestige they have lost 
U||abroad. That Russia should encourage such a policy 
U||is natural enough, and she is only doing in Persia 
U||what she does in China and in Turkey. So long as the 
U||Central Government is sufficiently subservient to her 
U||purpose she is quite willing to let it have a free hand 
U||in all non-essentials, especially in matters of internal 
U||administration. 
U||That Russia is herself beginning to take an active 
U||interest in the affairs of the Bakhtiaris is by no means 
U||calculated to reassure them. There have been mys- 
U||terious comings and goings of Russian Consuls and 
U||Russian officers in the Bakhtiari mountains, and not 
U||only have the demands of Teheran for benevolences ” 
U||from the Bakhtiari chiefs grown more exacting, but 
U||already last year rumour was rife that the Persian 
U||Government meant to take an early opportunity of 
U||removing the Ilkhani, who had always openly professed 
U||himself a friend of the English, and who built roads 
U||for the benefit of their trade. That Russian influence 
U||should become a factor in the tribal politics of the 
U||Bakhtiaris is an entirely novel feature in the situation. 
U||In their traditional detestation of Persian rule, the 
U||Bakhtiaris have been accustomed hitherto to place their 
U||hopes in the ultimate support of England, because 
U||Englishmen are the only foreigners who have cultivated 
U||friendly relations with them. But they would very 
U||soon learn to turn their eyes towards Russia if her 
U||ascendency were once brought home to them ; and 
U||THE DESCENT TO THE GULF 
U||159 
U||though it may suit Russia to pose for the time being as 
U||the champion of the Shah’s authority, she is much too 
U||shrewd to identify her influence permanently with such 
U||a hateful formula, or to allow such a splendid material 
U||as the Bakhtiari tribesmen to be wasted and debased by 
U||Persian methods. Early In the last century, during 
U||the great Napoleonic wars, Persia was induced to com- 
U||mit for a time to British officers the thankless task 
U||of reorganising her army. Of the force which they 
U||created none was more efficient and loyal to its British 
U||commanders than a body of 3,000 Bakhtiaris raised with 
U||the consent of the chieftains. In the hands of a born 
U||leader of men like General Kosagowsky the Bakhtiaris 
U||would furnish an army which would soon secure to 
U||Russia all over Southern Persia down to the Gulf the 
U||same, and more than the same, ascendency she already 
U||enjoys in the North. That a body of 100 Bakhtiari 
U||tribesmen under one of their own chiefs has lately been 
U||attached to the Cossack Brigade at Teheran is, to say 
U||the least, a noteworthy symptom. 
U||From the ridge of the Mungasht, the most southerly 
U||of the lofty ranges that enclose the summer haunts of 
U||the Bakhtiaris, the mountains fall away in a succession 
U||of spacious upland terraces leading down in turn by a 
U||series of steep descents to the great alluvial lowlands. 
U||From the edge of the last of these terraces, supported 
U||by serried buttresses which form a natural retaining 
U||wall 600 or 700 feet high, the eye ranges over an 
U||apparently boundless plain, stretching away for a hun- 
U||dred miles due south to the head of the Persian Gulf, 
U||and south-east across the Karun to the great Mesopo- 
U||tamian delta. In November there Is little to break the 
U||yellow-and-brown monotony of this vast expanse, save 
U||the dark tents of Arab nomads and the wattle huts of 
U||i6o THE HIGHLAND TRIBESMEN OF PERSIA 
U||occasional villages clustered round a few wells of more 
U||or less brackish water. For in the rare patches of 
U||cultivation the summer crops have long since been 
U||garnered, and the grass has everywhere been eaten 
U||down to the ground by the roaming herds and flocks. 
U||Yet it only requires a few days’ beneficent rain to con- 
U||vert this plain into a great succulent pasture land, and 
U||as the first autumnal storms had just swept up from the 
U||Gulf, we found, before we reached Ahwaz, tender 
U||shoots of green already bursting forth from the sodden 
U||soil under the compehi:x:g force of the fierce sunshine, 
U||and we met troops of Arabs — men, women, and chil- 
U||dren— sallying forth from the villages on the banks of 
U||the Karun to sow their winter crops and pick out fresh 
U||pasturages in their accustomed haunts. A little later 
U||in the year the Bakhtiaris descend from their mountains 
U||to share the plain with the Arabs, but they had not yet 
U||reached the lowlands, and we seemed to have dropped 
U||suddenly into a purely Arab country. The harsh 
U||guttural tongue, always voluble and strident, the strong 
U||Semitic type, even the coif of yellow silk, bound round 
U||the head with a twist of black camel-hair wool, showed 
U||that, though still nominally in Persia, we had already 
U||passed into the land of the Arab, where the untutored 
U||son of Ishmael still roams at large, yielding, outside 
U||the towns, but scant allegiance to any master, Turk or 
U||Persian, from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the out- 
U||skirts of Damascus and Aleppo. 
U||AMONGST THE ARABS OF THE PLAINS 
U||CHAPTER XV 
U||THE KARUN TRADE ROUTE 
U||N O one who remembers the flourish of trumpets 
U||with which the opening of the Karun river to 
U||navigation was announced in 1888 can well repress a 
U||smile at the exiguous results which have hitherto 
U||attended that effort of British diplomacy. It is not 
U||that anything has happened to diminish the value of 
U||the Karun, or that those who undertook to act as the 
U||pioneers of navigation on its waters have lacked enter- 
U||prise or perseverance. The fiercer the competition to 
U||which British trade is being subjected in Northern 
U||Persia under the politico-economic pressure of Russia, 
U||the more important it becomes for us to develop the 
U||easiest and cheapest means of access to the Persian 
U||markets of the interior from the South. The recent 
U||formation of a new British company which is to take 
U||over the road rights of the Imperial Bank of Persia 
U||may be taken as an indication that we are beginning to 
U||appreciate the fact that the Karun must be our chief 
U||base of operations from the South. It may be hoped 
U||that before long a carriage-road from Isfahan to Kashan 
U||and Kum, connecting with the Kum-Teheran road 
U||which the Imperial Bank constructed a few years ago, 
U||will materially facilitate traffic between the Karun and 
U||the capital. The material difficulties to be overcome 
U||i 62 
U||THE KARUN TRADE ROUTE 
U||are certainly not formidable. The Persian Trading 
U||and Transport Company” has also acquired the right 
U||to open up a new road from Shuster on the upper 
U||Karun through the Dizful valley to Khorumabad 
U||and Burujird, connecting thence through Sultanabad 
U||with the carriage-road for which the Imperial Bank 
U||had also acquired a concession from the Persian 
U||Government. On this route the difficulties are likely 
U||to be greater, as it will have to be carried through the 
U||turbulent country of the Lurs, but there is no reason 
U||why the methods which have proved successful with 
U||the Bakhtiaris, who are themselves an offshoot of the 
U||Lur tribes, should not be equally successful with the 
U||nomads of Luristan proper. In any case, the navigation 
U||of the Karun will have to receive a little more attention 
U||at the hands of British diplomacy than it has had during 
U||the greater part of the last fifteen years. So far we seem 
U||never to have quite realised that it is one thing to obtain 
U||the promulgation of a Persian Firman and another to 
U||secure its execution. A brief summary of the difficulties 
U||with which British enterprise on the Karun has had to 
U||contend possesses from this point of view more than a 
U||merely retrospective interest. 
U||Even the most unprogressive of Chinese Mandarins 
U||might learn something from Persian Mandarins in the 
U||matter of obstruction and bad faith. Within a few 
U||weeks of the promulgation of the Firman the Persian 
U||Government elaborated a series of regulations concern- 
U||ing the navigation of the Karun, which were obviously 
U||intended to defeat as far as possible the objects of the 
U||concession. It was ruled that no foreigner could 
U||purchase, hold, or mortgage property on the Karun, al- 
U||though the Treaty of Turkman Chai, of which we share 
U||the benefits under our most- favoured- nation clause, 
U||PERSIAN OBSTRUCTION 163 
U||gives foreign merchants the right to purchase property 
U||sufficient for a dwelling-house, with warehouses and 
U||business premises. The Persian Government, on the 
U||other hand, declared that it would itself undertake the 
U||construction of such buildings, and lease them to 
U||foreigners trading on the Karun. It was further 
U||enacted that the banks and course of the river were 
U||not to be interfered with in anyway. These regulations 
U||were blandly accepted by the British Minister. The 
U||result was that when Messrs. Lynch Brothers, who had 
U||already placed their steamers on the river at the 
U||invitation of the British Government and on the faith 
U||of the Shah’s Firman, claimed their right under the 
U||Turkman Chai Treaty to purchase land at Ahwaz for 
U||the erection of the necessary business premises, they 
U||were met with a categorical refusal on the part of the 
U||Persian authorities, who took their stand on the 
U||Karun regulations ” ; and their refusal was upheld 
U||by the British Legation. At the same time, having 
U||learnt from Messrs. Lynch’s agent, under cover of a 
U||friendly consultation, what that firm proposed to do 
U||in order to promote navigation on the river, the Persian 
U||Governor-General of Arabistan hastened to secure from 
U||Teheran an exclusive concession in favour of one of his 
U||creatures, the Moyun-i-Tujarof Bushire, for the whole of 
U||the scheme, which embraced the construction of a wharf 
U||and business premises at Ahwaz, the establishment of a 
U||portage tramway round the rapids above Ahwaz, and 
U||the placing of a special steamer on the upper reach of 
U||the river between Ahwaz and Shuster. Thus when 
U||Messrs. Lynch, finding themselves deprived of their 
U||treaty rights to buy land at Ahwaz, fell back upon 
U||the Persian Government’s own undertaking to provide 
U||the necessary premises, the latter entrenched themselves 
U||164 
U||THE KARUN TRADE ROUTE 
U||behind the concession they had granted to the Moyun. 
U||For nearly three years Messrs. Lynch, failing to obtain 
U||any redress, tried to negotiate with that individual, 
U||whose terms were, however, so exorbitant that an 
U||agreement proved impossible, and in the meantime 
U||their agent at Ahwaz was charged 500 krans a month 
U||(at the then rate of exchange about ;^’i5o per annum) 
U||for the rent of an old mat-shed which the Persian 
U||authorities had graciously assigned to him as his 
U||residence and business premises. It was not until 
U||1894 that the Persian Government were induced to 
U||appoint an agent empowered to carry out their engage- 
U||ments, and a lease signed for the premises which 
U||Messrs. Lynch now occupy. Even this lease, however, 
U||can hardly be said to give them either fixity of tenure or 
U||immunity from vexation, for already the Persians, who 
U||drafted it themselves, have endeavoured to place upon 
U||it their own arbitrary interpretation. As for the tram- 
U||way round the rapids between the lower and upper 
U||reaches of the river, the Moyun has made good his 
U||monopoly, and the only safeguard against absolutely 
U||prohibitive charges for the portage of goods is the 
U||competition of mule carriage, which the Persian authori- 
U||ties have tried, hitherto unsuccessfully, to defeat by in- 
U||timidating the muleteers. The navigation of the Upper 
U||Karun between Ahwaz and Shuster is carried on 
U||under conditions even more characteristically Persian. 
U||Messrs. Lynch had to present the Shah with a steamer 
U||and then to run it on his account. One might imagine 
U||that, navigation having been placed under such exalted 
U||auspices, there would have been less obstruction. On 
U||the contrary. Up to the present day Messrs. Lynch 
U||have failed to secure any kind of premises for storing 
U||cargo at Shuster, or even the most elementary facilities 
U||OFFICIAL SPECULATION 165 
U||for loading and unloading. Trading under such con- 
U||ditions is bound to be unprofitable, but the Shah’s 
U||Government bears the loss stoically, for the simple 
U||reason that it leaves Messrs. Lynch to meet the deficit. 
U||So far it has not paid a single penny towards balancing 
U||its account, and has, apparently, no intention of doing 
U||so. Anything in the shape of a river conservancy is, 
U||of course, unknown in Persia, and the clause of the 
U||“ Karun regulations” providing against interference 
U||with the shores or the course of the river serves no 
U||other purpose than to prevent the removal, however 
U||urgent, of natural obstructions to navigation. In fact, 
U||the only clause of the ‘^Karun regulations” which the 
U||Persians have honestly observed is that which authorises 
U||them to raise a due of one kran on every ton of cargo 
U||carried. 
U||But mere obstruction for obstruction’s sake, though it 
U||may have its fascination, is not the game which appeals 
U||most to the Persian official. There are other forms 
U||which possess the more substantial attraction of bring- 
U||ing grist to his own mill. The plains watered by the 
U||Karun are capable of becoming one of the granaries 
U||of the world. Even under their present rulers they 
U||yield a bountiful harvest whenever there is an abundant 
U||rainfall, and the export of wheat in good seasons was 
U||an important feature in the estimates of future traffic on 
U||the river. These estimates the Persian authorities have 
U||done their best to upset by the simple process of enact- 
U||ing arbitrary prohibitions against the exportation of 
U||foodstuffs. Persian officials are adepts in the art of 
U||engineering corners in grain for their own personal 
U||benefit, and, by stopping the export, they practically 
U||compel the producer to sell his produce to them on 
U||their own terms. It is a lucrative business, in which 
U||i66 
U||THE KARUN TRADE ROUTE 
U||the Shah’s Ministers in Teheran do not scruple to 
U||take a hand, and there is always a famine in some 
U||part of the empire which can serve as a colourable 
U||pretext for the prohibition, though, in the present state 
U||of communications and with the present cost of trans- 
U||port, an embargo on the exportation of grain from 
U||Muhammerah can no more relieve a famine in Khora- 
U||san, or even in Isfahan, than in Timbuktu. 
U||The following incident may serve as an illustration. 
U||In June, igoo, there came as a pleasant surprise to the 
U||British merchants at Muhammerah, who had grown 
U||weary of making fruitless representations, an official 
U||notification from the British Legation at Teheran that 
U||the Persian Government had removed the embargo on 
U||the exportation of wheat from the ports of Southern 
U||Persia. They thereupon proceeded to purchase grain 
U||from the natives up the Karun, who were immediately 
U||thrashed for their pains by the local authorities at 
U||Ahwaz. This was reported to Teheran, and inquiry 
U||made as to the apparent exclusion of Muhammerah 
U||from the removal of the embargo. The answer promptly 
U||came that Muhammerah was not excluded, and that 
U||within ten days categorical orders would be received 
U||by all the local officials which would avert further 
U||difficulties. On the faith of this definite statement 
U||purchases of 'grain were executed on a larger scale, 
U||and heavy payments made on account. But week after 
U||week elapsed, no orders were received, and the local 
U||officials refused to allow the grain purchased from the 
U||peasantry to be removed. At the end of August the 
U||Legation had to admit that a hitch had occurred, and 
U||intimated that the best way to secure a settlement would 
U||probably be for the interested parties to negotiate 
U||direct with the Governor-General of Arabistan, who 
U||A SUCCESSFUL “SQUEEZE” 
U||167 
U||was the chief obstructionist, and, in the absence of 
U||the Shah then in Europe, refused, it was alleged, to 
U||comply with the orders sent to him from Teheran. 
U||This suggestion was utterly impracticable, for the 
U||Governor-General of Arabistan resided at Burujird, 
U||about a fortnight’s journey from Shuster, and com- 
U||munications in that part of the country are always 
U||notoriously precarious and unsafe. Meanwhile the 
U||local authorities, who refused to allow the British 
U||purchaser to remove the grain, were actually pressing 
U||him on behalf of the producer to complete payment of 
U||the purchase-money. In these circumstances the only 
U||course left to the purchaser was to try and get rid of 
U||his grain as best he could in the local market. Be- 
U||sides this, he had to cancel all arrangements made 
U||for transport, freight, etc. When this was done, and 
U||the Governor-General of Arabistan and his friends in 
U||Teheran had been in due course apprised by their local 
U||agents of the successful termination of the ‘‘squeeze,” 
U||the comedy was completed by an official communica- 
U||tion from the Persian Government to H.M. Legation, 
U||stating that as far as purchases had been already made 
U||by British merchants, imperative orders had now been 
U||sent to allow the produce to be exported, and the 
U||Legation was able to announce with no little self- 
U||complacency that its untiring efforts had at last been 
U||rewarded. The unconscious humour of this announce- 
U||ment was doubtless not lost upon the interested parties 
U||in Muhammerah, who had had to write off their losses 
U||before the announcement reached them. 
U||It says a good deal for British pluck that it should 
U||have held out on the Karun for so many years in the 
U||face of such discouraging conditions, for the small 
U||annual compensation for loss which was granted by 
U||i68 
U||THE KARUN TRADE ROUTE 
U||the British and Indian Governments to encourage 
U||Messrs. Lynch to continue their pioneer work has 
U||failed, I understand, to cover even the deficit on the 
U||navigation of the river between Muhammerah and 
U||Ahwaz, not to speak of the debt contracted towards 
U||them by the Shah’s Government in connection with the 
U||navigation of the upper reach between Ahwaz and 
U||Shuster. Though at an entirely disproportionate cost of 
U||both money and energy, steady progress has, neverthe- 
U||less, been made. The foreign trade of the Karun, which 
U||was estimated at barely ;.^i6,ooo in 1891, represented in 
U||1902 a total value of ;^27 1,732, in spite of severe 
U||temporary depression due to bad harvests and other 
U||adverse influences; and the foreign shipping of the 
U||port of Muhammerah has increased within the same 
U||period from 135,000 to over 240,000 tons, whereof 95 
U||per cent, is British. The population of Muhammerah 
U||has grown from about 2,500 to over 7,000, and at 
U||Ahwaz an entirely new settlement has sprung up called 
U||Bunder Nasri, just below the rapids, at the terminus of 
U||river navigation on the lower reach. These are, no 
U||doubt, small beginnings, but if one takes into account 
U||the enormous difficulties to be contended with, they are 
U||far from discouraging. Yet, at the very moment when 
U||a fresh impetus was being given to the Karun trade by 
U||the prospect of, improved means of communication with 
U||the inland markets, the Persian Government threatened 
U||to deal it a fresh and very serious blow. 
U||By a stroke of the pen and without a word of warning 
U||the new Belgian administration of the Persian Customs 
U||attempted in the autumn of 1902 to revolutionise the 
U||whole Customs system of the Karun district. After 
U||the river was opened to navigation in 1888 the collec- 
U||tion of Customs dues was consolidated at three different 
U||ARBITRARY PROCEEDINGS 
U||169 
U||stations — Muhammerah, Ahwaz, and Shuster. Goods 
U||could thus be despatched on through bills of lading to 
U||or from any one of these three ports, where the import 
U||or export dues, as the case might be, were respectively 
U||paid. Native merchants at Shuster and Ahwaz attach 
U||special value to this arrangement, which was almost 
U||the only practical concession ever made by the Persian 
U||authorities to the trading interests of the Karun. In 
U||1890, when Messrs. Lynch came to an agreement with 
U||the Shah’s Government for running the steamer, which 
U||they presented to his Majesty, on the upper reach of 
U||the river, they were careful to include the maintenance 
U||of the three Customs stations as one of the condi- 
U||tions of that agreement, and the pledge then given 
U||by the Amin-es-Sultaneh, now the Atabeg-Azam, 
U||who was then Prime Minister, was embodied in 
U||an official memorandum drawn up by Sir Henry 
U||Drummond Wolff, under date of February 14th, 1890. 
U||The action of the new Belgian administration of 
U||Customs, therefore, not only interfered abruptly with 
U||established usage, but was a deliberate violation of 
U||specific engagements contracted by the Persian Govern- 
U||ment. No official intimation of any kind was given 
U||that such action was contemplated. The Customs 
U||stations at Shuster and Ahwaz were closed, and goods 
U||consigned to those ports were detained arbitrarily in 
U||Muhammerah pending payment of import duties at 
U||that port, where the carriers had, of course, no authority 
U||to pay them, and where neither the shippers nor the 
U||consignees had in most cases any agents. In the same 
U||way goods despatched from those ports on through 
U||bills of lading were detained at Muhammerah because 
U||there was no longer anyone qualified to receive pay- 
U||ment of the export dues tendered to the Persian authori- 
U||170 
U||THE KARUN TRADE ROUTE 
U||ties at the place of origin, and there was no one who 
U||could pay them at Muhammerah. For more than a 
U||month a complete deadlock ensued, and though a modus 
U||vivendz "was established with regard to the goods actually 
U||detained in transit, very strong pressure had to be 
U||applied to secure the material interests of the Karun 
U||trade permanently against the arbitrary action of the 
U||new Customs administration. 
U||But the issue was not merely a commercial one. For 
U||at Muhammerah, as in all the Persian ports of the Gulf, 
U||the establishment of the new Customs administration 
U||is regarded as forming part of a comprehensive policy 
U||of centralisation upon which Teheran has entered at 
U||the instigation of Russia. Hitherto the Customs 
U||administration had been left practically in the hands of 
U||the local authorities, who levied them or farmed them 
U||out on their own account, often making merely such 
U||periodical remittances to the Shah’s Treasury as were 
U||necessary to avoid acute trouble with the central 
U||Government. This system led, no doubt, to grave 
U||abuses, the tax-farmer of one port not infrequently 
U||competing with his neighbours at the expense of the 
U||Treasury by offering importers a largely reduced tariff. 
U||The looser the administrative ties which bound the 
U||local authorities to the central Government the larger 
U||was the liberty or licence they enjoyed with regard to 
U||the Customs, In Muhammerah especially the authority 
U||wielded by Sheikh Khazzal, who controls the great 
U||Kaab tribes of the Karun and the Shatt-el-Arab, has 
U||been rather that of a semi-independent vassal than of 
U||a mere governor appointed by the Shah. The intro- 
U||duction of a highly centralised administration directly 
U||controlled from Teheran and charged with an important 
U||branch of revenue collection necessarily constitutes in 
U||the residence of sheikh khazzal on the TIGRIS 
U||Face p, 170 
U||SHEIKH KHAZZAL 
U||171 
U||his eyes, and in the eyes of the natives generally, a 
U||serious inroad upon his authority ; and, indeed, he 
U||seemed at first by no means inclined to submit to it 
U||tamely. The Arabs of South-Western Persia, like the 
U||Bakhtiaris, have always looked to British influence as 
U||a counterpoise to the centralising tendencies of Teheran, 
U||and no one, perhaps, has courted British friendship 
U||more assiduously than Sheikh Khazzal, who is just 
U||about old enough to have seen with his own eyes 
U||British gunboats steaming up the Karun and Indian 
U||sepoys in occupation of Muhammerah and Ahwaz 
U||during the Persian expedition of 1857. Had he received 
U||the slightest encouragement from us, the new Belgian 
U||administration would assuredly have had some difficulty 
U||in securing recognition at his hands, as the coercion of 
U||an Arab chief who controls powerful tribes in a country 
U||prone to lawlessness is a task upon which Teheran 
U||would not have been likely to enter lightly, especially 
U||when that chief, having wedded a Persian princess, has 
U||made friends unto himself at Court. If, moreover, he 
U||was aware that the establishment of a Belgian adminis- 
U||tration of the Customs, not only at Muhammerah, but 
U||at all the Gulf ports, might well be regarded as a viola- 
U||tion of the engagement into which the Persian Govern- 
U||ment had entered not to place the Customs of Southern 
U||Persian under foreign superintendence, he was, perhaps, 
U||entitled to expect our support. Our only reply, how- 
U||ever, was that he had better come to an amicable 
U||arrangement with the Belgians. This he has done, 
U||and the arrangement is not pecuniarily disadvantageous 
U||to him ; but whether our advice was palatable is another 
U||question. The conclusions he has drawn from it are 
U||certainly not flattering to those who gave it. Whereas 
U||formerly no foreign influence of any kind except that 
U||172 
U||THE KARUN TRADE ROUTE 
U||of England was visible in Southern Persia, the adminis- 
U||tration which most directly affects even our commercial 
U||interests has been delivered up to be controlled by a 
U||foreign influence which not only is not English, but 
U||is practically, if not avowedly, anti-English. That 
U||England should have tolerated such an innovation if 
U||she were able to prevent it is inconceivable to the 
U||native mind. That the reorganisation of the Customs 
U||is an internal reform within the rights of the Persian 
U||Government, and that the choice of Belgian officials to 
U||carry it out has been prompted by the desire to avoid 
U||provoking international jealousies, are official arguments 
U||which equally fail to impress the native. He takes 
U||stock only of what are to him the bed-rock facts, that 
U||Persia has pledged her Customs revenues to Russia 
U||and that the Belgians are merely acting as revenue 
U||collectors on behalf of Russia. If he is told that the 
U||Customs revenues of the Persian Gulf have been 
U||specially excluded from the bond he is apt to smile, or 
U||to inquire pointedly why Russia insisted that Persia 
U||should at once repay out of the Russian loans the debt 
U||which a few years ago assigned the customs of the 
U||Persian Gulf as security to England to the Imperial 
U||Bank of Persia). He knows, too, that such a vigorous 
U||measure of centralisation as the reorganisation of the 
U||Customs under the direct control of Teheran is one 
U||from which the nerveless hands of his rulers would 
U||have flinched had they not been braced up to it by 
U||strong pressure from outside. Fecit cut prodest; so the 
U||establishment of a new administration as antagonistic 
U||as the Belgian Customs have shown themselves to be, 
U||at least in the South, to the interests of British trade is, 
U||not perhaps unreasonably, looked upon as one of the 
U||many signs of the times ; like the creation of Russian 
U||RUSSIAN ACTIVITY 
U||173 
U||Consulates — including a new Russian Consulate- 
U||General at Ahwaz, where Russian interests are at 
U||present absolutely nil — the journeyings of Russian 
U||agents, the cruises of Russian men-of-war, the ventures 
U||of Russian trading vessels, which, in the Persian Gulf 
U||as elsewhere, all point to the new star of ascendency 
U||rising in the North. 
U||CHAPTER XVI 
U||TURKISH ARABISTAN 
U||I N spite of the frontiers which politically divide 
U||Persian from Turkish Arabistan— frontiers of which 
U||Turkey, at any rate, does her best to bring home the 
U||reality to all concerned by the most absurd and onerous 
U||quarantine regulations — the great alluvial plains which 
U||stretch from the Bakhtiari mountains across the Karun, 
U||the Tigris, and the Euphrates towards the Arabian 
U||peninsula form physically and ethnically so homo- 
U||geneous a whole that the present artificial lines of 
U||severance cannot be expected to outlive the precarious 
U||tenure upon which their titular owners still hold them. 
U||The disappearance of the two decadent Oriental 
U||Monarchies that have so long misgoverned one of the 
U||most fertile tracts of land in the whole world must be 
U||but a question of time. The Turk and the Persian are 
U||both aliens in the land, equally hated by the Arab 
U||population, and both have proved equally unworthy 
U||and incompetent stewards of a splendid estate, though 
U||Turkish administration in these distant provinces, far 
U||removed, on the one hand, from the blighting in- 
U||fluence of Constantinople and fairly accessible, on 
U||the other, to the restraining influence of British gun- 
U||boats, compares in many ways favourably with Persian 
U||administration. There is little or no probability of the 
U||174 
U||THE CHESNEY EXPEDITION 
U||175 
U||Arabs developing any of the qualities which entitle 
U||or enable a people to govern themselves, and, with the 
U||pressure which is now driving civilised nations to grasp 
U||in every direction at new opportunities of remunerative 
U||expansion, it is equally improbable that one of the 
U||historic granaries of the world, which, moreover, lies 
U||athwart a main artery of communication between 
U||Europe and the East, will be allowed indefinitely to 
U||lie all but fallow in the hands of its present thriftless 
U||possessors. 
U||More than half a century ago there was a time when 
U||we seemed ready to realise the importance of this 
U||region. With no natural boundaries to landward, 
U||until one reaches the great mountain system which 
U||stretches across Southern Persia from the borders of 
U||Afghanistan to the highlands of Kurdistan, and easily 
U||accessible from the sea by extensive inland waterways, 
U||the basin of the Tigris and the Euphrates offered every 
U||inducement to the enterprise of a nation commanding 
U||the seas and already holding a dominant position in 
U||Southern Asia. The British Resident at Baghdad 
U||in the days of Taylor and Rawlinson was the most 
U||powerful personage in the country, and a determined 
U||and consistent effort on our part might have restored 
U||the ancient prosperity of Mesopotamia for the benefit 
U||of our Indian Empire and of ourselves as well as of 
U||Turkey. But the national interest which was then 
U||taken in such enterprises as the Chesney expedition 
U||on the Euphrates was excited mainly by the prospect 
U||of opening up a through route to India for which the 
U||time was perhaps not yet ripe, and relatively little 
U||account was taken of the value of these regions in 
U||themselves, either as an outlet for our commerce or as 
U||a field of emigration for the surplus millions of our 
U||176 
U||TURKISH ARABISTAN 
U||Indian population. Yet though we lacked the foresight 
U||to seize at the flood the tide which has long since 
U||ebbed, the interests we still possess are much too im- 
U||portant to be allowed to drift helplessly at the mercy 
U||of impending changes which it probably no longer 
U||lies with us to avert. 
U||In 1878 the British Resident at Baghdad wrote : — 
U||‘‘ I feel I cannot too strongly urge the subject on the 
U||attention of the Government, as I am sure in my own 
U||mind that there are influences at work which will some 
U||day lose us the privilege we may honestly and fairly 
U||claim at the hands of the Turkish Government for the 
U||fostering care we have taken of its trade by our having 
U||been for fifty-eight years the conservators of the public 
U||peace in the Persian Gulf, by our surveys of its shores, 
U||a work accomplished by the officers of the late Indian 
U||Navy at great trouble, expense, and sacrifice of life, 
U||and the general relations we have had with all the 
U||Arab tribes on the Persian Gulf littoral.’’ 
U||The warning then given might be repeated to-day with 
U||added emphasis. Not only is Russian influence moving 
U||steadily down from the North, but a new world-power 
U||has appeared on the scene in the shape of Germany, 
U||who has taken in hand, with characteristic vigour and 
U||tenacity, the great railway scheme from which we 
U||flinched when we had exclusive command of the field. 
U||Whatever the relative value of railways and waterways 
U||for commercial purposes, it is too late for us to aspire 
U||to any exclusive command of railway enterprise in 
U||these regions, for we have now to reckon in any case 
U||with Germany. Had we simply built a railway years ago 
U||from Basra to Baghdad, instead of talking for decades 
U||about a trunk line from the Mediterranean to the Persian 
U||Gulf, we should have been in a position to impose our 
U||DIFFICULTIES OF NAVIGATION 177 
U||own terms upon her, and our commercial interests 
U||would not have been dependent upon the advantages 
U||which, as a pre-eminently maritime nation, we derive, 
U||or might derive, from water communications. But we 
U||did not do so, and, what is more, we have done little or 
U||nothing to develop or improve even the water communi- 
U||cations. Y et, as things are at present, if we are to hold 
U||our own against the competition of land-borne trade 
U||whenever the German railway is completed to Baghdad 
U||and the Persian Gulf, unless we can still secure the 
U||control of the latter section, our main hope lies in 
U||increasing, as far as possible, the facilities for our 
U||water-borne traffic. 
U||It is easy enough, no doubt, to talk at large about 
U||the cheapness of water-borne traffic all the world over 
U||as compared with land-borne traffic. But these general- 
U||isations do not apply to water-borne traffic carried on 
U||under the difficulties and restrictions it has to contend 
U||with in this part of the Turkish dominions. The navi- 
U||gation of such tortuous and wayward rivers as the 
U||Shatt-el-Arab and the Tigris is not in itself easy, and 
U||the Turks, of course, do nothing to make it easier. 
U||River conservancy is as unknown in Turkey as in 
U||Persia. The course of these streams is not only 
U||shallow and winding, but subject to heavy rises and 
U||fails, and constantly changing with the formation and 
U||disappearance of rapidly shifting sand shoals. The 
U||river journey from Basra to Baghdad is about 500 miles, 
U||and takes four to five days by steamer under favourable 
U||conditions. The distance by land is only 300 miles. 
U||Moreover, Basra lies 60 miles up the Shatt-el-Arab, 
U||and at its mouth there is a bar with barely 10 feet 
U||of water at low tide, and even at high water vessels 
U||drawing more than 16 to 18 feet of water have to dis- 
U||N 
U||178 
U||TURKISH ARABISTAN 
U||charge a portion of their cargo in lighters — always an 
U||expensive operation — before attempting to enter the 
U||river. The approaches to the river from the gulf are 
U||complicated and treacherous ; not a single light or 
U||beacon has Turkey placed at any point of the coast, 
U||and the only buoys that mark the channels are those 
U||laid down by the British India Steam Navigation Com- 
U||pany, just as the only surveys are those made by the 
U||British Navy and the Indian Marine. On the other 
U||hand, Turkey has erected forts at Fao, on the Shatt-el- 
U||Arab, about half-way between the bar and the con- 
U||fluence of the Karun, in direct violation of her treaty 
U||engagements with Persia, and if she has not yet armed 
U||them, this is solely due to the vigorous protests which 
U||the British Government has from time to time entered 
U||at Constantinople and which, as the Turks know, could 
U||be easily enforced on the spot. 
U||But great as are the natural difficulties with which 
U||water-borne traffic is handicapped, they do not form so 
U||serious an obstacle to trade as the arbitrary restrictions 
U||placed upon it by the shortsightedness or wilful ob- 
U||struction of the Turkish authorities. The Euphrates is 
U||practically closed over its whole course to foreign 
U||vessels, as is also the Tigris above Baghdad. Messrs. 
U||Lynch Brothers, who have navigated the Lower Tigris 
U||for half a century, are only allowed to employ two 
U||steamers in the trade between Basra and Baghdad, and 
U||to keep a third one laid up at Basra in reserve against 
U||accidents. A Turkish company also runs four steamers 
U||on the same line, and two more, which were ordered in 
U||England in 1902 on behalf of influential personages 
U||at Yildiz who enjoy the favour of the Sultan, have 
U||recently begun to ply for traffic. After much solicita- 
U||tion the Turkish Government now allows the Lynch 
U||CONGESTION AT BASRA 
U||179 
U||steamers to take lighters in tow for the conveyance of 
U||surplus cargo, but this paltry concession entirely fails 
U||to meet the requirements of the trade, and is actually 
U||granted only as a temporary favour to relieve the present 
U||congestion. Local shipments have often to be refused 
U||altogether and the shipments from India and Great 
U||Britain strictly limited. Nevertheless the accumulations 
U||of cargo on through shipments for forward delivery are 
U||so great that it would take nearly three months to clear 
U||off the stock piled up on the wharves at Basra, even if 
U||there were no fresh arrivals in the meantime. Freight 
U||in these circumstances is naturally very high, and it 
U||actually costs much more to forward goods from Basra 
U||to Baghdad than to bring them out from London to 
U||Basra. The heavy disabilities under which trade is 
U||thus placed do not affect our commercial interests only 
U||locally. A considerable portion of our trade with 
U||Persia — to an annual amount estimated at nearly three- 
U||quarters of a million sterling — is done through Basra 
U||and Baghdad by the caravan route to Kermanshah, 
U||Hamadan, and Teheran. This route is indeed con- 
U||sidered by many to be the most promising route for 
U||British trade into Northern Persia, but what prospect 
U||is there of developing traffic which is thus strangled at 
U||the neck ? Exploring operations were commenced last 
U||year near Khanikin, just over the Turko-Persian fron- 
U||tier, under the D’Arcy concession for opening up the 
U||naphtha wells of Southern Persia, and one of the great 
U||difficulties with which the work had to contend was the 
U||artificial congestion of traffic, under this system of ob- 
U||struction, on the route over which all the machinery, 
U||etc., had to be imported. In these circumstances it 
U||is not surprising that, as the boring to a level of 2,000 
U||feet below the surface did not show very satisfactory 
U||i8o TURKISH ARABISTAN 
U||results, and doubts had arisen as to the actual owner- 
U||ship of the soil, the boundaries of Turkey and Persia 
U||at that point never having been definitely delimitated, 
U||the concessionnaires have preferred to remove the seat 
U||of their operations to the Karun valley. 
U||The restrictions placed by the stupidity and ill-will 
U||of the Turkish authorities upon international trade are 
U||so glaring and so obviously directed against British 
U||trade that it should not be beyond the power of the 
U||British Government to insist upon their removal. The 
U||Porte is so little amenable to arguments based even 
U||on the economic interests of Turkey herself that it is 
U||not likely, I admit, to grant, of its own accord, com- 
U||plete freedom of navigation on these waters ; but when 
U||the Turks call upon us to consent to a revision of 
U||our commercial treaties, and an increase of duties on 
U||British imports, we are surely entitled to demand, in 
U||this direction also, some compensatory concession for 
U||the benefit of our own trade. It is even doubtful 
U||whether the restrictions which Turkey at present 
U||places upon the navigation of the Tigris and the 
U||Euphrates are not at variance with her existing engage- 
U||ments, Though the British Government never appear 
U||to have pressed that point, it is worth noting that one 
U||of the ablest representatives they have had at Baghdad, 
U||who had made a special study of the question, con- 
U||tended only twenty-five years ago that the Capitulations 
U||of i66i might be successfully invoked, as Article I., 
U||which has been confirmed by successive treaties to the 
U||present day, lays down ‘‘that the English nation and 
U||merchants and all other merchants sailing under the 
U||English flag, with their ships and vessels and merchan- 
U||dise of all descriptions, shall and may pass safely by 
U||sea, and go and come into our dominions without any 
U||THE EUPHRATES AND THE TIGRIS i8i 
U||the least prejudice or molestation.” He held, there- 
U||fore, that it was in conformity with the above principle 
U||that, in 1834, Sultan’s Firman was issued, authoris- 
U||ing four British steamers to navigate the Euphrates, 
U||and it is under this Firman, originally granted for the 
U||Euphrates, that by a series of diplomatic evolutions 
U||the Indian Marine retains a gunboat, the Cornet^ at 
U||Baghdad, and Messrs. Lynch ply their steamers on the 
U||Lower Tigris and the Shatt-el-Arab. 
U||Since the last of our Euphrates steamers was with- 
U||drawn in 1843 for service on the Indus little definite 
U||information has been available with regard to the possi- 
U||bilities of navigating the Euphrates. Large swamps 
U||have formed above its confluence with the Tigris, and 
U||they absorb now a considerable portion of its waters. 
U||But as the Turks are known to have run a small steamer 
U||up as far as Meskene, there is no reason to believe 
U||that the task of restoring a regular channel for naviga- 
U||tion by light -draught steamers would prove either 
U||very arduous or costly. On the Upper Tigris a 
U||small Turkish steamer has plied occasionally between 
U||Baghdad and Mosul, and the natural obstacles to navi- 
U||gation might probably be removed up to Diarbekir. 
U||If these two great rivers were thrown open without any 
U||arbitrary restrictions to the mercantile enterprise of the 
U||world — ^for we need not seek here, any more than we 
U||have done on the Karun, for any exclusive privileges — 
U||we should be in a much better position to meet the 
U||competition of any future railways from Asia Minor 
U||into Mesopotamia, not only in Basra and Baghdad, 
U||but in many other markets accessible from their upper 
U||reaches. It is hopeless to expect that the Turkish 
U||Government will ever undertake the irrigation works 
U||which alone are necessary to give a fresh meaning 
U||i 82 
U||TURKISH ARABISTAN 
U||to the tradition that the Garden of Eden was located 
U||between the Tigris and the Euphrates, but Sir William 
U||Willcocks, of Egyptian irrigation fame, has lately 
U||drawn attention to the field which lies before us there 
U||within easy reach of India with its superabundant 
U||population and its great experience of similar under- 
U||takings. British capital and British guidance would 
U||give a new stimulus and new opportunities to the 
U||industry of the people — at present quite as effectually 
U||discouraged by the difficulty of disposing of surplus 
U||produce as by the exactions of the tax-collector — and 
U||our water-borne trade with adequate facilities for ex- 
U||pansion would take its legitimate share of the returning 
U||prosperity of the country. 
U||Surely, at the present day, when British industry is 
U||clamouring for new markets under the growing pressure 
U||of universal competition, it behoves the British Govern- 
U||ment to make an effort to retain and develop the markets 
U||which we have already opened up and where our pre- 
U||dominance is still intact. The trade of Basra and 
U||Baghdad, artificially cribbed and confined as it is, is by 
U||no means insignificant. It is unnecessary to produce 
U||detailed statistics of which even the compilers are 
U||unable to guarantee the accuracy. But the value of 
U||the foreign imports as set forth in the latest Consular 
U||reports amounted to over one and a quarter million 
U||sterling in 1902, or about the same figure as in igoi, 
U||though the exports, in consequence of exceptionally 
U||bad harvests, had fallen to ;^95o,ooo from ;^i, 150,000 
U||in 1901, and ;^i, 560,000 in 1900. In one respect the 
U||foreign trade of the Tigris is on a sounder basis than 
U||the foreign trade of the Persian ports of the Gulf, for 
U||the exports bear a much more favourable proportion to 
U||the imports. The forests of date palms, which form 
U||A FIERY FURNACE 
U||183 
U||so picturesque a feature in the landscape along both 
U||banks of the Shatt-el-Arab, contribute, with cereals, 
U||the most important item of exportation, the total value 
U||of the date crop having reached upwards of ;£'35o,ooo 
U||in a good year ; and, shortsighted as is the economic 
U||policy of Turkey, her officials are not free like their 
U||Persian colleagues to interfere with the export trade by 
U||arbitrary embargoes and to engineer rings for their own 
U||private benefit. Curiously enough the foreign merchants 
U||of Basra confine themselves almost entirely to the export 
U||trade, leaving the import trade to native firms, mostly 
U||Jewish. Both the imports and the exports are, how- 
U||ever, mainly British or British Indian, and British ship- 
U||ping is equally predominant, the net tonnage of British 
U||steamers cleared at the port of Basra in 1902 amount- 
U||ing to 164,341 tons out of a total of 201,513 tons. 
U||Satisfactory as these results doubtless are, they fall 
U||deplorably short of what they might have been had 
U||British diplomacy shown a little more foresight in the 
U||past, or of what they might be now, if it displayed a 
U||little more energy in the present ; and the enterprise of 
U||a British community which braves the terrors of resi- 
U||dence in this fiery furnace, where the thermometer 
U||registers over 100° in the shade on 116 days during the 
U||year, and the mean temperature night and day for 
U||upwards of four months is about 95% certainly deserves 
U||rather more recognition than it has generally met with 
U||at the hands of those to whom its interests have been 
U||committed. One of the most acute, though not the 
U||most serious, grievances of Basra is the arbitrary and 
U||futile imposition of quarantine under orders from Con- 
U||stantinople, which is rigorously enforced against all 
U||foreigners, though any native can evade it with im- 
U||punity. Because there is plague in India or cholera in 
U||Egypt, every foreigner who has been called on business. 
U||184 
U||TURKISH ARABISTAN 
U||say, to Bushire or some other port on the Persian Gulf, 
U||has to perform quarantine either on board ship or in a 
U||miserable lazaretto on the opposite bank of the river 
U||when he returns to Basra. The native, on the other 
U||hand, leaves the ship at Muhammerah, and, subject 
U||to a carefully graduated scale of bribery, is allowed 
U||almost openly to come across the river in a native boat 
U||and land unmolested under the nose of the quarantine 
U||authorities. It is humiliating to think that even the 
U||British men-of-war engaged in policing the Gulf were 
U||fain to submit patiently to the same treatment, until 
U||one day a Russian man-of-war came up to Basra, when 
U||an emphatic protest from its commander, properly sup- 
U||ported by the Embassy at Constantinople, at once 
U||secured a substantial reduction of the term. Then 
U||and then only did we bestir ourselves, and ultimately 
U||succeeded in obtaining a further reduction. 
U||Political and commercial interests, here as elsewhere 
U||in the East, are indissolubly bound up together, and 
U||the Koweyt question, with which I must deal separately, 
U||may serve to illustrate the impossibility of dividing 
U||British interests, as some of our political mentors 
U||would apparently do, into different water-tight com- 
U||partments, which can be retained or jettisoned without 
U||mutual injury. Basra is the capital of the vilayet 
U||specially created to direct and promote the extension 
U||of Turkish influence along the shores of the Persian 
U||Gulf, and there can be little doubt that, if we had 
U||adopted a more determined attitude in defence of our 
U||commercial interests against the policy of obstruction 
U||steadily pursued by the Porte, Turkey would never 
U||have ventured to embark upon the political intrigues 
U||by which she is now seeking to undermine our in- 
U||fluence in a region where half a century ago our 
U||ascendency was unchallenged. 
U||CHAPTER XVII 
U||THE GERMAN RAILWAY INVASION OF ASIATIC 
U||TURKEY 
U||G ermany cannot yet be said to have acquired 
U||any positive status in the Middle East, In 
U||Persia she has, like other Powers, diplomatic and con- 
U||sular representatives, and in the Persian Gulf her con- 
U||suls have been displaying of late years a good deal of 
U||somewhat ostentatious activity. Her commercial rela- 
U||tions with Persia are unimportant, and so far she has 
U||had few opportunities of cultivating political relations 
U||with the Shah’s Government. It may, however, be 
U||well to note that in the Treaty of Commerce concluded 
U||between Persia and Germany in 1873, which is still in 
U||force, it is stated, under Article 19, that ‘‘in the event 
U||of Persia being involved in differences with another 
U||power, the German Imperial Government declares 
U||itself ready to employ its good offices, at the invita- 
U||tion of the Shah’s Government, with a view to promot- 
U||ing a settlement of such differences.” The German 
U||Government, we may be sure, reckons among its 
U||political assets a provision which opens up such 
U||possibilities of “honest brokerage.” It is not, how- 
U||ever, through Persia, for the present, but through 
U||Turkey that Germany is seeking to project her influence 
U||into the Middle East. Like all her other schemes of 
U||i8s 
U||i86 
U||GERMAN RAILWAY INVASION 
U||militant world-policy, this one lacks neither thorough- 
U||ness nor boldness, and as it must very largely affect our 
U||interests and especially those of India, and our co- 
U||operation has actually been invited to promote its 
U||achievement, it is a matter which it behoves us to 
U||examine with much care. Let us, in^the first place, con- 
U||sider the circumstances which have enabled Germany 
U||to compass with no mean prospect of success such great 
U||ambitions. 
U||The growth of German influence at Constantinople 
U||is one of the most remarkable political phenomena of 
U||the closing years of the nineteenth century. Never has a 
U||great European Power acquired so rapidly and with so 
U||little apparent effort a position of authority and privilege 
U||in a decadent Oriental state with which its previous 
U||connections and actual community of interests seemed 
U||so slender. Germany stepped, as it were, overnight into 
U||the position left vacant on the Bosphorus when, after the 
U||fail of the Beaconsfield Government, in 1880, England 
U||abruptly changed the course which she had hitherto 
U||steered in the Near East. The new German Empire had 
U||then entered upon a period of commercial and industrial 
U||expansion at home, of which the conquest of new 
U||markets abroad was the necessary corollary, and 
U||German statesmen were quick to recognise the oppor- 
U||tunities which lay before German enterprise in a country 
U||where so much goes by favour, and political influence 
U||can be so effectually exerted for the furtherance of com- 
U||mercial interests. The first appearance of the Germans 
U||on the field was ostensibly in a military capacity, as 
U||became the leading military power on the Continent. 
U||English and French and other foreign officers had been 
U||from time to time employed in Turkey with a view to the 
U||reorganisation of the Turkish army and gendarmerie. 
U||VON DER GOLTZ AND HIS OFFICERS 187 
U||But for various reasons, neither they nor their Turkish 
U||employers had ever taken their work very seriously, 
U||and though some of them, like Valentine Baker and 
U||Hobart, had rendered conspicuous services during 
U||the Russo-Turkish War, their influence was quite in- 
U||adequate to overcome the normal apathy and jealousy 
U||of the Turk. The German officers who accompanied 
U||General von der Goltz, himself an exceptionally dis- 
U||tinguished soldier, at once took up a very different 
U||position, in which they received the full and unvarying 
U||support of their own Government. That they have 
U||served the Turkish Government well the event showed 
U||when the Turkish army took the field against Greece 
U||in 1897. they have none the less been able to do 
U||excellent service to their own country, which has, per- 
U||haps, been an even greater gainer by the bargain than 
U||Turkey. Armaments, ammunition, stores, equipment, 
U||everything that Turkey had to buy abroad, was bought 
U||from Germany. And their influence has not been con- 
U||fined to the War Office. The German military in- 
U||structors have, no doubt, been excellent officers, 
U||but they have been even better commercial agents. 
U||Their credit at the Palace and with the public depart- 
U||ments has been employed, in and out of season, in 
U||pushing German trade and promoting German under- 
U||takings. The powerful influence of William IL has 
U||been exerted with admirable intelligence and persever- 
U||ance to co-ordinate all the forces that could promote the 
U||expansion of German enterprise in Turkey, and the 
U||results from the commercial point of view alone, not to 
U||speak of the political aspect of the question, have been 
U||sufficiently remarkable to deserve attention. The fol- 
U||lowing figures showing the growth of import and export

U||One 
U||of the chief factors in 
U||the development of 
U||German trade with Turkey has been unquestionably the 
U||promotion of railway enterprise in the Ottoman domin- 
U||ions under the auspices of Germany, as the sudden leap 
U||in 1889, shown in the above table, clearly indicates. 
U||The completion in 1885 of the system known as the 
U||‘^Oriental Railways,’’ commenced by the late Baron 
U||Hirsch, placed Germany in direct railway communica- 
U||tion through Hungary, Servia, and Bulgaria, with 
U||Constantinople. On the opposite shores of the Bos- 
U||phorus lay a considerable field of undoubted natural 
U||THE ANATOLIAN RAILWAYS 
U||189 
U||resources, still practically untouched by European 
U||enterprise. The only two railway lines of any import- 
U||ance in Asia Minor were the Smyrna-Ai’din Railway, 
U||for which a concession had been granted as far back as 
U||1856 to an English company, and the Smyrna-Kassaba 
U||Railway, which was then still in the hands of another 
U||English company, that had obtained the concession in 
U||1863. No serious attempt had ever been made to open 
U||up Asia Minor from the Constantinople base, though a 
U||short line of some fifty-six miles had been built by the 
U||Turkish Government in 1871, from Haidar Pasha, just 
U||beyond Scutari on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, 
U||to Ismid at the head of the bay of the same name in the 
U||Sea of Marmora. It had been leased in 1880 for a term 
U||of twenty years to an English company, the Turkish 
U||Government, however, reserving the right of deter- 
U||mining the lease at any moment, subject to compensa- 
U||tion. It was to the acquisition of this short line as the 
U||base of further operations that the Germans first applied 
U||themselves. In 1888 German diplomacy obtained two 
U||Imperial Irades, conveying to the nominee of the 
U||Deutsche Bank, the leading financial institution at 
U||Berlin, the right of working the Haidar Pasha-Ismidt 
U||Railway, and a ninety-nine years concession for an 
U||extension of the line to Angora with a kilometric 
U||guarantee of 10,300 francs for the original line, and of 
U||15,000 francs for the line yet to be constructed. The 
U||capital was raised in Germany for the creation of the 
U||“Ottoman Company of Anatolian Railways,” the 
U||works were pushed on with great energy under a skilled 
U||German staff, the materials being, of course, all pur- 
U||chased in Germany, and within four years the line was 
U||completed. The German position was now so strong 
U||that the real aim of German ambitions could be safely 
U||GERMAN RAILWAY INVASION 
U||190 
U||disclosed. In 1893 another Imperial Irade granted to 
U||the German company two further concessions, one for 
U||the construction of a branch line from Eski Shehir to 
U||Konia, and another for the extension of the Angora 
U||line to Kaisariyeh, with the right to prolong it 
U||eventually through Sivas to Diarbekir and down the 
U||valley of the Tigris to Baghdad. This second con- 
U||cession was before long abandoned. The ostensible 
U||reason was that a careful survey of the country between 
U||Angora and Kaisariyeh had shown the difficulties and 
U||cost of construction to be prohibitive ; the real reason was 
U||that the Germans were alarmed at the jealousy already 
U||displayed in Russia of their intrusion into the northern 
U||part of Asia Minor. The important rights which this 
U||concession carried with it, for the extension to Baghdad, 
U||appear, however, to have been carefully safeguarded. 
U||The Eski Shehir-Konia section was completed in 1896. 
U||The German system had secured a strong foothold in 
U||Asia Minor, and tapped some of its richest provinces. 
U||The next step was to acquire the control, or to circum- 
U||scribe permanently the development of the other railway 
U||interests in Asiatic Turkey. The Ottoman Government 
U||had exercised in 1893 right to buy back the Smyrna- 
U||Kassaba Railway, which had been extended under its 
U||English management to Ala Shehir, and it was trans- 
U||ferred to a French group which undertook to construct 
U||a prolongation to Afium Kara Hissar. At this point it 
U||met the Anatolian Railway which passes through Afium 
U||Kara Hissar on the way from Eski Shehir to Konia, and 
U||if it could only have effected a junction there with the 
U||German line, it would unquestionably have deflected 
U||much of the latter’s traffic from the interior down to 
U||Smyrna instead of Constantinople. The German 
U||Company refused to allow the junction, and though 
U||THE FATE OF THE ENGLISH RAILWAYS 191 
U||such obstruction, however intelligible from the point 
U||of view of its own interests, was clearly detrimental to 
U||the general interests of trade, the Turkish Govern- 
U||ment turned a deaf ear to the remonstrances of the 
U||French Company, and the two lines remained cut off 
U||from each other by a few hundred yards of unmetalled 
U||roadway, until the weaker was driven to give in to the 
U||stronger. The French Company had to accept the 
U||German terms, and though it preserved its nominal 
U||identity, it passed practically under the control of the 
U||Anatolian Company. Thereupon the Porte immediately 
U||reversed its former decision and allowed the junction of 
U||the two lines, which it had previously prohibited, to be 
U||effected at Afium Kara Hissar, The English Smyrna- 
U||Ai'din Company has alone hitherto retained its inde- 
U||pendence, but German influence at Constantinople 
U||has successfully defeated all its efforts to penetrate 
U||further into the interior of Asia Minor, though it has 
U||never asked for any kind of kilometric guarantee from 
U||the Turkish Government, whilst the Anatolian Com- 
U||pany does not build a mile of railway without ample 
U||cover. The Smyrna-Aidin Railway with its intelligent 
U||system of small lateral feeders may possibly succeed 
U||in resisting the pressure of its German neighbours, 
U||but the oldest and most business-like railway enterprise 
U||in Asia Minor, which with a little more support from 
U||the British Government might have been the instru- 
U||ment for opening up the whole country to British trade, 
U||is doomed, if not to absorption by its powerful rival, at 
U||any rate, to permanent exclusion from any wider field 
U||than that upon which it has already conferred an amount 
U||of prosperity rare indeed in Turkey. Mention should 
U||also be made of the small Mersina-Adana line origi- 
U||nally also British, which has been absorbed by the 
U||192 
U||GERMAN RAILWAY INVASION 
U||Anatolian Railway, under an agreement concluded in 
U||1901 with its French proprietors who had taken it 
U||over from their English predecessors. At the same 
U||time, whilst by a bold and consistent policy the field 
U||was being cleared of all competitors in Asia Minor, 
U||the Deutsche Bank and its satellites in South Germany, 
U||Austria, and Switzerland, were busily engaged in 
U||securing a large, if not a preponderating, financial in- 
U||terest in the ‘‘Oriental Railways’’ which control the 
U||European traffic between Germany and Constantinople, 
U||and in cementing close relations with the Turkish Ex- 
U||chequer by doling out to it from time to time some of 
U||those advances of which it stands in chronic need. 
U||Meanwhile quite a voluminous literature had sprung 
U||up in the Fatherland discussing from every point of 
U||view, commercial and economic, strategic and political, 
U||the advantages that were to accrue to Germany from 
U||the conquest by railway of the Sultan’s Asiatic 
U||dominions. The professors foretold the revival of the 
U||ancient glories of Nineveh and Babylon under German 
U||auspices. The Pan-Germans preached the mobilisation 
U||of the “German tribes of Switzerland and of Austria,” 
U||as well as of the actual German Empire, with a view to 
U||the Germanisation of Asia Minor by colonies of German 
U||immigrants, some of them even advocating openly the 
U||establishment of a formal German protectorate, which 
U||should guarantee to the Sultan the preservation of his 
U||Asiatic possessions. Military writers expatiated on the 
U||strategic value of the proposed railway system, for the 
U||protection of which it has been even suggested that 
U||Germany should take a leaf out of Russia’s book in 
U||Manchuria, and establish military posts to secure the 
U||works of construction against the unfriendly interfer- 
U||ence of Kurds and Beduins. The German Emperor, 
U||THE CONVENTION OF 1902 
U||193 
U||with his keen imagination and boundless patriotic 
U||ambitions, had from the beginning taken the liveliest 
U||personal interest in the development of German enter- 
U||prise in Asia Minor, and in Dr. Siemens, the eminent 
U||Director of the Deutsche Bank, he had found an in- 
U||valuable coadjutor who combined with remarkable 
U||business capacity the fervour of an enthusiast. I shall 
U||refer later on to the political activity of German diplo- 
U||macy at Constantinople under the Emperor’s direct 
U||impulse, and to the visit which his Majesty himself 
U||paid to the Sultan in 1898, not disdaining to play for 
U||the nonce, if one may use the term without disrespect, 
U||the part of an Imperial carpet-bagger. In the year 
U||after that memorable visit a Convention was signed 
U||between Dr. Siemens and the Porte, which formally 
U||conceded in principle to the German Anatolian Com- 
U||pany the right to extend from Konia to the Persian 
U||Gulf. A commission of German engineers, with the 
U||German Consul-General Stemrich at its head, proceeded 
U||to survey the ground for the great trunk line, the 
U||German Military Attache at Constantinople was sent to 
U||report upon the strategic aspects of the question, and a 
U||German cruiser visited the Persian Gulf to discover the 
U||most suitable point for a terminus in its waters, whilst 
U||Turkey was at the same time prompted to take imme- 
U||diate steps to revive or establish her sovereignty along 
U||the littoral. On January i6th, 1902, an Imperial Irade 
U||was issued approving the final Convention, of which 
U||the details had been negotiated with the Porte by Dr. 
U||Zander, the Director of the Anatolian Railways after 
U||the death of Dr. Siemens in 1901. It is unnecessary 
U||to enter into the particulars of this Convention, since it 
U||served in its turn only as the basis for the elabora- 
U||tion of the definitive scheme with which we are chiefly 
U||o 
U||194 
U||GERMAN RAILWAY INVASION 
U||concerned. Suffice it to say that the terms were extra- 
U||ordinarily favourable to the German Company, whose 
U||concession for the Anatolian railway system already 
U||constructed was extended for the full term of the new 
U||concession, i.e. for ninety-nine years, whilst there were 
U||indefinite possibilities of further extension in the very 
U||elastic provisions allowing for interruption of the 
U||works in case of certain contingencies. In addition to 
U||branch lines actually specified, the Convention granted 
U||to the German Company a priority of rights with 
U||regard to future extensions which practically secured 
U||to it the control of all railway enterprise in Asiatic 
U||Turkey. The financial conditions, of which the main 
U||feature was a kilometric guarantee to be specially 
U||secured on certain revenues of the State, were equally 
U||favourable to the German Company. They were, at 
U||any rate, as satisfactory as any financial arrangements 
U||based upon Turkish credit can be. 
U||Thus Germany held in her hand the long-coveted 
U||prize. She had acquired the virtual monopoly of rail- 
U||way power in Asiatic Turkey from the Bosphorus to 
U||the Persian Gulf, and what railway power in a decadent 
U||Oriental state means nowadays, when directed by a 
U||strong hand, the Manchurian Railway is there to show, 
U||not to speak of Germany’s own manipulation of railway 
U||power in Shantung. The German Company in whom 
U||that power was vested was, it is true, officially termed the 
U||“Ottoman” Anatolian Company, but the formula was 
U||as empty as that under which the Manchurian Railway 
U||is officially designated as the “Eastern Chinese.” The 
U||process of “peaceful penetration” might not be so 
U||easy , but German, like Russian, statesmanship works 
U||a longue 6cheance, and from the Elbe to the Euphrates 
U||may not be such a far cry in the future as it seems at 
U||FOREIGN CO-OPERATION 
U||195 
U||present. Putting aside as the dreams of exuberant 
U||patriotism the visions of a Germanised Mesopotamia 
U||in which not a few ardent spirits indulged, there was 
U||enough to justify very sanguine anticipations of com- 
U||mercial and economic ascendency. How comes it, there- 
U||fore, that instead of preserving and working for her 
U||own exclusive benefit the valuable concession acquired 
U||under the Convention of 1902, Germany should have 
U||seemed anxious to transform it into an international 
U||undertaking to be shared with her on a footing of more 
U||or less real equality by other powers? The usual 
U||explanation is that her financial resources were not 
U||sufficient to bear the undivided strain of so heavy an 
U||outlay, and that she had no option but to seek the co- 
U||operation of foreign capital. This explanation contains 
U||part, but, I am inclined to think, only part, of the truth. 
U||It was not only her financial, but also her political, 
U||credit which she felt to be still inadequate for such a 
U||venture on her own account. She owed the concession 
U||itself to the extraordinary influence she had acquired 
U||over the present ruler of Turkey through an excep- 
U||tionally fortunate combination of circumstances coupled 
U||with consummate diplomacy. Could she feel assured 
U||of retaining the same influence throughout the period 
U||required for completing the great work of which the 
U||concession after all merely conveyed the promise ? 
U||What were the real foundations of that influence? 
U||What guarantee did it afford of permanency? To 
U||these queries an answer must be sought in a short re- 
U||trospective survey of German policy at Constantinople. 
U||Though as late as at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 
U||Bismarck had not yet thought it worth while to go one 
U||inch out of his way to conciliate Turkey, the old 
U||Chancellor was quick to seize the opportunity which 
U||196 
U||GERMAN RAILWAY INVASION 
U||Turkish resentment of the new policy inaugurated by 
U||Mr. Gladstone’s Cabinet in 1880 offered to German 
U||diplomacy. From that moment, without ever com- 
U||mitting herself too deeply, Germany began to play 
U||the part of “the friend of Turkey” in the European 
U||concert. In the negotiations connected with the rectifi- 
U||cation of the Turkish frontiers for the benefit of Greece 
U||and Montenegro in 1880, and during the complications 
U||which followed the Philippoli Revolution in 1885, 
U||Bismarck, without ever getting off the international 
U||fence, always leant over to the Turkish side, as far as 
U||he could prudently do so without compromising the 
U||equilibrium of Germany’s policy. William II. has 
U||merely trodden the same path, with perhaps less dis- 
U||cretion. The complimentary missions, the congratu- 
U||latory telegrams, the presents, the decorations with 
U||which he continuously courted the favour of the Sultan, 
U||the indifference to the Armenian horrors, of which he 
U||set the tone throughout Germany, the sympathy with 
U||which he ostentatiously followed the victories of Turkish 
U||arms in Greece, were but the preliminaries of a much 
U||more significant demonstration. Abdul Hamid was 
U||still practically boycotted by public opinion throughout 
U||the civilised world when the German Emperor pro- 
U||ceeded, with all the pomp in which he revels, to 
U||Constantinople and Syria in the autumn of 1898. A 
U||potentate who had handed over thousands of his 
U||Christian subjects — men, women, and children — in the 
U||very streets of his capital to the fury of his Mussulman 
U||soldiery could hardly be expected to resist the blandish- 
U||ments of a powerful Christian ruler, who not only 
U||consented to accept his hospitality, but proclaimed 
U||urbi et orbi that “His Majesty the Sultan and the 
U||300,000,000 Mohammedans who, scattered over all 
U||GERMANY’S “FLUTE” 
U||197 
U||parts of the earth, venerate him as their Kaliph can 
U||ever rely upon the friendship of the German Emperor.” 
U||It is true that neither in connection with Egypt, nor 
U||after the Greek war, nor during the crisis in Crete, 
U||nor at the time of the French naval demonstration 
U||at Mitylene, nor during the recent troubles in the 
U||Balkans, has Germany ever made any real stand or 
U||risked any unpleasant consequences for the benefit 
U||of Turkey, The most she ever ventured to do was 
U||to lay down her flute ” when the other powers refused 
U||to dance to the Turkish tune she had piped for them 
U||in vain in the waters of Crete. But herein lies pre- 
U||cisely the Emperor William’s diplomatic genius. He 
U||realised that even Abdul Hamid’s shrewdness is not 
U||proof against personal flattery, and without sacrificing 
U||a single German interest, and, least of all, without im- 
U||perilling the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier, 
U||he has persuaded that astute potentate of the value 
U||and sincerity of a platonic friendship from which 
U||Turkey has not yet on a single occasion derived any 
U||substantial benefit. 
U||At the same time William IL is doubtless much 
U||too intelligent not to realise how precarious are the 
U||foundations upon which Germany’s position at Con- 
U||stantinople 'must in these circumstances rest. At any 
U||moment there may arise in South-Eastern Europe 
U||a situation of such extreme peril for Turkey that 
U||the Sultan will be compelled to put Germany’s friend- 
U||ship to a crucial test. What the result would have 
U||to be if it meant for Germany the slightest de- 
U||parture from her policy of traditional subserviency to 
U||her Eastern neighbour, William IL is perfectly well 
U||aware. He can only cultivate the friendship of the 
U||Sultan so long as it does not seriously impair Germany’s 
U||igS GERMAN RAILWAY INVASION 
U||relations with Russia. Of the vigilance and jealousy 
U||with which Russia watches the development of German 
U||enterprise in Asia Minor a significant indication was 
U||given at the beginning of 1900, when, after the con- 
U||clusion of the preliminary convention for the Baghdad 
U||Railway, Russian diplomacy immediately pressed at 
U||Constantinople for priority of rights in respect of the 
U||construction of railways in the northern part of Asia 
U||Minor, and obtained from the Porte an undertaking, 
U||known as the ‘‘Black Sea basin agreement,” that 
U||Russia shall enjoy such priority of rights throughout 
U||the Asiatic provinces of Turkey that drain into the Black 
U||Sea. In the Near East, as in the Far East, Germany 
U||can make a brave show so long as she does not cross 
U||Russia’s path, but, in view of the continental situation 
U||in Europe, she cannot afford in the long run to weigh 
U||her interests or her ambitions either in Turkey or in 
U||China against the danger of a conflict with Russia. 
U||Tried by the fiery ordeal of a grave international crisis, 
U||Germany’s influence at Constantinople could hardly 
U||emerge unscathed. But a domestic crisis at Yildiz 
U||Kiosk might affect it at least equally prejudicially. So 
U||long as Abdul Hamid lives and retains power his will 
U||is law, and if he is Germany’s friend she can dispense 
U||with any other friends in Turkey. It is well for her that 
U||this is so, for outside the Palace her friends in Turkey 
U||are few indeed. Even in the army, except amongst 
U||those who have studied or served in Germany and owe 
U||their advancement to German influence, the Germans 
U||have inspired more jealousy than love. Amongst the 
U||official classes generally and amongst the people, as far as 
U||the people count in Turkey, they are hated alike for the 
U||good and the bad qualities of the German character, for 
U||their intelligence, their pushfulness, their business-like 
U||THE HAMIDIAN REGIME 
U||199 
U||capacity, their grasping selfishness, and their success. 
U||Not the least of the causes which have made them 
U||detested by many Turks is that the German Emperor 
U||is the Sultan’s friend, for though the Turks tremble 
U||before their master there are few of them who do not 
U||regard him as the worst enemy of his country. When- 
U||ever the Hamidian regime comes to an end the influence 
U||of the one European power which is most closely 
U||associated with it in the minds of every Turk will be 
U||involved in its fall. It is therefore of the utmost 
U||importance to Germany, merely from the point of view 
U||of the internal situation at Constantinople, apart from 
U||all financial or international considerations, to enlist 
U||with a view to future developments, which may not be 
U||very remote, as many foreign interests as possible in 
U||support of the greatest undertaking she has entered 
U||upon in Turkey. She cannot hope to complete the 
U||Baghdad Railway within Abdul Hamid’s lifetime, even 
U||if his life were a better one than it would for various 
U||reasons appear to be, and what will happen when 
U||Abdul Hamid disappears the most intelligent states- 
U||manship cannot foresee. But it can foresee the 
U||expediency of being forearmed against possible con- 
U||tingencies. If, without sacrificing the substantial 
U||control she has acquired over the Baghdad Railway, 
U||she can engineer a combination which would secure 
U||to her in all circumstances the co-operation of Great 
U||Britain, France, and others — but above all of Great 
U||Britain— she will be in a vastly better position to 
U||await events that will necessarily to some extent 
U||jeopardise, and may even suddenly bring down with 
U||a rush, the unsupported fabric of her influence at 
U||Constantinople. 
U||CHAPTER XVIII 
U||THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY CONVENTION OF 1903 
U||I F, as I have shown, it was Germany’s interest to 
U||try and enlist the co-operation of foreign capital 
U||and the political support of other powers — and more 
U||especially of England— for the Baghdad Railway, it 
U||was clearly necessary that the Anatolian Company, of 
U||which the essentially German character was too patent 
U||to all, should retire discreetly into the background and 
U||make room for an at least outwardly more cosmopolitan 
U||arrangement. Whilst the Deutsche Bank was preparing 
U||the ground in London and Paris, fresh negotiations 
U||were being conducted all through 1902 at Constanti- 
U||nople, which resulted in the creation of a new Company 
U||to be styled the “ Imperial Ottoman Baghdad Railway 
U||Company,” and the conclusion of a Convention between 
U||the founders of that company and the Ottoman Govern- 
U||ment, embodying with certain amendments and addi- 
U||tions the provisions contained in the Convention of 
U||January i6th, 1902. The definitive Convention was 
U||signed at Constantinople on March 5th, 1903, by 
U||Zihni Pasha, the Minister of Commerce and Public 
U||Works, on behalf of the Turkish Government, and by 
U||Herr Arthur Gwinner, President of the Deutsche Bank 
U||of Berlin, and Dr. Zander, Director - General, and 
U||M. Huguenin, Assistant Director - General of the 
U||Anatolian Railways on behalf of the new Company. 
U||200 
U||THE ORIGINAL ROUTE 
U||201 
U||On the same date the Cahier des Charges, accompany- 
U||ing the Convention, and the Statutes of the new Com- 
U||pany, received the sanction of the Turkish Government. 
U||The French text of the Convention will be found in 
U||the Appendix. But as it forms the charter of an under- 
U||taking which may be destined to play quite as important 
U||a part in Western Asia as the Eastern Chinese or 
U||Manchurian Railway has played in Eastern Asia, it 
U||deserves to be carefully examined, and to this end 
U||some explanatory comments may not be out of place. 
U||Under Article I. the Ottoman Government grants a 
U||concession to the Anatolian Railway Company for the 
U||construction and working of a prolongation of the 
U||Konia line (Anatolian Railway) to Baghdad and Basra, 
U||passing through, or as near as possible to, the towns 
U||of Keraman, Eregli, Kardash-Beli, Adana, Hamidieh, 
U||Osmanieh, Bagtcheh, Kazanali, Killis, Tell-Habesh, 
U||Harran, Ras-ul-Ain, Nussibin, Avniat, Mosul, Tekrit, 
U||Sadijeh, Baghdad, Kerbela, Nedjef, Zubeir, and Basra ; 
U||as well as of branch lines (i) from Tell-Habesh to 
U||Aleppo, (2) from a point to be hereafter determined to 
U||Urfa, (3) from Sadijeh to Khanikin, and (4) from Zubeir 
U||to a point on the Persian Gulf to be settled by com- 
U||mon accord between the Ottoman Government and the 
U||concessionnaire. 
U||The original plan had been to carry on the trans- 
U||continental line, not from Konia, but from Angora, 
U||the northern extension of the Anatolian Railway 
U||system, through Sivas and Diarbekir to the Tigris. 
U||The Sultan had from the first strongly favoured that 
U||plan, as it presented great strategical advantages from 
U||the Turkish point of view, enabling troops to be 
U||moved up rapidly in case of need all along the line 
U||from Baghdad towards the Russian frontier beyond 
U||202 BAGHDAD RAILWAY CONVENTION OF 1903 
U||Erzeroum, But the Germans, who had doubtless 
U||received some intimation of the views held in St. 
U||Petersburg, which subsequently found diplomatic ex- 
U||pression in the Black Sea Basin’^ agreement of 
U||March, 1900, decided to reject the northern route in 
U||favour of the southern one. From Konia the first 
U||section of the new railway as far as Eregli presents 
U||no serious difficulties. It continues to run so far over 
U||the Anatolian plateau at an altitude of about 3,000 
U||feet. But, after reaching Eregli, it is immediately con- 
U||fronted by the great mountain barrier which separates 
U||the Anatolian plateau from the plains of Mesopotamia. 
U||The difficulties it will have to surmount are picturesquely 
U||described by Mr. Whigham in one of the chapters he 
U||devotes to the Baghdad Railway in his instructive book 
U||on The Persian Problem. Advantage is to be taken 
U||first of the wild canon of the Chakit Su, which cleaves 
U||the Taurus range in twain, and then of the historic 
U||pass known as the Cilician Gates, through which the 
U||path of conquest has been trod in turn by many an 
U||invading army, from the days of Xerxes and Darius 
U||down to those of the great Egyptian, Ibrahim Pasha. 
U||Thence the railway will cross the small and fertile 
U||plain of Adana, before scaling the second but less 
U||formidable rampart which falls away in easier slopes 
U||towards the basin of the Euphrates and the Tigris. 
U||The two sections from Eregli to Adana, and from 
U||Adana to Tell-Habesh, where the branch line will 
U||diverge to Aleppo and Northern Syria, will certainly 
U||prove the most difficult and costly of all, as they will 
U||necessitate altogether nearly a hundred miles of blast- 
U||ing and tunnelling. After emerging from the Taurus 
U||mountains the line, instead of sweeping round the foot- 
U||hills through the fairly populous and fertile districts of 
U||DESERTS AND SWAMPS 
U||203 
U||Urfa and Diarbekir into the upper valley of the Tigris 
U||and down to Mosul, is to be carried in a straight line 
U||across the desert between the twin rivers of Meso- 
U||potamia to Mosul, and thence down the desolate right 
U||bank of the Tigris to Baghdad. It is true that a feeder 
U||is to be thrown out to Urfa, and others are contem- 
U||plated later on to Marash, Aintab, Birejik, Mardin, 
U||Erbil, and to Tuzkurmatli and Salahieh in the Kerkuk 
U||district. But the proposed route for the main line 
U||would hardly have been adopted by the Company had 
U||not the kilometric guarantee rendered it financially 
U||independent of the immediate resources of the country 
U||to be traversed between the Taurus and Baghdad. 
U||From Baghdad a very important branch is to go off 
U||to the Persian frontier at Khanikin, whence one of the 
U||chief trade routes into Persia lies through Kermanshah 
U||and Hamadan to Teheran. The annual value of the 
U||British trade carried on with Persia by this route 
U||is estimated at ;£’75o,ooo — a fact which serves inci- 
U||dentally to illustrate the many-sided bearings of the 
U||Baghdad Railway upon British interests. From Bagh- 
U||dad the main line is to trend back to the Euphrates and 
U||cross it again in order to touch at the two sacred cities 
U||of the Shiah Mussulmans, Kerbela and Nedjef, where 
U||the mere pilgrim traffic from Persia and from India 
U||must prove a considerable source of revenue, on the 
U||way down to Basrah, the chief port of the Shatt-el- 
U||Arab, and to its appointed terminus, wherever it may 
U||ultimately be, on the Persian Gulf. The barest pre- 
U||liminary surveys have, however, yet been made of the 
U||Mesopotamian sections of the railway, which will 
U||certainly present some rather serious difficulties, owing 
U||to the intricate network of swamps and marshes that 
U||cover so large a portion of the great fluvial delta. 
U||204 BAGHDAD RAILWAY CONVENTION OF 1903 
U||The total length of the new railway, including the 
U||branches, for the construction of which immediate 
U||provision is made, is not set down anywhere in the 
U||Convention, even approximately, though in view of the 
U||kilometric guarantee to which the Turkish Government 
U||is pledged, it would seem to be a very material point. 
U||It may be estimated roughly at 1,750 miles, and if we 
U||add for the existing Anatolian railways 625 miles, and 
U||for the Smyrna-Kassaba and Mersina-Adana railways, 
U||which have already passed under German control, 
U||another 400 miles, the entire system will amount to an 
U||aggregate of nearly 2,800 miles, independently of the 
U||further extensions already contemplated, and of the 
U||ultimate absorption of Syrian and Arabian railways. 
U||The concession is granted (Article II.) for ninety-nine 
U||years, but in reality it will extend over a slightly longer 
U||period. For the ninety-nine years’ term will run for 
U||each of the sections into which the line is to be divided 
U||from the date when the State bonds to be issued by the 
U||Ottoman Government are handed over in respect of 
U||it. The Anatolian railways’ concession, which was 
U||originally for a similar term of ninety-nine years, 
U||whereof fifteen have already expired, is at the same 
U||time extended so as to cover the full period of the new 
U||Company’s concession. 
U||The new line is to be divided up for purposes of 
U||construction into sections, each of approximately 200 
U||kilometres (Article III.). These sections are not 
U||specified, but it is understood that starting from Konia 
U||the main line to the Persian Gulf will comprise twelve 
U||sections, viz. Konia-Eregli, Eregli-Adana, Adana-Tell 
U||Habesh (whence the branch line to Aleppo), Tell- 
U||Habesh-Harran (whence the branch line to Urfa), 
U||Harran-Nussibin, Nussibin- Mosul, Mosul - Tekrit, 
U||A CURIOUS STIPULATION 
U||205 
U||Tekrit-Baghdad (with a branch line from Sadijeh to 
U||Khanikin on the Persian frontier), Baghdad-Nedjef, 
U||Nedjef-Zubeir and Basra (two sections), and finally 
U||Zubeir to the Persian Gulf. 
U||Article IV. binds the concessionnaire to begin work 
U||on the first section within three months from approval 
U||of the plans, and to complete it within two years. At 
U||the same time it is provided that the whole line and its 
U||branches shall be completed within eight years, a 
U||curiously short allowance for the completion of the 
U||other sections when compared with the two years 
U||allowed for completion of the first section alone. But 
U||this article contains another still more curious pro- 
U||vision. The term fixed for the completion of the whole 
U||line is subject not only to the punctual fulfilment by the 
U||Ottoman Government of its financial obligations to- 
U||wards the concessionnaire, which is a very natural 
U||stipulation, but also to delays arising from force 
U||majeure; and force majeure includes, as well as war 
U||between European powers, any radical change in the 
U||financial situation of Germany, England, or France. 
U||As there is nothing to indicate what shall be deemed to 
U||constitute such a radical change, nor who shall deter- 
U||mine when such a radical change shall be held to have 
U||taken place, this provision appears liable to very elastic 
U||construction. 
U||The railway is to be built (Article VII.) in the first 
U||instance for a single line, but a second line is to be 
U||laid when the gross kilometric receipts shall have 
U||reached 30,000 francs per annum. 
U||Article VIII. provides for the creation of an Ottoman 
U||Joint Stock Company under the name of ‘^Imperial 
U||Ottoman Baghdad Railway Company,” which shall 
U||take the place of the Anatolian Railway Company in 
U||2o6 BAGHDAD RAILWAY CONVENTION OF 1903 
U||all that concerns the new line from Konia to the 
U||Persian Gulf with its branches. The Anatolian Rail- 
U||way Company engages not to transfer its lines to any 
U||other than the Imperial Ottoman Baghdad Railway 
U||Company, and the latter binds itself not to part with 
U||its property in any shape or form. 
U||Article IX. allows the Company during construction 
U||to acquire and use steam and sailing vessels and other 
U||craft on the Shatt-el-Arab, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, 
U||for the transport of materials and other requirements. 
U||Considering how jealous the Turkish Government is of 
U||all navigation rights on those waterways, this clause, 
U||even with the restrictions attached to the permission, 
U||is of considerable significance, for when the Company 
U||has once acquired the plant necessary for navigating 
U||those waters and established the wharves and ware- 
U||houses it is entitled to construct at Baghdad and Basra 
U||under another article of the concession, it is, at least, 
U||improbable that it will consent to relinquish the advan- 
U||tages of navigation. 
U||Article XIL opens up the way for an almost indefinite 
U||extension of the new Company’s control over the rail- 
U||ways, not merely of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, but 
U||of Syria and Northern Arabia. Whilst professing to 
U||safeguard the rights of the Damascus-Hamah Railway 
U||Company, a French company at present, it secures 
U||to the Baghdad Railway Company prior rights for the 
U||construction of any branch connecting it with the 
U||Mediterranean between Mersina and Tripoli in Syria. 
U||The Baghdad Railway Company is thus brought into 
U||contact with the Syrian railway system, which is made 
U||up at present of several small lines that would there- 
U||fore seem bound to pass ultimately under the control 
U||of their powerful neighbour, and eventually with the 
U||BY TRAIN TO MECCA 
U||207 
U||line which the Sultan is engaged in building from 
U||Damascus via Mezarib to Mecca. Already in 1901 
U||the Anatolian Company was approached by Abdul 
U||Hamid with the request that it should take up a 
U||contract for completing the Hedjaz Railway, of which 
U||the small section that had then been built was proving 
U||a severe drain upon his Majesty’s purse. One of the 
U||considerations for which the Sultan granted the 
U||Baghdad Railway concession is believed to have been 
U||a promise of assistance in carrying out this pet project 
U||which would ultimately link up by rail the seats of his 
U||temporal and spiritual sovereignty. 
U||Article XXI I L gives the Company the right to 
U||establish ports on the Tigris at Baghdad, on the Shatt- 
U||el-Arab at Basra, and at the terminal point on the 
U||Persian Gulf. With the powers conferred upon it, the 
U||Company as the owner of the wharves, quays, ware- 
U||houses, etc., which it is authorised to construct, must 
U||inevitably acquire complete control of the traffic by 
U||water as well as by land. Mention may also be made 
U||in this connection of Article XXIX., which forbids the 
U||working of any section of the line between Baghdad 
U||and Basra that may have been built before completion 
U||of the main line from Konia to Baghdad. The new 
U||Company clearly has no wish to see that district opened 
U||up from the Persian Gulf before it has obtained access 
U||to it from the North. 
U||The financial obligations of the Ottoman Govern- 
U||ment are set forth in Article XXXV. It guarantees 
U||a two-fold kilometric annuity, one of 11,000 francs per 
U||kilometre, built and opened to traffic, and one of 4,500 
U||francs per kilometre towards working expenses, and 
U||provides for the mode of payment of these annuities. 
U||An Ottoman State loan at 4 per cent., with a sinking 
U||2o8 BAGHDAD RAILWAY CONVENTION OF 1903 
U||fund of *087538 per cent., to be guaranteed by special 
U||appropriations which shall be settled before the con- 
U||struction of each successive section is commenced, is 
U||to represent the kilometric annuity of 11,000 francs, 
U||the Company receiving bonds of a face value of 
U||269, iio’ 65 francs per kilometre, built and opened to 
U||traffic. For the first section beyond Konia, bonds to 
U||the nominal value of 54,000,000 francs are to be issued 
U||in the first instance. The annuity of 4,500 francs per 
U||kilometre towards working expenses, which is to be 
U||gradually reduced as the gross kilometric receipts reach 
U||given amounts, is guaranteed on the surplus of the 
U||guarantees already appropriated to the Anatolian 
U||Railway. The Baghdad Railway Company, moreover, 
U||pledges to the holders of the state bonds the whole 
U||line from Konia to the Persian Gulf and its branches, 
U||and all its rolling stock, etc., and its share of the 
U||net receipts. The bondholders, however, will have no 
U||right to interfere in the administration of the Company. 
U||The liabilities of the Ottoman Government under this 
U||clause are heavy. It is true that in respect of the 
U||Anatolian Railway a kilometric guarantee only very 
U||slightly inferior in amount was given by the Porte, 
U||that the revenue of both the Konia and Angora lines 
U||has shown remarkable expansion, and that as a set 
U||off to the proportionately diminishing burden on the 
U||Treasury, Turkey has materially benefited by the in- 
U||creased prosperity of the provinces thus opened up to 
U||tmde and agriculture. But the Anatolian Railway, 
U||like the two railways from Smyrna, has tapped the 
U||richest parts of Asia Minor, and if the first two sections 
U||of the Baghdad Railway beyond Konia may also be 
U||expected to earn a fair revenue, the same can certainly 
U||not be predicated of the further sections, and especially 
U||TURKEY’S FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS 209 
U||not of those which cross the arid wastes of the upper 
U||Euphrates and Tigris basin. There, even according 
U||to German estimates, many years and even decades 
U||must elapse before there can be any results to show 
U||for the heavy annual payments which the Turkish 
U||Exchequer will have to meet. Even in what were of 
U||old the most fertile tracts of Mesopotamia, extensive 
U||and costly works of both irrigation and drainage will 
U||be required in addition to the railway, if anything like 
U||its ancient prosperity is to be restored. Many different 
U||calculations have been made as to the amount which 
U||the kilometric guarantee on the whole Baghdad line 
U||is likely to reach, and a very moderate estimate places 
U||it at over ;£‘i,ooo,ooo per annum after allowing for 
U||probable revenue. How is the Turkish Exchequer, in 
U||its condition of chronic penury, to provide such a large 
U||sum? The Convention itself leaves this question un- 
U||answered. But just after the conclusion of the 1902 
U||Convention the Anatolian Company is stated to have 
U||intimated to the Porte that it would accept as security 
U||for the kilometric guarantee appropriations from an 
U||increase of the Turkish Customs dues, from the creation 
U||of certain monopolies, or from the unification of the 
U||Ottoman debt. 
U||Nor does Article XXXV. represent the whole of 
U||Turkey’s financial obligations. Under Article XXXVII. 
U||the Turkish Government is to provide two further an- 
U||nuities of 350,000 francs each, one for a period of thirty 
U||years to cover the cost of betterment works to the 
U||extent of 8,000,000 francs on the Anatolian Company’s 
U||lines, and another, to commence as soon as the new 
U||line reaches Aleppo, for the purpose of covering the 
U||cost of express train services. 
U||Under various other articles a number of minor but 
U||210 
U||BAGHDAD RAILWAY CONVENTION OF 1903 
U||valuable rights are conferred upon the Company ; ex- 
U||emption from Customs dues for all materials, machinery, 
U||rolling-stock, iron, wood, coal imported from abroad 
U||during the period of construction and extension, and 
U||exemption from all taxation of the Company’s entire 
U||property and revenue during the whole term of the 
U||concession ; mining and quarrying and forest rights 
U||within a zone of twenty kilometres on either side of 
U||the line; the right to establish warehouses, elevators, 
U||etc. ; to manufacture bricks and tiles, and to make free 
U||use of any natural water power in the vicinity of the 
U||line for traction and lighting purposes ; all of which 
U||tend to smooth the way for a monopoly of the economic 
U||exploitation of the country. 
U||The usual provision is made to enable the Ottoman 
U||Government to resume possession of the railway at any 
U||moment, but on conditions so onerous as to render the 
U||provision practically illusory. The annuity to be paid 
U||to the Company in such event until the expiry of the 
U||concession is to be calculated on the basis of 50 per 
U||cent, of the average gross revenue during the last five 
U||years preceding resumption of possession, and is, in 
U||no circumstances, to amount to less than 12,000 francs 
U||per kilometre. Nor can the Ottoman Government 
U||resume possession in order to lease the railway to any 
U||other company. 
U||On the other hand, the Company undertakes to make 
U||provision for postal and telegraphic services under the 
U||control of the Ottoman Government for the transport 
U||of troops in time of war and of peace, and for the 
U||establishment, at its own expense, of the military posts 
U||required by the Ministry of War up to a total expendi- 
U||ture of 4,000,000 francs, the Government, moreover, 
U||remaining at liberty to fortify all such points as it may 
U||THE CLAIMS OF CHARITY 
U||2II 
U||deem necessary. The Company also undertakes that 
U||within five years from the opening of each section the 
U||personnel employed upon it, with the exception of the 
U||superior officials, shall be composed exclusively of 
U||Ottoman subjects. All the officials are to wear the fez 
U||and a uniform to be chosen by the Ottoman Govern- 
U||ment. And finally, during the duration of the con- 
U||cession, the Company is to contribute annually ;£’T.500 
U||to the Asile des Pawores! The caution money to be 
U||deposited on this gigantic concession was fixed at the 
U||modest sum of ;£’T. 30,000. 
U||The Cahier des Charges accompanying the conces- 
U||sion contains detailed provisions with regard to the 
U||construction of the line, of which the gauge is to be 
U||I m. 435 ~i m. 455 inside the rails, and with regard to 
U||rates for passengers and freight. It also provides for a 
U||daily service of ordinary trains in both directions, and 
U||for an express service, weekly, between Haidar Pasha 
U||and Aleppo, and fortnightly to the Persian Gulf, with an 
U||average speed of 45 kilometres an hour for the first five 
U||years after the line is opened to traffic, and afterwards 
U||of 60 kilometres an hour. This would work out to 
U||about 72 hours in the first instance for the journey 
U||from Constantinople to the Persian Gulf, and 54 hours 
U||only if the counsels of perfection contemplated in the 
U||second instance are ever fulfilled. 
U||Another clause of the Cahier des Charges is of peculiar 
U||significance. The specifications for metallic bridges 
U||are to be drawn up in accordance with the last 
U||circular of either the Prussian or the French Ministry 
U||of Public Works, and the rails, sleepers, etc., are to be 
U||of the type adopted by the Prussian State railways. 
U||The Statutes regulate the constitution of the ‘im- 
U||perial Ottoman Baghdad Railway Company” to be 
U||212 BAGHDAD RAILWAY CONVENTION OF 1903 
U||created under Article VIII. of the Convention. Though 
U||primarily formed to carry out the concession conveyed 
U||by that Convention, the new Company explicitly re- 
U||serves power to acquire interests in any other railways 
U||already built or to be built in the whole of the Ottoman 
U||Empire. It is to have its seat in Constantinople. 
U||Whilst the Anatolian Railway Company undertakes 
U||to transfer to the new Company under Article 5 the 
U||concession granted to it under the above Convention, 
U||it nevertheless preserves for its own exclusive benefit 
U||all rights and obligations concerning the old railway 
U||lines, as well as those which it derives from Articles II., 
U||XXXIII., and XXXVII. of the above Convention. 
U||Under Article 6 the initial share capital of the 
U||Company is fixed at 15,000,000 francs. The Anatolian 
U||Railway Company shall subscribe 10 per cent, of the 
U||share capital, and shall not alienate its holding without 
U||the consent of the Ottoman Government. The Otto- 
U||man Government shall also have the right to subscribe 
U||up to 10 per cent, of the share capital. 
U||Article 12 states that the Company will be ad- 
U||ministered by a council of administration consisting 
U||of eleven members, three of whom shall be nominated 
U||by the Anatolian Railway Company. The others will 
U||be appointed by the general assembly. Three members 
U||shall be Ottoman subjects. 
U||The most important article, however, is Article 20, 
U||under which the council is invested with the widest 
U||powers for administering the property and affairs of the 
U||Company, et ^eut meme transiger et compromettre." 
U||For it is in virtue of these powers that the Germans, 
U||being so far in sole control, were able to negotiate 
U||abroad and to make the proposals for British co- 
U||operation which his Majesty’s Government ultimately 
U||LATER MODIFICATIONS 
U||213 
U||had under their consideration. These proposals cer- 
U||tainly involved considerable modifications of the ar- 
U||rangements set forth in the document signed at 
U||Constantinople, and the British Government was, no 
U||doubt, justified in declaring that the latter had not 
U||come within their purview. Nevertheless, the bearing 
U||of the whole question can hardly be correctly appre- 
U||ciated unless those proposals are studied in the light 
U||of the original arrangements they were intended to 
U||modify. 
U||CHAPTER XIX 
U||THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY AND BRITISH 
U||INTERESTS 
U||A S one of the main arguments put forward in sup- 
U||L port of British co-operation was the international 
U||character which had already been imparted to the 
U||undertaking by the promise of French co-operation, it 
U||may be well to examine in the first place the nature 
U||and extent of such French co-operation. In France 
U||powerful stock exchange influences were induced at 
U||an early date to favour participation in the German 
U||scheme. It was closely connected with a project for 
U||the unification of the Ottoman Debt promoted mainly 
U||by the French bondholders, who now hold the bulk of 
U||Turkish Government securities, and as the unification 
U||promises to create a surplus revenue which might 
U||be appropriated to the kilometric guarantee on the 
U||Baghdad Railway, Germany had undertaken to lend 
U||diplomatic support to that project in Constantinople. 
U||Moreover, since the two French railway companies in 
U||Asia Minor, the Smyrna- Kassaba and the Adana- 
U||Mersina, had been compelled to throw in their lot 
U||with the Anatolian Company, a certain community of 
U||material interests had been established in that respect 
U||between the French and the Germans. Before the signa- 
U||ture of the preliminary Convention, December 23rd, 
U||1899, with the P orte, the Germans had definitely agreed 
U||214 
U||FRENCH PARTICIPATION 
U||2^5 
U||to reserve participation for French capital, and it was 
U||finally arranged in February last before the signature of 
U||the new Convention that its participation should be 
U||equal to that of German capital. The French Govern- 
U||ment, on the other hand, always anxious to avoid giving 
U||offence to Russia, who had repeatedly given more or 
U||less open expression to her hostility to the Baghdad 
U||Railway scheme, had been careful not to depart from a 
U||prudent attitude of official neutrality. Nothing indeed 
U||could be more categorical than the statement made by 
U||the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Chamber on 
U||March 24th, 1892, that French diplomacy had never 
U||interfered officially or semi-officially in the matter. The 
U||action of the French Ambassador at Constantinople, and 
U||M. Delcasse’s own language, betrayed, however, a dis- 
U||position to give as benevolent a character as possible 
U||to the neutrality of France. That was all the Germans 
U||could expect, and all they required, from the French 
U||Government, at whose hands they had no special 
U||favours to ask. They wanted only the co-operation of 
U||French capital, and so long as no official pressure was 
U||brought to bear against it, they had every reason to 
U||anticipate success. 
U||In England the situation was quite different, and 
U||much less promising. Yet except, perhaps, from the 
U||purely financial point of view British co-operation was 
U||far more important to Germany than French co-oper- 
U||ation. It was not, in fact, financial co-operation so 
U||much as political co-operation the Germans had to seek 
U||for in England. Some years ago, when the German 
U||scheme was still in its embryonic stage and Anglo- 
U||German relations were more friendly than they have 
U||been recently, British statesmen had been informally 
U||approached from Berlin and had, very properly, ex- 
U||2i6 ENGLAND AND THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 
U||pressed their appreciation of Germany’s apparent desire 
U||to secure British sympathy and support on terms of 
U||mutual benefit to both countries. In the meantime, 
U||however, the attitude of Germany during the South 
U||African war, the virulence of the German Press, and 
U||the more guarded, but scarcely less hostile, utterances 
U||of German statesmen, had given deep offence in this 
U||country. This was, however, no reason for either 
U||British ministers or British capitalists to refuse to 
U||consider any proposals, merely because they happened 
U||to be made in Germany,” which could be shown to be 
U||really beneficial to British interests. But it was a 
U||reason for the utmost caution and circumspection. To 
U||satisfy British public opinion a very strong case had to 
U||be made out. 
U||The Germans very adroitly professed themselves 
U||anxious to place the negotiations on a purely business 
U||basis. It was primarily a matter of finance to be dealt 
U||with on its merits by financiers with financiers. The 
U||Deutsche Bank of Berlin, whilst the final convention 
U||was under negotiation at Constantinople, approached 
U||certain influential houses established in London with a 
U||view to the formation of a British group of capitalists 
U||who should co-operate with the German and other 
U||groups. This was, however, a polite fiction which it 
U||ultimately proved impossible to keep up. The London 
U||houses were not prepared to undertake so large a 
U||financial operation, of which the political bearings 
U||were obvious, unless they were assured of the approval 
U||and support of the British Government. The British 
U||Government naturally were unable to promise their 
U||approval and support unless adequate provision was 
U||made for safeguarding what they conceived to be the 
U||chief British interests concerned in the matter. The 
U||THE QUESTION OF CONTROL 
U||217 
U||Germans again were not prepared to make such pro- 
U||vision unless the British Government pledged them- 
U||selves to certain conditions which would have directly 
U||committed the State to considerable responsibilities. 
U||Thus, by the very force of inherent circumstances, the 
U||negotiations from being nominally financial became 
U||essentially political, and had to be directed willy-nilly 
U||by the Government, though they continued to be con- 
U||ducted through financial intermediaries instead of 
U||through the customary diplomatic channels. 
U||The main point ostensibly at issue in these negotia- 
U||tions was the share which British capital was to acquire 
U||in the control of the railway. The Constantinople 
U||Convention and the statutes of the new Company gave 
U||the Germans an absolutely overwhelming control. The 
U||Anatolian Company was to preserve its independent 
U||entity, and be represented by three directors out of a 
U||total of eleven on the new Company’s Board, whilst 
U||three other directors were to be Ottoman subjects, who 
U||would presumably be little more than clay under the 
U||German potter’s hand. Thus there only remained five 
U||seats to be divided between the Deutsche Reichsbank 
U||and the British, French and other groups that might 
U||co-operate with it. This was, of course, an impossible 
U||arrangement, and the Germans readily admitted it in 
U||London, as they had already admitted it in Paris. 
U||They declared themselves willing to enlarge the 
U||board, and to provide for the equitable representation 
U||of the British element upon it. The precise nature of 
U||the proposals for giving effect to that purpose has not 
U||been officially disclosed, though it has been stated on 
U||good authority that the German, French, and British 
U||groups were each to provide 30 per cent, of the 
U||capital, the balance of 10 per cent, being made up from 
U||2i8 ENGLAND AND THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 
U||other quarters. Whether, even if the British element 
U||had been nominally placed on a footing of complete 
U||equality with the specifically German element, equality 
U||of control would have been really secured, seems very 
U||doubtful, as in addition to the specifically German 
U||element, other elements under German control, such as 
U||Austrian and Swiss, would have remained available to 
U||turn the scales in favour of Germany unless the French 
U||had been constantly ready to act solid with the British 
U||— an unlikely contingency in view of the, at least 
U||partial, community of financial interests between the 
U||French and the Germans. Still the concessions which 
U||the Germans were ready to make in this and also in other 
U||directions were considerable. British industry was to 
U||be assured of a proportionate share in the construction 
U||and equipment of the railway. Exception was naturally 
U||taken in London to the retention by the Anatolian Rail- 
U||way Company of its exclusive rights over the existing 
U||lines from Constantinople, by which alone the Germans 
U||would have been able permanently to control access to 
U||the new railway, and thus to exercise a paramount in- 
U||fluence over the entire system. Here, again, the 
U||Germans, without definitely binding themselves, held 
U||out the prospect of an eventual fusion of the two 
U||Companies, the Anatolian Company surrendering to 
U||the new Company all the rights which it at present 
U||still reserved to itself. But if all these German pro- 
U||posals and assurances were not, as far as they went, 
U||unsatisfactory, they were always coupled with con- 
U||ditions of which the significance was unmistakable. 
U||These conditions, as set forth by Mr. Balfour in the 
U||House of Commons, were threefold. Assurances were 
U||to be obtained from the British Government, firstly, that 
U||they would not object to a reasonable increase of the 
U||THE TURKISH IMPORT TARIFF 
U||2ig 
U||Turkish Customs duties, of which a part should be 
U||used in guaranteeing the Baghdad Railway ; secondly, 
U||that if the Baghdad Railway should prove to be a 
U||substantially better route for conveying the mails to 
U||India, it should be used for their conveyance on terms 
U||to be agreed upon hereafter ; and, thirdly, that Great 
U||Britain should lend her good offices in providing a 
U||proper terminus on the Persian Gulf at or near Koweyt. 
U||To two, at least, of these conditions there were strong 
U||prima facie objections from the British point of view 
U||apart from the general merits of the scheme. With 
U||regard to the Turkish import dues, we had been the 
U||first to recognise that it might be to our advantage as well 
U||as to that of Turkey that we should agree to an increase, 
U||if we could obtain in return some mitigation of the evils 
U||from which trade suffers all over Turkey under adminis- 
U||trative corruption and misgovernment. The British 
U||Government actually agreed some years ago to a specific 
U||tariff on a higher scale than the present ad valorem tariff, 
U||on condition that the Turkish internal and export dues 
U||should be abolished, that bonded warehouses should be 
U||established, and other custom-house facilities granted 
U||for the benefit of foreign trade generally. But all 
U||these conditions have remained unfulfilled, and there 
U||would be less chance than ever of securing their ulti- 
U||mate fulfilment if we were to surrender for another 
U||purpose, such as the creation of revenue to meet the 
U||charges of the Baghdad Railway, the one lever we 
U||shall sooner or later have an opportunity of using for 
U||the protection of our commercial interests. Moreover, 
U||until a new financial scheme was agreed to for the 
U||reorganisation of the Turkish debt, any increase of the 
U||import dues was already pledged to the bondholders 
U||under the Decree of Muharrem. 
U||220 ENGLAND AND THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 
U||With regard to a British postal subsidy for the 
U||transmission of mails to India by the Baghdad Rail- 
U||way, the assurance asked for was either supererogatory 
U||or designed to commit the British Government to an 
U||altogether premature obligation. When the Baghdad 
U||or any other line of railway opening up a new route for 
U||our Indian mails is completed the British Post Office 
U||will naturally use it if it presents sufficient advantages 
U||over the present route, and pay a proper price for the 
U||use of it. But as far as can be judged by any estimates 
U||yet put forward, it is extremely doubtful whether the 
U||Baghdad Railway, assuming it to be made, will present 
U||any sufficient advantages. According to the most 
U||favourable estimate, it might enable the British mails 
U||to be landed at Karachi three days and sixteen hours 
U||ahead of present schedule time at Bombay. Except 
U||for the north-west provinces, twenty-four hours must 
U||be deducted from that estimate for the extra land 
U||journey to destination in India from Karachi as com- 
U||pared with Bombay. Another twenty-four hours at 
U||least may be deducted for the difference between the 
U||present schedule time and real time, as the mails are 
U||constantly landed at Bombay a full day ahead of 
U||schedule time. The maximum gain that can be shown 
U||in favour of the Baghdad route would therefore amount 
U||only to one day sixteen hours, a gain which might very 
U||easily be reduced to the vanishing point by a reason- 
U||able acceleration of the steamship service between 
U||Europe and Bombay. But, at best, the question of 
U||time is not the only one to be considered. Who will 
U||guarantee the same regularity and safety with which 
U||our Indian mails are delivered to-day, when they are 
U||carried by rail across inhospitable regions inhabited by 
U||semi-civilised and often turbulent races, and perpetually 
U||THE INDIAN MAILS 
U||221 
U||liable to those chronic outbreaks of disorder which are 
U||the inevitable outcome of Turkish misrule? Nor is 
U||this all. We can hardly afford to subsidise two mail 
U||routes to India, and, if we give a subsidy to the Bagh- 
U||dad Railway, we shall have to diminish or to withdraw 
U||altogether the subsidies at present granted to British 
U||shipping companies. Now we are essentially a sea- 
U||power, and before we undertake to transfer so important 
U||a mail service as that between the Mother Country and 
U||India from the ocean highways which we can hope to 
U||control in time of war as well as of peace to a land 
U||route across two continents, neither of which we can 
U||control, the advantages in favour of the latter should 
U||not merely be estimated on paper, but tested by ex- 
U||perience and placed beyond all shadow of doubt. 
U||To the third condition put by the Germans — namely, 
U||facilities for establishing the Persian Gulf terminus of 
U||the line at Koweyt, no objection could be taken on its 
U||own merits. Indeed, if a great trunk line is to be 
U||buiU from the Bosphorus to the Persian Gulf, it is in 
U||many respects desirable that its terminus should be 
U||located within the territory of a chief who has placed 
U||himself under our protection. On the other hand, the 
U||Baghdad Railway probably needs Koweyt far more 
U||than we need the Baghdad Railway. In that part of 
U||the Persian Gulf there is no point better fitted by nature 
U||to become the terminus of a great railway system. 
U||There may be other points available, for instance, 
U||Umm Khasa, at the head of the Khor Abdallah, which 
U||lies, it is alleged, outside the actual territory of the 
U||Sheikh of Koweyt. But Umm Khasa is certainly not 
U||more suitable than Koweyt itself, and Koweyt might, 
U||in certain circumstances, prove inconveniently close to 
U||it. Therefore it would unquestionably be a great boon 
U||222 ENGLAND AND THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 
U||for the Baghdad Railway to have the assurance of 
U||friendly access to Koweyt. Whether it was expedient 
U||for the British Government to pledge themselves to 
U||the granting of such a boon depends entirely upon the 
U||view taken of the scheme as a whole from the point of 
U||view of British Imperial interests, political as well as 
U||commercial. 
U||The chief arguments advanced by the two members 
U||of the British Cabinet who appeared to favour the 
U||scheme were, firstly, that this was a great undertaking, 
U||destined to confer upon a vast and interesting region 
U||the blessings of civilisation, and that England owed it 
U||to herself not to stand aloof, and, secondly, that it would 
U||open up a new route from Europe to India, and that 
U||this country, instead of repeating the blunder it com- 
U||mitted forty years ago when it left the Suez Canal to be 
U||built exclusively by foreign enterprise, should lend a 
U||helpful hand from the beginning, so as to make sure of 
U||a share in its ultimate control. The railway, it was 
U||asserted, would be built sooner or later, with or without 
U||us, and if without us, we could not depend upon a 
U||recurrence of the same good fortune which had enabled 
U||us to repair our original mistake in connection with the 
U||Suez Canal by acquiring the Khedive’s interest in it. 
U||The first argument is merely an appeal to sentiment, 
U||and however commendable the sentiment, it may be 
U||pointed out that there are many other undertakings 
U||equally conducive to the spread of civilisation which 
U||this country might promote — some of them perhaps 
U||more pertinent to our national interest — and that with 
U||the best will in the world our resources are not in- 
U||exhaustible. The second argument is more practical 
U||and more plausible, but it is by no means convincing. 
U||To begin with, there is this fundamental difference 
U||between the two schemes, that the Suez Canal opened 
U||THE RETICENCE OF INDIA 
U||223 
U||up through communication by the shortest sea-route 
U||between the United Kingdom and India, whereas the 
U||Baghdad Railway proposes to open up a land route. 
U||Our interests in any highway of the seas must always 
U||be incomparably greater than our interest in any trans- 
U||continental highway. The former are of vital concern 
U||to us ; the latter directly affect only our convenience, 
U||though indirectly and as an instrument that may be 
U||used against us, a transcontinental highway towards 
U||India must always be a potential danger. It might 
U||indeed be argued with some force that in facilitating 
U||the construction of a railway, which we could never 
U||materially control, from the shores of the Bosphorus, 
U||which may at any day pass out of the hands of the 
U||Turk into the keeping of some great European power, 
U||to a terminus which may only be temporarily located in 
U||so remote a corner of the Persian Gulf as Koweyt, we 
U||should be committing the precise counterpart of our 
U||former blunder, when we sought to prevent the removal 
U||of such an obstruction to our communications with 
U||India by sea as the unpierced isthmus of Suez formerly 
U||constituted. It is certainly singular that in the course 
U||of the several parliamentary debates on a question 
U||which concerns India very closely no representative of 
U||the India Office ever spoke, nor was any statement 
U||made of the views of the Indian Government. It 
U||would be interesting to know why. 
U||But it is unnecessary to press those arguments. We 
U||need not regard the Baghdad Railway as any menace 
U||to India, nor look with jealousy upon its construction, 
U||and yet it may be undesirable for us to lend it a help- 
U||ing hand in the shape it has assumed under German 
U||auspices, or, at any rate, to do so except on much more 
U||favourable terms than have yet been offered to us. 
U||Without giving way to national prejudices, which

U||would rule out Germany from among the powers 
U||with whom this country should in any circumstances 
U||co-operate, one may be allowed to ask whether our ex- 
U||perience of co-operation with Germany in China, either 
U||politically, under the Anglo-German agreement of 1900, 
U||or economically, under different railway agreements 
U||between English and German groups of capitalists, has 
U||proved so satisfactory that we should wish to repeat it 
U||in Asiatic Turkey. Or, if we confine our purview to 
U||Turkey, has German influence been exercised at Con- 
U||stantinople with so much consideration for British 
U||interests, either political or economic, that we should 
U||tie ourselves up with it indefinitely ? What assurance 
U||have we, in the present condition of the Turkish 
U||Empire, that Asia Minor and Mesopotamia may not 
U||become the sgene of the same sort of racial anarchy 
U||which is now chronic in European Turkey? And can 
U||we contemplate with equanimity the prospect of having 
U||in such an emergency to intervene with Germany for 
U||the protection of our joint railway interests amidst war- 
U||ring Kurds and Arabs, Turks and Armenians? Has 
U||Germany ever shown any disposition to deviate, how- 
U||ever slightly, out of consideration for us, from her policy 
U||of constant subserviency to her Eastern neighbour in 
U||every phase and every branch of the Eastern question ? 
U||And if not, why should we cheerfully share with her, 
U||and perhaps give her an opportunity of unloading 
U||altogether upon our shoulders, the burden of potential 
U||complications with Russia in which she sees clearly 
U||and anxiously enough that this scheme may sooner 
U||or later involve her? Are there not causes enough of 
U||friction, if not of conflict, between Russia and ourselves 
U||in other parts of Asia, where we have much more vital 
U||interests to defend, without wilfully creating a fresh 
U||THE COST OF THE SCHEME 225 
U||one where our interests are not vitally engaged, in 
U||association with a dubious partner who might at any 
U||moment leave us in the lurch, not necessarily from bad 
U||faith, but under the inexorable pressure of threatening 
U||events in Europe? It has, I know, been urged that 
U||with French co-operation in addition to our own there 
U||would be little danger, either of Russian jealousy, or 
U||of overwhelming German preponderancy. But even if 
U||the permanency of French co-operation were assured, 
U||it would be a very different sort of co-operation from that 
U||which is expected of this country. It would amount to 
U||nothing more than financial co-operation based upon the 
U||community of certain financial interests in France and 
U||in Germany which I have already explained. It will 
U||be time to place French co-operation on the same level 
U||of political significance as British co-operation when 
U||the French Government has been asked and has agreed 
U||to give official assurances ever so remotely analogous 
U||to those required from the British Government. 
U||Financially and commercially the scheme is equally 
U||open to very grave objections. Twenty million pounds 
U||is a low estimate of its cost. That it will pay as a 
U||business venture, except possibly in a remote future,* 
U||very few, even amongst German enthusiasts, are bold 
U||enough to assert. For many years it must be largely 
U||dependent upon the kilometric guarantees which it is 
U||to receive from the Turkish Government. It is there- 
U||fore based in the main upon Turkish credit. Is that 
U||a satisfactory security upon which to encourage the 
U||investment of British capital? The great financial 
U||houses that are in the habit of promoting similar under- 
U||takings may see their way to a remunerative operation. 
U||But how about the British public, out of whose pockets 
U||the money will eventually have to come? Difficulties 
U||Q 
U||226 ENGLAND AND THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 
U||may, and probably will, not arise at first. The next 
U||two or three sections of the line beyond Konia, like the 
U||existing Anatolian lines, may yield sufficient revenue 
U||to enable Turkey to bear the financial burden she has 
U||taken on to her shoulders. The crux will come when, 
U||after the costly work of crossing the Taurus mountains, 
U||the railway descends into the arid wastes of the Upper 
U||Euphrates and Tigris. Then if the Turkish Govern- 
U||ment should happen to default, we should have to face 
U||the alternative of taking some action, either in concert 
U||with others, or alone, for the protection of the British 
U||investor, or of leaving him to his fate, even though 
U||he had invested his money on the faith of official 
U||assurances that the construction of the railway was a 
U||matter of national interest. 
U||The crux^ moreover, will come just when the railway 
U||passes out of what must be regarded as the special 
U||sphere of Germany’s commercial interests. Asia Minor 
U||proper is the field to which the Germans chiefly look 
U||for the expansion of their trade. It is there that 
U||commercially they will reap the chief benefit from the 
U||railway. We shall doubtless also to some extent share 
U||in it there. But if the proposed railway is destined to 
U||serve British commercial interests on any scale that 
U||would compensate us, for instance, for an increase of 
U||the Turkish import duties, that will be not in Asia 
U||Minor, but at the other end of the line, when it reaches 
U||the Mesopotamian delta and the Persian Gulf. There 
U||unquestionably British trade, as I have pointed out in 
U||a preceding chapter, has long felt the need of a railway, 
U||and to secure it we might well run some risks and 
U||make some sacrifices. But, as if to furnish a complete 
U||reductio ad ahsurdutu of the vaunted parity of treat- 
U||ment of British interests under the proposed Baghdad 
U||DECLINED WITH THANKS 
U||227 
U||Railway scheme, it is formally stipulated in the Con- 
U||stantinople Convention between the Porte and the new 
U||Company that the sections of the great trunk line in 
U||which we are specially interested, viz. between Baghdad 
U||and the Persian Gulf, are not to be opened to traffic 
U||until every other section from Constantinople down to 
U||Baghdad has been completed. This was palpably a 
U||stipulation in restraint of British trade. Had we be- 
U||come a party to it, we should have been helping 
U||Germany to open up Asia Minor, where she would be 
U||the chief gainer, and to carry the^ railway through a 
U||great tract of unremunerative country, before we were 
U||allowed to tap the fertile regions of Mesopotamia from 
U||our own base on the Persian Gulf. Such a self-denying 
U||ordinance would have been no less prejudicial to our 
U||political than to our commercial interests. 
U||Fortunately the British Government ultimately decided 
U||to reject the German proposals, and on April 23rd Mr. 
U||Balfour announced that he and his colleagues had come 
U||to the conclusion that those proposals did not give this 
U||country sufficient security for equal powers of control, 
U||constructions, and management, and that the assur- 
U||ances asked for could not therefore be given. It does 
U||not, however, appear from the Prime Minister's state- 
U||ment, or from any other ministerial utterances, that the 
U||Government had even then realised the broader aspects 
U||of the question upon which I have ventured to lay 
U||special stress. No doubt, apart from all other con- 
U||siderations, the object which the Government had had 
U||in view was a very proper one, namely, as Mr. Balfour 
U||himself explained it, “to place the railway, including 
U||the existing Anatolian Railway, throughout its whole 
U||length from sea to sea, under international control, and 
U||to prevent the possibility of preferential treatment for 
U||228 ENGLAND AND THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 
U||the goods or subjects of any country.” But even if 
U||this object could have been achieved, the political, 
U||financial, and commercial objections which go to the 
U||root of the question would not have been at all 
U||adequately met. 
U||It can only be hoped that they will be more fully 
U||appreciated in responsible quarters whenever the 
U||British Government are again approached on the sub- 
U||ject. That they will be again approached may be taken 
U||for granted. The same reasons which induced the 
U||Germans to solicit British co-operation this year will 
U||hold good in the future. For those reasons are not 
U||merely financial, though even from the financial point 
U||of view, German assertions that all arrangements have 
U||been made and will be carried out with or without us 
U||cannot be accepted quite so unreservedly as Mr. Balfour 
U||would have had us accept them. The change which 
U||has already come over the French attitude towards the 
U||scheme since the British Government rejected the 
U||German proposals is in itself significant enough. The 
U||Germans are tenacious people, and they will be careful 
U||not to betray their disappointment. Their cue is, of 
U||course, to proceed with the construction of the railway 
U||without displaying any concern about the future. They 
U||are, in fact, doing so, and we may be prepared to see 
U||the next two or three sections beyond i^onia built with- 
U||out a hitch. But sooner or later they will have to face 
U||the difficulties to overcome which they wanted, and 
U||will still continue to want, our help. 
U||When that day comes, must our reply be an uncon- 
U||ditional nonpossumus? By no means, if our interests 
U||are properly safeguarded — not merely our interests in 
U||the railway itself as a business undertaking, but our 
U||Imperial interests in the regions which it specially 
U||A PRACTICAL SOLUTION 
U||229 
U||affects. For that purpose it may be suggested that 
U||instead of seeking to secure a theoretical equality of 
U||rights over a great trans-continental railway along 
U||which the interests of the different parties must neces- 
U||sarily be distributed unequally, we should try to secure 
U||parity of treatment by the mutual recognition of pre- 
U||ponderating interests in the various regions which it 
U||traverses. Germany’s interests, and such French finan- 
U||cial interests as are bound up with hers, centre in Asia 
U||Minor, Ours centre in the Mesopotamian delta. Let 
U||us have the construction, management, and control of 
U||the railway on conditions to be mutually agreed upon, 
U||from the Persian Gulf up to Baghdad, including the 
U||branch line to the Persian frontier at Khanikin. Let 
U||the others have the same rights on similar terms with 
U||regard to the rest of the line from Constantinople 
U||downwards. We could push on from our base, whilst 
U||the others pushed on from theirs, and when the junction 
U||was once effected, the whole line could be worked on 
U||the basis of a joint traffic agreement, and for the 
U||common financial and commercial benefit of all the 
U||partners. Such a scheme would largely diminish the 
U||danger of international friction, and while there would 
U||be a complete fusion of common interests, such as the 
U||creation of a great international highway demands, the 
U||special interests of each partner would be localised 
U||within the area which afforded the greatest facility for 
U||their protection. There may be other solutions, but 
U||this is at least a practical solution which, without doing 
U||any prejudice to the legitimate interests of others, 
U||would serve, not to extend our responsibilities indefi- 
U||nitely, but to consolidate our own legitimate interests 
U||within their natural field of political and commercial 
U||development. 
U||CHAPTER XX 
U||KOWEYT 
U||T he name of Koweyt was almost unknown to the 
U||present generation outside the Persian Gulf until 
U||it sprang into notoriety as the coveted terminus of the 
U||proposed German railway from Constantinople to 
U||Baghdad. Our own dreams of a British-built railway 
U||down the Euphrates valley vanished so long ago 
U||that few Englishmen probably recollect that, under the 
U||alternative name of Grane, from the resemblance to a 
U||pair of horns — in Arabic Karnein — which the curve 
U||of the bay presents, it was recommended in General 
U||Chesney’s scheme as the best terminus for a railway 
U||to the Gulf. Even in the Gulf it was known but to 
U||few Europeans, as, although the best, though not, 
U||perhaps, as was at first believed, the only natural 
U||harbour in those waters, it offered little attraction to 
U||foreign traders, and lay outside the beaten track of 
U||steamers. The opportunities of visiting it are still 
U||few and far between, and I was fortunate to find at 
U||Basra a steamer that was to call in there on her way 
U||down the Gulf. 
U||About eighty miles by land, as the crow flies, from 
U||Basra, and sixty-five miles by sea from the outer bar of 
U||the Shatt-el-Arab, Koweyt lies on the south side of a 
U||bay nearly twenty miles deep and about five miles 
U||230 
U||AN ARAB TOWN 
U||231 
U||broad, which is well sheltered against all but westerly 
U||winds. The mouth of the bay is partially protected by 
U||two low islands, and the approach between shoals and 
U||low-lying sandbanks is not easy, as there are neither 
U||buoys nor lights at present to indicate the channels. 
U||But once inside, there is good and ample anchorage for 
U||all the fleets of the world in from four to nine fathoms of 
U||water, and, in spite of shelving shores, it would require 
U||no excessive expenditure of money or of engineering 
U||skill to make it a really commodious port. The town 
U||itself looks north and fronts the sea on a long ridge 
U||well above the water, whilst at the back it opens straight 
U||out into the spacious desert. The population amounts 
U||now to 15,000 or, at the outside, 20,000 souls, and con- 
U||sists almost exclusively of Arabs, whose tribal ancestors 
U||settled at Koweyt about three centuries ago. Many of 
U||the houses have stone foundations, and though sun- 
U||dried mud is the chief material, and few buildings have 
U||any architectural pretensions, the town presents al- 
U||together an appearance of solidity and prosperity, and 
U||especially of cleanliness, which is in pleasant contrast 
U||to the tumble-down squalor of the Persian towns of the 
U||Gulf. The bazaars are of considerable extent, and 
U||though to European eyes poorly stocked, they do a 
U||remunerative business with the caravans which come 
U||in from the desert to exchange the produce of the 
U||interior for the few imported luxuries of Beduin life. 
U||With the exception of a few date palms at Jehara, 
U||where the Sheikh has an inland residence, and one 
U||solitary tree that serves as a landmark for mariners 
U||approaching Koweyt from the Gulf, the land produces 
U||nothing, and is absolutely flat, bare, and desolate. So 
U||the main business of Koweyt is, and has always been, 
U||on the sea, for the men of Koweyt have been for 
U||332 
U||KOWEYT 
U||generations a hardy seafaring race, and their dhows, 
U||built in their own primitive yards, ply for trade, not 
U||only all over the Gulf, but into the Indian Ocean and 
U||far up into the Red Sea. 
U||The question of Turkish sovereignty on the Persian 
U||Gulf in its broader aspects can be more conveniently 
U||dealt with when I take a general survey of the situation 
U||in the Gulf. Over Kowe)^, at any rate, the Sultan 
U||never attempted to give practical effect to his shadowy 
U||authority until the German railway schemes drew atten- 
U||tion to the importance it might acquire in the future as 
U||the terminus of a trans-continental railway through his 
U||Asiatic dominions. The Sheikh had the rank of a 
U||Turkish, Kaimakam or local governor, but the title was 
U||regarded as purely honorific, and he was de facto, if not 
U||de jure, an independent ruler. When, in 1898, the 
U||Porte began to show its hand and claimed to bring 
U||Koweyt within the sphere of direct Turkish administra- 
U||tion, the ruling chief. Sheikh Mubarak, on the advice, 
U||it is believed, of his friend, the Sheikh of Bahrein, 
U||appealed to Great Britain as the traditional guardian 
U||of the public peace in the Gulf ; and, taking our stand 
U||on the maintenance of the status quo, we not only 
U||entered a formal protest against any attempt on the 
U||part of Turkey to curtail the Sheikh's authority, and 
U||showed our determination to defend him against any 
U||forcible interference, but concluded, early in 1899, a 
U||definite agreement with him by which his interests 
U||have been permanently placed under our special pro- 
U||tection. At first the Turks seemed, nevertheless, in- 
U||clined to try and carry matters with a high hand. 
U||Troops were from time to time reported to be on the 
U||march overland to occupy Koweyt, and on one occasion 
U||a force was sent down by sea from Basra, which pro- 
U||AN ALTERNATIVE HARBOUR 
U||233 
U||ceeded to another destination when it found three 
U||British men-of-war lying ready for business in the bay. 
U||A modzis vvoendi has now been arrived at, and, so long 
U||as British ships are there to enforce it, the Turks will 
U||probably refrain from any overt act of aggression 
U||against Koweyt itself. But they are evidently bent 
U||upon confining Sheikh Mubarak’s authority within 
U||the narrowest limits possible. On the other side of the 
U||sandy promontory which forms the northern shore of 
U||the bay of Koweyt, there is another deep indenture in 
U||the coast of the mainland. The greater part of this 
U||indenture is occupied by the large, low-lying, and 
U||swampy island of Bubyan ; but to the north-east of this 
U||island, a long and narrow channel runs up inland from 
U||near the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab to Umm Khasa, 
U||where, in former times, a branch of the Shatt poured 
U||itself out into the sea. The Khor Abdallah shows, 
U||according to the charts, four fathoms of water at low 
U||tide, and there is believed to be good anchorage off 
U||Umm Khasa, which is absolutely sheltered. Failing 
U||Koweyt, it might therefore be converted into a harbour, 
U||and serve as a terminus for the Baghdad Railway. 
U||The Turks evidently received a hint to this effect, for 
U||they sent troops in 1902 to garrison Sefwan, about half- 
U||way between Basra and the head of the Khor Abdallah, 
U||and they have established military posts both at Umm 
U||Khasa and on Bubyan Island. They claimed even the 
U||right to occupy Subeya, on the sand-spit to the north of 
U||the bay of Koweyt, but they were not allowed to en- 
U||force their claim. Why the same reasons and the same 
U||arguments to which the Sultan has had to yield with 
U||regard to Koweyt should not have applied equally to 
U||other points of the coast, over which his rights of 
U||sovereignty are just as shadowy, it is difficult to see. 
U||234 
U||KOWEYT 
U||We may yet have cause to regret the consequences of 
U||this seemingly inexplicable inconsistency. 
U||The position is, in other respects also, not altogether 
U||satisfactory. Sheikh Mubarak is the third son of the 
U||late Sheikh Muhammed es-Sebah, and he only succeeded 
U||in 1896 upon the death of his two elder brothers, who 
U||were murdered in one of those feuds which are gener- 
U||ally of common occurrence in the families of petty Arab 
U||chieftains, but from which the records of the ruling 
U||family at Koweyt had hitherto been creditably free. The 
U||rulers of Koweyt appear indeed to have been an ex- 
U||ceptionally long-lived race, and the present Sheikh's 
U||grandfather was certainly something more than a 
U||centenarian. Colonel Pelly, who was Resident in the 
U||Gulf in the sixties and twice visited Koweyt, reports a 
U||conversation, in the course of which the then Sheikh 
U||said to him : When my father was nearly a hundred 
U||and twenty years old he called me and said, ‘ I shall 
U||soon die. I have made no fortune and can leave you 
U||no money. But I have made many true friends ; 
U||grapple them ; while other states have fallen off around 
U||the Gulf from injustice or ill-government, mine has 
U||gone on increasing. Hold to my policy ; and though 
U||you are surrounded by a desert and pressed on by a 
U||once hostile and still wandering set of tribes, you will 
U||still flourish.”' The present Sheikh has broken with 
U||the traditions of his family in the methods he adopted to 
U||secure for himself the possession of power, and he has 
U||had to reap in this respect what he sowed. The three 
U||sons of the two murdered men are naturally at deadly 
U||feud with their uncle, and he has another powerful 
U||enemy in one Jusef el Ibrahim, who is connected with 
U||him by marriage and acted as treasurer to his .pre- 
U||decessor, with results which Mubarak, when he rose 
U||GULF ARABS 
U||A RAID THAT FAILED 
U||235 
U||to power, found so little to his liking that the unjust 
U||steward thought it advisable to take refuge in flight. 
U||Jusef el Ibrahim and the three nephews sought protec- 
U||tion with the Turks ; and, though Mubarak was at 
U||first in excellent odour with the authorities of the 
U||vilayet and received from them the honorific title of 
U||Kaimakam, they rapidly transferred their favours to 
U||his rivals when he began to resist their encroach- 
U||ments and courted British support. Thus, while the 
U||Turks were pushing their military posts forward in 
U||the direction of Koweyt, the pretenders carried on their 
U||plots of revenge against Mubarak with the full cogni- 
U||sance, if not with the active assistance, of the Ottoman 
U||authorities. Jusef el Ibrahim was recognised by them 
U||as Sheikh of Dorah, on the Turkish bank of the Tigris 
U||just above Fao, and it was from Dorah that, early in 
U||September, 1902, he boldly equipped a raiding expedi- 
U||tion for the capture of Koweyt by sea. 
U||Two armed dhows with some hundred and fifty men, 
U||amongst them one of Mubarak’s nephews, Hamud Ibn 
U||Jerah, were to make a descent in the dead of night 
U||upon Koweyt by water, whilst another body of partisans 
U||with one of the other nephews, Khalid Ibn Muhammed, 
U||were to co-operate by land. Mubarak received timely 
U||warning, and though the two dhows actually slipped 
U||into the harbour and landed two spies, they got wind of 
U||the preparations made for their reception and beat a 
U||hasty retreat. H.M.S. Lapsing also arrived during 
U||the night, and though the warning she had come to 
U||convey had already reached the Sheikh from native 
U||sources, she was able on the following morning to dis- 
U||cover the raiding dhows off one of the sandbanks out- 
U||side Koweyt, and cut off their retreat up the river. On 
U||sighting them Captain Armstrong sent off a cutter to 
U||236 
U||KOWEYT 
U||challenge them. As they hoisted no colours, and threat- 
U||ened to open fire if the man-of-war's boat drew nearer — 
U||thus committing an overt act of piracy on the high seas 
U||— the commander of the Lapwing manned his other boats 
U||and gave chase to them, he himself leading the way in 
U||the gig. Cut off from the river, the raiders made for 
U||the Persian coast, and, being hard pressed, they aban- 
U||doned their dhows and fled across a mud-bank into 
U||some long grass, whence they opened a murderous fire 
U||upon the gig’s crew as Captain Armstrong came up in 
U||hot pursuit to seize the derelict craft. One bluejacket 
U||was killed and two were wounded, and the commander 
U||himself had a narrow escape. Indeed, the consequences 
U||might well have been more serious had the Arabs, who 
U||were firing at very short range, made better practice. But 
U||our men replied vigorously, and as the Lapwing^s other 
U||boats were drawing up in support, the Arabs soon dis- 
U||persed on to the mainland and the Lapwing returned to 
U||Basra with her prizes. The details of this story deserve 
U||to be noted not so much because it is one of the many 
U||little adventures of ready pluck which too often pass un- 
U||recorded in the workaday life of the British Navy, but 
U||because it illustrates the peculiar difficulties of the situa- 
U||tion in regard to Koweyt. 
U||Ample evidence was produced that the expedition 
U||had been organised in Turkish territory, and there 
U||were trustworthy witnesses to speak to the names of 
U||those principally responsible for it. In fact, all the 
U||details were the subject of common gossip in the 
U||bazaars of Basra. Yet the Turkish authorities con- 
U||tinued for a long time to affect scepticism and in- 
U||difference, and they took no steps either to bring the 
U||offenders to book or to prevent a recurrence of similar 
U||undertakings, though the raid was organised under 
U||SHEIKH MUBARAK 
U||237 
U||their very eyes against a native chief who was known 
U||to enjoy the protection of Great Britain, and, in the 
U||repression of an audacious act of piracy, there had 
U||been loss of life to a British man-of-war. The Vali 
U||of Basra certainly did not take upon himself the 
U||responsibility of adopting an unfriendly attitude in 
U||so serious a matter, and he was evidently acting upon 
U||instructions from Constantinople, where the support 
U||of Germany with regard to anything connected with 
U||Koweyt seems to be taken, it must be hoped too 
U||confidently, as a foregone conclusion. The necessary 
U||pressure was, however, ultimately applied to the Porte, 
U||for, neither in connection with our police work in the 
U||Gulf could we allow the killing of a bluejacket to be 
U||condoned, nor with regard to the security of Koweyt 
U||could we allow conspiracies of such a nature to be 
U||hatched with impunity. The authorities at Basra sent 
U||up the papers in the case to the Court of Appeal at 
U||Baghdad, and, what is more important than that purely 
U||formal satisfaction, Jusef el Ibrahim and the Sheikh’s 
U||recalcitrant nephews received a hint that they had better 
U||make themselves scarce. One story is that they went 
U||on pilgrimage to Mecca, another that they joined Ibn 
U||Rashid in the Jebel Shammar. At any rate, they 
U||disappeared. 
U||Sheikh Mubarak is a man advancing in years, though 
U||if, as he told me, he is really seventy, he looks, I must 
U||say, very young and robust for his age. He was loud 
U||in his protestations of confidence in Great Britain, and 
U||he pointed with pride to the portraits of the King and 
U||Queen and of her late Majesty, which adorn the walls 
U||of his favourite chamber, high up above the sea, 
U||whence he can watch the goings and comings of 
U||his seafaring people, and sometimes, perhaps, descry 
U||338 
U||KOWEYT 
U||with a comfortable sense of relief the welcome smoke 
U||of a British gunboat entering the bay. He is a shrewd 
U||old Arab, and he no doubt quite realises that he has 
U||compromised himself hopelessly with the Turks. So 
U||long as he lives we can probably rely on his fidelity 
U||to the engagements he has contracted towards us, and 
U||we can, of course, uphold his authority, as part and 
U||parcel of the stattcs qm on which we take our stand. 
U||But if he in turn falls a sudden victim to one of those 
U||feuds which cause so much mortality amongst Arab 
U||chieftains, or even if he is allowed to die peacefully 
U||in his bed, what is to happen should his successor 
U||prefer to accept all the consequences of the Sultan’s 
U||sovereignty which Mubarak himself has, it must be re- 
U||membered, repudiated only on second thoughts? In 
U||a few hours the Turks might be installed in Koweyt, 
U||and what would then be our position, with a new 
U||Sheikh who declined our “special protection,” and 
U||with the Porte, which has never formally recognised 
U||it? Even in Mubarak’s lifetime our present amorphous 
U||relations to Koweyt may place us at any moment in an 
U||awkward predicament. In accordance with their usual 
U||practice, the Turks, when Mubarak fell out with them, 
U||sought to mobilise the Emir of Nejd, Abdul Aziz 
U||Ibn Rashid, against him, and Mubarak replied by 
U||taking up the cause of the Wahabis, whose power 
U||has revived since the death of the present Emir’s uncle, 
U||Muhammed Ibn Rashid, the well-known Sheikh of the 
U||Jebel Shammar. After some preliminary successes 
U||Mubarak and his allies were severely defeated (March 
U||17th, 1901) by the Emir of Nejd near Aneyza, and one 
U||of Mubarak’s younger brothers, Hamud, fell in battle, 
U||together with several other leading men of Koweyt. 
U||In 1902, however, the fortunes of war were more pro- 
U||ARAB WARFARE 
U||239 
U||pitious, and Abdul Aziz I bn Abdur Rahman, a grand- 
U||son of the blind old Emir Feysal Ibn Saud, whom 
U||Muhammed Ibn Rashid treacherously dispossessed, 
U||took his revenge upon the usurper’s successor by 
U||seizing the stronghold of Riad, which he has held ever 
U||since. Immediately after this success large numbers 
U||of tribesmen flocked to his standards, and though Ibn 
U||Rashid moved out against him again in the spring of 
U||1903? he had to retire without venturing any serious 
U||attack. Both the Turks and ourselves have undertaken 
U||to discourage this intertribal warfare ; and though they 
U||may not carry out their undertaking very scrupulously, 
U||they will certainly protest vehemently if their proteges 
U||get seriously worsted. But in the present state of 
U||things it is difficult to exercise any effective control 
U||over Mubarak’s action in that direction, for he knows, 
U||or believes, that we are bound to support him in 
U||Koweyt whatever happens in the interior, where the 
U||rights and wrongs of the case can never be established 
U||on really trustworthy evidence. 
U||Is it, moreover, likely, that apart from any difficulties 
U||which the Turks may raise, the status of a place which 
U||has already acquired a certain measure of international 
U||importance will be allowed to remain as undefined as it 
U||is at present? International law has shown itself of 
U||late years so adaptable to novel situations that it should 
U||not be impossible to discover some formula which 
U||would effectually cover our relations with Koweyt. 
U||But no time should be lost in discovering it. Otherwise 
U||we may find ourselves compelled to define the status 
U||of Koweyt in circumstances less favourable to our 
U||present contention that we are merely maintaining the 
U||status qtio. Sheikh Mubarak has been visited in turn 
U||by the Russian consuls at Baghdad and at Bushire, and 
U||240 
U||KOWEYT 
U||he told me that they were both very anxious to impress 
U||upon him the advantages of Russian friendship and 
U||protection. These visits of Russian consuls and 
U||Russian men-of-war certainly do not take place in our 
U||interest, nor, if one may judge from the view generally 
U||taken in Russia of German railway schemes in Asia, 
U||in the interest of Germany ; and though it would be 
U||foolish to overrate their significance, they show that the 
U||situation at Koweyt is being watched pretty closely by 
U||European diplomacy. It is being watched equally 
U||closely by all the other independent or quasi-indepen- 
U||dent rulers on the littoral of these waters, who, like 
U||Mubarak, have thrown in their lot with Great Britain. 
U||One of the first questions put to me by the Sultan 
U||of Muscat when I saw him a few days after I had been 
U||with Sheikh Mubarak was about the situation at 
U||Koweyt. The position we occupy all over the Persian 
U||Gulf is a very peculiar one, and it closely affects the 
U||credit and the interests of our Indian Empire. It is 
U||possibly — perhaps not improbably — in connection with 
U||Koweyt that it will for the first time be seriously 
U||challenged, and it behoves us to make up our minds 
U||in good time how we should meet such a challenge. 
U||CHAPTER XXI 
U||OUR RECORD IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
U||I N a very remarkable article published in the 
U||National Remew of September, 1902, Captain 
U||Mahan summed up his views of British policy with 
U||regard to the Persian Gulf in the following sentence : 
U||‘‘Concession in the Persian Gulf, whether by formal 
U||arrangement [with other powers], or by neglect of the 
U||local commercial interests which now underlie political 
U||and military control, will imperil Great Britain's naval 
U||situation in the Farther East, her political position in 
U||India, her commercial interests in both, and the Im- 
U||perial tie between herself and Australasia.’’ So definite 
U||a pronouncement by perhaps the greatest authority on 
U||sea-power, writing, moreover, on this question with the 
U||complete impartiality of an American, could not be 
U||dismissed as mere idle panic-mongering, even by the 
U||staunchest advocates in this country of a policy of self- 
U||effacement. The English critics who demurred to his 
U||main conclusions took refuge, for the most part, in 
U||the contention that, as the Persian Gulf is an open 
U||sea to whose shores we hold no territorial title, we 
U||could not oppose the occupation of any part of it by 
U||another power acting in agreement with the titular 
U||owners, without the assumption on our part of a 
U||privileged position in, and of special rights over, its 
U||R 241 
U||242 OUR RECORD IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
U||waters for which there would be neither precedent nor 
U||justification. 
U||Such a claim might, indeed, be unprecedented ; 
U||but so also are the circumstances of the case. Any- 
U||one who has visited the Persian Gulf and studied 
U||the peculiar position we occupy there to-day, together 
U||with the events which have led up to it, would, I 
U||think, be puzzled to find even a distant parallel to it. 
U||In what other sea has a power with no territorial 
U||title to its shores discharged for a whole century 
U||all the duties which accompany territorial ownership, 
U||and which, had we not undertaken to discharge 
U||them, would have remained undischarged? Or what 
U||other power would have so discharged them without 
U||seeking a single exclusive advantage for itself in return 
U||for the sacrifices of life and treasure which it had thus 
U||incurred ? If the Persian Gulf is to-day in the fullest 
U||sense an open sea to which the commerce and shipping 
U||of all nations have liberty and security of access on any 
U||errand of peace, it is so solely as the result of a century 
U||of British effort. 
U||In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the 
U||Persian Gulf was the arena of successive conflicts 
U||between the early pioneers of East Indian adventure— 
U||Portuguese, Dutch, French, British ; but at the begin- 
U||ning of the nineteenth century the European factories 
U||which they had in turn established at different points 
U||of the coast had disappeared, and a long period of 
U||internal turmoil in Persia had reduced to a mere 
U||shadow the authority of the only Oriental monarchy 
U||which had ever exercised effective power on its shores. 
U||The whole littoral north and south from the mouth of 
U||the Tigris to the Indian Ocean was in the hands of 
U||petty Arab rulers, who were either independent tribal 
U||THE PIRATE DAYS 
U||243 
U||chieftains or yielded merely some nominal allegiance. 
U||Almost all these Arab tribes, settled from more or less 
U||remote periods along the Gulf, had imported on to its 
U||waters the predatory habits of the desert. Their armed 
U||dhows scoured the Gulf and its approaches, and had 
U||grown almost as formidable to peaceful mariners as 
U||were ever the Barbary corsairs. Of the magnitude of 
U||the task upon which Great Britain entered when she 
U||undertook to restore peace and order in those lawless 
U||waters some idea may be gathered from the fact that 
U||within little more than one decade, between 1810 
U||and 1821, besides the naval forces constantly main- 
U||tained in active service, three large military expeditions, 
U||one of them of 3,500 men, had to be despatched from 
U||India before the Jowasmi corsairs were subdued, and 
U||a decisive blow dealt to the prestige and popularity 
U||of piracy. Several decades more elapsed before the 
U||Arabs were taught to prefer the peaceful ventures 
U||of trade and of pearl fishing to the more exciting 
U||pursuits of slave-raiding and buccaneering. 
U||Even now it requires the vigilance of the ubiquitous 
U||British gunboat to prevent sporadic outbreaks of the 
U||old predatory instinct, for though both Persia and 
U||Turkey have been prompt enough to take advantage 
U||of the work of pacification done by British hands along 
U||the coast, and to demand recognition of their authority 
U||from the tribes whose powers of armed resistance we 
U||had already broken, neither of them has been able or 
U||willing to afford the slightest effectual co-operation in 
U||securing the peace of the sea. To the present day not 
U||only is every merchantman that plies for trade, what- 
U||ever his flag may be, indebted to the police work 
U||patiently accomplished by generations of British ships 
U||for that peaceful access to peaceful markets which he 
U||244 OUR RECORD IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
U||now enjoys as a matter of course, but he owes equally 
U||to their labours everything that has been done to 
U||diminish the natural perils and difficulties of naviga- 
U||tion. The only surveys upon which the greater part 
U||of his charts have been compiled have been carried out 
U||by the British Navy or the Indian Marine. A British 
U||company, the British India Steam Navigation, has laid 
U||the only buoys which mark practicable channels and 
U||safe anchorages, and keeps up the only beacons which 
U||yet light the chief roadsteads. The Indian Government 
U||have laid and maintained the only cables by which tele- 
U||graphic communication can be had with the outer world. 
U||When a Russian man-of-war visits Bunder Abbas to 
U||study the possibility of converting it into another Port 
U||Arthur, when a French squadron goes to Muscat to 
U||intimidate one of our oldest allies into the cession of 
U||a coaling station, or when German engineers come 
U||down to the Gulf to prospect for a terminus to the 
U||Baghdad Railway, they are each and all drawing upon 
U||the accumulated work of British pioneers in these 
U||strange and inhospitable waters. It is, above all, the 
U||pax Britannica we have laboriously established on land 
U||arnd on water up and down the whole coast which has 
U||restored, with the industries of peace, whatever measure 
U||of prosperity the native population now enjoys, and 
U||revived the internal and external trade in which the 
U||enterprise of all nations is free to take a share. 
U||It is impossible to estimate the actual cost in money 
U||and in blood at which that pax Britannica has been 
U||established, but when one considers the naval ex- 
U||penditure it has annually involved for over a hundred 
U||years, the military expeditions it has from time to 
U||time necessitated, the political establishments, whose 
U||work largely consists in securing the observance of the 
U||OUR SELF-DENYING ORDINANCE 
U||245 
U||many covenants and treaties under which the tribes 
U||have been bound over to us to keep the peace, or 
U||voluntarily refer their local differences to us for arbitra- 
U||tion and settlement, and last, but not least, the heavy 
U||and often unendurable strain to which the climate of 
U||one of the hottest regions in the world subjects the 
U||constitution of European residents, the cost must un- 
U||questionably have been very great. Yet, great as it 
U||has been, we have derived no material advantages for 
U||ourselves beyond those which British trade and British 
U||shipping can reap from the freedom and security of 
U||commerce and navigation in open competition with 
U||the rest of the world ; we have claimed no direct com- 
U||pensation, no exclusive privileges ; we have not only 
U||refrained from turning to account the absence of any 
U||effective authority along the coast in order to make 
U||territorial acquisitions for ourselves, but, perhaps with 
U||more generosity than wisdom, we have tolerated, 
U||and even encouraged, the establishment of effective 
U||authority by both Turkey and Persia without any 
U||guarantee that it might not be eventually used to our 
U||detriment. 
U||We have acted in this matter solely under a self- 
U||denying ordinance, for the opportunities we have had 
U||in the course of the last hundred years for giving a 
U||territorial sanction to the authority we exercise in the 
U||waters of the Persian Gulf have been unlimited. In 
U||fact, all the way down the Gulf one passes point 
U||after point which we have occupied at some time or 
U||other during the last century, but not one of them have 
U||we retained after the necessity for temporary occupation 
U||appeared to have passed away. Muhammerah and the 
U||lower valley of the Karun river were occupied during 
U||the expedition of 1857, as was also Bushire. The 
U||246 OUR RECORD IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
U||island of Kharak to the north-west of Bushire was 
U||occupied from 1838 to 1842, and again in 1857- Further 
U||down the coast, before coming to Lingah, we pass the 
U||island of Kais, where we had a military station during 
U||the pirate wars early in the last century. On the 
U||island of Kishm, facing Bunder Abbas, an important 
U||military and naval station was established in 1820, and 
U||a company of sepoys was maintained there until 1879) 
U||when we evacuated it, retaining only a small coal depot 
U||at Bassiduh. At the mouth of the Straits of Ormuz, 
U||Jask, the telegraph station to which the Indo-European 
U||cable up the gulf was laid from Gwattur after it was 
U||shifted from Cape Musandim on the opposite coast, 
U||was occupied from 1879 to 1886, but Persia then laid 
U||claim to it, though she had hitherto exercised no vestige 
U||of authority over it, and the garrison was withdrawn 
U||in deference to the policy by which we have helped 
U||to invest Persian rule along the whole coast from the 
U||mouth of the Tigris to the frontiers of Baluchistan with 
U||an effective reality it would never have possessed 
U||without our intervention. Even those points on the 
U||northern littoral which we have never actually occupied 
U||were not so very long ago in the hands of native 
U||rulers, upon whose goodwill we could rely with much 
U||more confidence than on that of the Shah’s satraps. 
U||Lingah, for instance, was governed by an hereditary 
U||sheikh, whose tribe — a branch of the Kowasim Arabs 
U||— had come across from the [opposite coast, until the 
U||Persians seized him by a sudden coup de main in 1889, 
U||and having deported him to Teheran, installed in his 
U||place a deputy of the Governor of Bushire. In the 
U||same way the Government of Bunder Abbas and the 
U||adjoining coast had been since the end of the eighteenth 
U||century in the hands of the Sultan of Muscat, one 
U||LAWLESSNESS IN PERSIAN MEKRAN 247 
U||of the oldest allies of the British Power, but in 1868 
U||Persia, who had been steadily undermining his authority 
U||for many years, took advantage of his troubles in Oman 
U||to deal the last blow and instal a Persian governor with 
U||a Persian garrison. 
U||To the east and south-east of Bunder Abbas, outside 
U||the Persian Gulf, the Shah’s sovereignty extends 
U||nominally all along the shores of the Gulf of Oman, in- 
U||cluding the important Bay of Chahbar, which is already 
U||freely talked of in Russia as the future terminus of a 
U||Russian railway to connect the Trans-Caspian and 
U||Central Asian railways through Eastern Persia with 
U||the open sea. Inland it extends also, through Persian 
U||Mekran and Persian Baluchistan, to the frontiers of our 
U||Indian Empire, which march with Persia from Kuh 
U||Malek-i-Siah, on the watershed of the Helmund, to the 
U||Bay of Gwettur, in the Indian Ocean. But what the 
U||Shah’s sovereignty amounts to in those regions, or would 
U||amount to without our support, may be gathered from 
U||the fact that within the last three years two expeditions 
U||have had to be sent from British Baluchistan to help 
U||him police the country. The story of these two expedi- 
U||tions, which has passed almost unnoticed at home, is so 
U||significant and instructive that it deserves to be briefly 
U||recalled. A notorious outlaw and freebooter — Muham- 
U||med Umar Khan, a member of the powerful Nausher- 
U||wani tribe, of whom Serdar Sir Nauroz Khan of Khoran 
U||is the head — fled a few years ago, in 1898, across the 
U||Persian border, after his grandfather, Mir Baluch Khan, 
U||whom he had joined in a rising against the Khan 
U||of Khelat, the ruling chief of the Baluchistan Protec- 
U||torate, had been defeated and killed by a British force. 
U||Muhammed Umar Khan made his submission in the 
U||following year, but in 1900 he again fled to Persia, and 
U||248 OUR RECORD IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
U||organised on Persian territory a series of raids into 
U||British Mekran, which culminated, in December, 1900, 
U||in a regular attack by a band of some 600 men on the 
U||village of Kantdar, which was taken and looted after 
U||a fight in which the villagers lost severely. Muham- 
U||med Umar and his men got back into Persia with 
U||plunder to the value of 80,000 rupees. Nearly the whole 
U||of his following on this occasion consisted of Persian 
U||subjects and refugees established on Persian territory 
U||between Irafshan and Sarhad, who were led by their 
U||own chiefs and received a share of the spoils. Alto- 
U||gether the damage done to our people by this raid was 
U||estimated at over one lakh and a quarter of rupees, and 
U||it became necessary to take some steps to bring home 
U||to the Persians their responsibility for allowing British 
U||territory to be harried with the aid of their own subjects 
U||from a secure base on Persian soil. 
U||Major Showers, the Political Agent at Khelat, was 
U||therefore sent with an escort of 200 infantry and 
U||some sowars to march up from Gwattur to the 
U||Persian border and subsequently to Dizak, in Persian 
U||Mekran, where he met, in February, 1901, the Persian 
U||Deputy - Governor of Bampur, the nearest Persian 
U||town of any importance. This official had been en- 
U||gaged for nearly a month and a half in trying to 
U||subdue three small forts held by Muhammed Umar’s 
U||people. But though he had two small guns, his 
U||nondescript following of Persian soldiers had made no 
U||impression upon them. Major Showers immediately 
U||made preparations to escalade them, but the rebels 
U||knew the difference between the Shah’s soldiery and 
U||Anglo-Indian troops, and made haste to surrender. 
U||Unfortunately, the hot weather was already approach- 
U||ing. Major Showers and his men had a march of 480 
U||A PLUCKY FEAT OF ARMS 
U||249 
U||miles before them back to Quetta, and the capture and 
U||punishment of Muhammed Umar and his chief ad- 
U||herents had to be postponed till the following year. 
U||The Persian Government was in the meantime invited 
U||to send a responsible official with the necessary force to 
U||meet a British expedition on the border and settle all 
U||matters in dispute. Vigorous action was obviously 
U||necessary, as Muhammed Umar soon reappeared on 
U||the scene. Two of his brothers seized the fort of Nodiz, 
U||near Turbat-i-Kej in Mekran, and though they were in 
U||turn invested by the Nazim of Mekran, who administers 
U||the country on behalf of the Khan of Khelat, with 
U||about 1,000 Brahui tribesmen, they held out until, 
U||towards the end of December, 1901, the Agent-General 
U||for Baluchistan, Colonel C. E. Yate, with Major 
U||Showers and a small force of 300 infantry of the 27th 
U||Baluch Regiment, fifty men of the Sind Horse, and two 
U||mountain guns under Major Tighe, arrived on the spot. 
U||The fort was at once stormed under Colonel Yate’s 
U||orders, Muhammed Ali, one of Muhammed Umar^s 
U||brothers, and seventeen of his men being killed, and the 
U||rest captured. It was a plucky feat of arms, and the 
U||effect was excellent. Mekran has remained quiet ever 
U||since. But there was still the source of all this trouble 
U||to be dealt with on the Persian side of the frontier. 
U||Major Showers proceeded with his force to Megas, 
U||where he met the Governor-General of Kerman with a 
U||Persian force of 700 infantry, 300 cavalry, a camel 
U||corps, and two small guns. It was then decided to 
U||carry on combined operations for the recovery of com- 
U||pensation for damage done by Muhammed Umar’s 
U||raids into British territory; for the punishment of 
U||the chief leaders — certain Serdars of Megas, Sarhad, 
U||Sargo, and Irafshan ; and for the capture, if possible, 
U||250 OUR RECORD IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
U||of Muhammed Umar himself. It was also agreed that 
U||the forts on the Persian side of the border should 
U||be demolished, that certain important centres should be 
U||garrisoned by Persian troops, that shelter should no 
U||longer be given on Persian soil to outlaws flying from 
U||British territory, and that an annual meeting should 
U||take place between the Persian Deputy-Governor of 
U||Bampur and the Nazim of Mekran for the settlement 
U||of border cases and for concerted measures to restrict 
U||the importation of modern arms of precision. The 
U||combined forces then proceeded against the strong fort 
U||of Megas, which Serdar Shah Jehan was still holding. 
U||He quickly made his submission, and paid an indem- 
U||nity of 18,000 rupees, and his fort was levelled to the 
U||ground. Irafshan was surprised after a long night 
U||march, and as the fort which is the principal residence 
U||of Muhammed Umar Khan is in a very difficult and 
U||strong position, it was handed over to the Persians 
U||to be permanently garrisoned. Muhammed Umar him- 
U||self, unfortunately, eluded pursuit, but a move was made 
U||into the Damani country, further north in Sarhad, and 
U||several other chiefs submitted and paid, or engaged to 
U||pay, indemnities for the outstanding instalments of which 
U||the Persian authorities were to be responsible. By the 
U||end of April, 1902, Major Showers’s force had marched 
U||back successfully to Quetta out of Persian Baluchistan 
U||over the Seistan trade route. As soon, however, as our 
U||backs were turned, the Persians allowed Muhammed 
U||Umar to depart unmolested across the Afghan border. 
U||They have now even withdrawn their garrison from 
U||Irafshan, and as the Persian authorities do nothing to 
U||check the importation of arms which are being regularly 
U||smuggled in on the coast of Mekran, especially from 
U||the other side of the Sea of Oman, the country will, no 
U||TURKISH ENCROACHMENTS 
U||251 
U||doubt, before long become once more a hotbed of law- 
U||lessness, in which case the Indian Government will 
U||have to despatch another expedition to restore order 
U||in the territories of our good friend and loyal neigh- 
U||bour, the Shah, and to “save his face” we shall 
U||probably again invite him to send some of his raga- 
U||muflBn regiments to “co-operate” with us. 
U||Thus while her Russian neighbour in the North has 
U||during the last century wrested from Persia her Cauca- 
U||sian provinces, and banished her flag from the Caspian, 
U||we have persistently favoured the extension of her 
U||authority in the South, to the detriment, amongst other 
U||things, of our popularity with the people of the Gulf, 
U||who abhor her rule. The influence which Russia and 
U||Great Britain now respectively wield at Teheran affords 
U||a truly cynical illustration of the relative value of a 
U||policy of masterful treatment as against conciliatory 
U||forbearance in dealing with a corrupt and weak Oriental 
U||monarchy. The latest achievement of the Persian 
U||policy of centralisation in which we have so readily 
U||acquiesced has been the introduction into the Persian 
U||Gulf of a new Customs administration under foreign 
U||control, which is meant to be, and is, openly antagonistic 
U||to British interests. 
U||If Turkey had emulated the example of Persia at an 
U||earlier date, the extension of the Sultan’s authority on 
U||the opposite shores of the Gulf would doubtless have 
U||encountered equally little opposition. For when Midhat 
U||Pasha during his tenure of office as Governor-General 
U||of Baghdad in the early seventies began tentatively to 
U||assert the Sultan’s sovereign rights along the littoral, 
U||we seem to have treated the matter with some indiffer- 
U||ence, though we recorded a formal protest against the 
U||occupation of the promontory of El Katr by the Turks 
U||252 OUR RECORD IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
U||in response to the invitation of a lawless local sheikh, 
U||who found the engagements he had already contracted 
U||towards us to be too severe a strain upon his bucca- 
U||neering propensities. At any rate, in the same year the 
U||Turks occupied El Katif and all the adjoining coastline 
U||to the north of Katar and, to consolidate their authority, 
U||founded a maritime Sandjak, or sub-governorship, with 
U||headquarters at El Hofuf, in the El Hasa district, under 
U||a new vali residing at Basra. The energies of the Porte 
U||were, however, soon afterwards absorbed by the crisis 
U||of the Russo-Turkish war, and it was not until 1884 that, 
U||for the second time, the erection of Basra into an inde- 
U||pendent vilayet gave the signal for a revival of Ottoman 
U||pretensions in the Persian Gulf. Though this measure 
U||coincided with the Pan-Islamic propaganda which the 
U||Sultan himself was directing against Great Britain from 
U||the palace at Constantinople, it attracted little attention 
U||at the time, but its effects were not slow to make them- 
U||selves felt. The Turkish authorities, to say the least, 
U||winked at piracy and slave trading, and native dhows 
U||engaged in nefarious practices could always find a safe 
U||refuge in the small creeks and harbours where they were 
U||covered by the Ottoman flag. With the boldness bred 
U||of impunity a regular flotilla of pirate dhows was 
U||actually fitted out in 1895, on the so-called Turkish 
U||coast, to seize the important islands of Bahrein, the 
U||centre of the pearl fisheries of the Gulf, but a British 
U||gunboat appeared opportunely on the scene, and broke 
U||up the expedition in sight of the Turkish officers who 
U||were awaiting on the mainland the successful issue of 
U||the venture, in order to cross over and hoist the Sultan’s 
U||flag. Since that episode the Turks have made no 
U||further attempt to interfere with the independence of the 
U||Sheikh of Bahrein, whose rights we guarantee under a 
U||THE TRUCIAL CHIEFS 
U||253 
U||treaty concluded in 1861. How untoward were to be 
U||the consequences of the indifference with which Turkish 
U||pretensions in the Gulf were originally treated, few 
U||people realised until the Koweyt question imported into 
U||our local differences with Turkey international interests 
U||of a much wider bearing. I have already dealt at length 
U||with the complications to which that question has opened 
U||the door. It may at present be only a cloud no bigger 
U||than a man’s hand, but such clouds are often in these 
U||latitudes the presage of severe storms. 
U||To the south of the territory to which Turkey lays 
U||claim stretches the long line of coast which is still 
U||called the Pirate Coast, though now only in memory of 
U||the past. This was the scene of the severest struggles 
U||we fought as guardians of the peace of the Persian 
U||Gulf, and the loyalty to their engagements of the six 
U||Trucial chiefs who rule over the tribes we forcibly 
U||reclaimed from the wildest outlawry in the first half of 
U||the last century has borne testimony ever since to the 
U||efficiency of a beneficent but vigorous statesmanship. 
U||The whole series of engagements, beginning with the 
U||treaty of 1820, which was merely an initial attempt to 
U||restrain the chiefs from overt acts of piracy, down to 
U||the treaty of 1853, which imposed upon them perpetual 
U||maritime peace, and that of 1873, by which they under- 
U||took to prohibit altogether the traffic in slaves, deserves 
U||to be studied. For it forms a wonderful record of the 
U||perseverance, skill, and intelligence displayed by genera- 
U||tions of devoted Anglo-Indian officials, whose names 
U||may be already forgotten, but whose work still endures. 
U||Still more satisfactory are the relations of friendship 
U||we have maintained without any serious break for up- 
U||wards of a century with the Sultans of Muscat, whose 
U||territory, facing Persian Mekran, commands the 
U||254 OUR RECORD IN THE PERSIAN GULF 
U||western approach to the Gulf. The present Sultan is 
U||the most genial and intelligent of the Arab rulers I 
U||met in those regions, and he does not disguise the 
U||pleasure he takes in friendly intercourse with foreigners. 
U||He had been evidently much flattered by the Viceroy’s 
U||invitation to the Delhi Durbar, and though he could 
U||not himself accept it, as the patriarchal administration 
U||of such states as his imposes upon the ruler a daily 
U||routine far more exacting than the government of more 
U||highly developed and far more powerful states, he did 
U||not hesitate to send his son, a youth of about seventeen, 
U||under the care of the British Resident, Major Cox, 
U||who, during his three years’ tenure of the post, has 
U||gained his complete confidence. 
U||The only other European power besides ourselves 
U||with whom the Sultan of Muscat has come into direct 
U||contact is France, who has had since 1862 a treaty under 
U||which she claims equality of treatment with Great 
U||Britain. But it was not until 1894 that, in response to 
U||pressure from the Colonial party in the Chamber, who 
U||openly urged the necessity of lending Russian influ- 
U||ence in the Persian Gulf the support of French co- 
U||operation, a French Consul was appointed to reside at 
U||Muscat. This was soon followed by an attempt to 
U||obtain the grant of a coaling-station, which might 
U||easily have developed into a naval base, on the coast 
U||of Muscat, but the attempt failed, as it was bound to 
U||fail, since by a treaty concluded with us in 1892 the 
U||Sultan is pledged not to cede any part of his territory 
U||without our consent, and the lease of a small plot of 
U||ground inside Muscat Bay for the erection of a coal- 
U||shed has not quite reconciled the French to their failure. 
U||A still more serious question, because it has been a 
U||source of constantly recurring friction, is that of French 
U||MUSCAT 
U||THE “FRENCH FLAG” QUESTION 
U||2S5 
U||protection for native craft. In a spirit hardly worthy of 
U||a great nation, the French have repeatedly insisted 
U||upon extending, even in Muscat waters, the protection 
U||of the French flag to a number of dhows from one of 
U||the old pirates’ nests on the coast of Muscat, which, 
U||in the course of a more or less suspicious trade, have 
U||obtained immatriculation ” from the French authori- 
U||ties at Obok or Jibuti. These dhows are a thorn in the 
U||flesh to the Sultan, and he cannot understand how the 
U||British Government can tolerate, or the French Govern- 
U||ment encourage, a nuisance so flagrantly at variance 
U||with the professions of all European states concerning 
U||slave trade on the high seas. The question became 
U||very acute a few months after my visit to Muscat, when 
U||in April, 1903, some Arab mariners of Sur, on the 
U||coast of Oman, were arrested by the Sultan’s officials 
U||for a breach of quarantine regulations and other law- 
U||less acts, and a dhow flying, it was alleged, the 
U||French tricolour was fired at. These people at once 
U||claimed French protection, and appealed to the French 
U||Consulate at Muscat. The French flagship Infemet 
U||was at once sent up to demand their release from 
U||the Sultan, who naturally contended that the French 
U||flag, even if his subjects had acquired the right to 
U||hoist it on the high seas, could not confer upon them 
U||immunity from the laws of Muscat in his own territory 
U||or within his own territorial waters. Happily the 
U||question had already for some time past formed the 
U||subject of friendly discussion between the British and 
U||French Governments, and this unpleasant incident 
U||served chiefly to bring home to both sides the urgency 
U||of a permanent settlement. No agreement could, how- 
U||ever, be arrived at as to the principle which should 
U||govern such cases, and the matter has now been 
U||2s6 our record in the PERSIAN GULF 
U||referred to the Hague Court of Arbitration. The Sultan 
U||was, nevertheless, compelled in the meantime to release 
U||the prisoners before the expiration of their sentences, 
U||and they went back to Sur with all the appearances of 
U||a triumph over the authority of Muscat. The question 
U||is not one which merely affects the prestige of the Sultan. 
U||For these so-called French dhows, besides being often 
U||engaged in operations almost undistinguishable from 
U||slave trade, are continually smuggling arms of pre- 
U||cision in very large numbers all along the coast, for the 
U||benefit of the inland tribes always in a state of more or 
U||less open warfare against the Sultan, and of all the 
U||outlaws generally on either shore of the Sea of Oman 
U||and of the Persian Gulf. But when I was at Muscat 
U||it was not to any point connected with his own diffi- 
U||culties that the Sultan chiefly addressed himself in the 
U||course of our conversation. The probing questions 
U||which he put to me with regard to Russian influence 
U||in Persia, German railway schemes, the situation at 
U||Koweyt, and the various recent manifestations of the 
U||growth of new foreign influences in the Persian Gulf, 
U||not only showed him to be observant and well informed, 
U||but they betrayed also the presence in his mind of the 
U||same anxieties with regard to the future — I might 
U||almost say the same sense of grave impending changes 
U||— which prevails to a greater or less degree amongst 
U||the whole native population of that region. 
U||CHAPTER XXII 
U||THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE GULF 
U||T hat the apprehensions with regard to the future 
U||which were shared by natives and Englishmen 
U||alike in Southern Persia and in the Gulf are groundless 
U||only the blindest optimism can maintain. There have, 
U||it is true, been as yet no such profound changes in the 
U||political situation in the South as those which have 
U||placed the North of Persia under the exclusive ascend- 
U||ency of Russia, but the consequences of those changes 
U||in the North are extending all over the South of Persia, 
U||and they are already making themselves felt even in the 
U||Persian Gulf. When I was for the first time in the 
U||Gulf, not yet twenty years ago, there was no sign of any 
U||foreign influence but ours. British influence was not 
U||only paramount, but it was unchallenged. To-day it is 
U||still predominant, but it no longer stands alone, and 
U||it is being openly challenged in more quarters than 
U||one. To the legitimate competition of foreign trade in 
U||the Persian Gulf, as elsewhere, no Englishman can, of 
U||course, take exception. But even if such nominally 
U||commercial ventures as the cruises of heavily subsidised 
U||Russian steamers can rank as legitimate competition, it 
U||is not commercial enterprise that chiefly prompts the 
U||various manifestations of foreign influence which the 
U||last few years have witnessed in the Persian Gulf. 
U||258 THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE GULF 
U||French, German, and Russian Consuls have not been 
U||appointed to reside in Gulf ports, where they for the 
U||most part have practically neither nationals nor trade to 
U||protect, merely for the transaction of ordinary Consular 
U||business, nor is it for the promotion of commerce that 
U||their peripatetic activity is generally displayed on board 
U||a man-of-war. It is not for commercial purposes that 
U||the Russians have from time to time developed such 
U||abnormal interest in the sanitary condition of the Gulf 
U||as to send medical missions, assisted by military and 
U||naval officers, to Bushire and Bunder Abbas, nor that a 
U||French subject, acting as correspondent of Russian 
U||newspapers, conducts from Muscat, under shelter of 
U||extra territorial rights — which the French Consul is 
U||there to uphold — a systematic propaganda amongst the 
U||Arabs of the coast, by means of Arabic leaflets in which 
U||the British and the Sultan of Oman are jointly and 
U||severally traduced and vilified. It is not merely in the 
U||interests of trade that foreign men-of-war have been 
U||sent to cruise ostentatiously in the waters of the Gulf, 
U||and to show their flag to native chiefs who were hitherto 
U||quite content to know only the white ensign of the 
U||British Navy, nor are the recesses of the coast being 
U||explored with a view to the creation of merely com- 
U||mercial harbours. Concurrently with these and many 
U||other novel manifestations of the activity of the Con- 
U||tinental Powers in the Gulf itself, diplomacy works on 
U||parallel lines at Constantinople and at Teheran. We 
U||could, perhaps, afford to treat with indifference the local 
U||influence of Turkey and of Persia on the littoral of the 
U||Gulf, so long as there was nothing more substantial 
U||than their own ambitions behind it, but now that 
U||Turkish policy in the Gulf is liable to be wire-pulled 
U||from Constantinople by Germany, and Persian policy 
U||BIG RAILWAY SCHEMES 
U||2S9 
U||from Teheran by Russia, the action of the two states 
U||for whose assertion of territorial rights we have our- 
U||selves paved the way can no longer be regarded as a 
U||quantite negUgeable. I have already alluded to the two 
U||first results — on the one hand, the aggressive attitude 
U||of the Turks in the neighbourhood of Koweyt, and on 
U||the other, the transfer of the Persian Customs in the 
U||Gulf to a foreign administration antagonistic to British 
U||interests. Other and more serious results can hardly 
U||fail to follow. Big railway schemes are being matured. 
U||The Germans still maintain that, in spite of our refusal 
U||to co-operate with them on the terms they ^^so 
U||generously” offered us, the Anatolian Railway will 
U||eventually be carried down to Baghdad and the Persian 
U||Gulf, and railways, at least in Asia, are, we know, 
U||supposed nowadays to carry with them the right to an 
U||open door on to the sea. Russia has already taken in 
U||hand such a vast programme of railway construction in 
U||Asia that she would prefer to postpone for the present any 
U||extension of her lines into Persia and down to the Gulf, 
U||and she has accordingly closed Persia against all foreign 
U||enterprise for a term which does not expire until 1905, 
U||and will doubtless be then renewed once more if she is 
U||not yet ready for action. But Germany, if she persists 
U||in carrying out her schemes of railway conquest from 
U||Asia Minor, may precipitate Russia’s action there, as 
U||she did in the Far East by the seizure of Kiao-chau. 
U||Whether Russia has actually ^‘ear-marked” Bunder 
U||Abbas or any other port in the Persian Gulf, or whether 
U||she has already come to the conclusion that Bunder 
U||Abbas would prove too hot, just as Vladivostok proved 
U||too cold, for her purpose, and that, upon the same 
U||principle upon which she claimed an ice-free port in the 
U||Pacific, she must insist here on having a port outside 
U||26o the guardianship of the gulf 
U||the fiery furnace of the Gulf and open to the cool sea 
U||breezes of the Indian Ocean, there is very little room 
U||for doubt that, if Germany secures a place for herself in 
U||the fierce sunshine of the Gulf, Russia will be found 
U||fully armed with the Shah’s authority to occupy any 
U||point she may have selected on the Persian littoral. 
U||The French, too, in such a contingency would certainly 
U||not be behindhand in discovering some eligible site for 
U||the naval station they failed to obtain four years ago on 
U||the coast of Muscat. 
U||To the building of railways for genuine commercial 
U||purposes we need assuredly take no exception ; nor to 
U||the opening of commercial ports as an outlet for such 
U||railways. But we have every reason to know, from 
U||recent experience in other parts of the world, what these 
U||peaceful enterprises are apt to develop into, and it is to 
U||be hoped we shall not again commit ourselves to pre- 
U||mature acquiescence. When Mr. Balfour admitted the 
U||reasonableness of Russia’s desire for a warm-water 
U||port as an outlet for her great Siberian railway, he 
U||assuredly never contemplated the creation of a naval 
U||and military stronghold at Port Arthur as the terminus 
U||of an entirely new line of railway dominating Man- 
U||churia. Even those Englishmen who still put their 
U||faith in Germany, and would have us give the Sultan a 
U||free hand at Koweyt for the benefit of his good friend 
U||and brother the Emperor William, would hardly wel- 
U||come the establishment of another Kiao-chau in the 
U||Persian Gulf, Yet the situation in the Persian Gulf 
U||when I visited it for the second time, towards the end of 
U||1902, bore a striking resemblance to the situation in 
U||the Gulf of Pe-chi-li before Germany opened the ball by 
U||occupying Kiao-chau, There were, to a great extent, 
U||the same factors, the same features, the same symptoms 
U||THE BALANCE OF POWER 
U||261 
U||of an impending crisis which had been only too visible 
U||to those who had eyes to see in the Far East when 
U||Japan had once exposed the helplessness of China in 
U||the face of a restless world in search of new fields of 
U||commercial and political exploitation. There were the 
U||same rumours of secret treaties no less plausible in 
U||themselves, no less strongly corroborated by indepen- 
U||dent testimony. They elicited the same official denials, 
U||which were accepted with the same facile optimism. 
U||We talked then about the integrity and independence 
U||of the Chinese Empire, and the maintenance of the 
U||status quo in Far Eastern waters, just as we went on 
U||talking about the integrity and independence of Persia 
U||and the maintenance of the status quo in the Persian 
U||Gulf. Could any British Government, looking back 
U||upon the subsequent course of events in the Far East, 
U||contemplate with equanimity their reproduction in the 
U||Persian Gulf on the very threshold of our Indian 
U||Empire? I will say nothing about the commercial 
U||interests of India, though we know what measure of 
U||fair play they are likely to get under the political 
U||ascendency of our continental competitors, and especi- 
U||ally of Russia, who has hermetically closed against 
U||Indian trade every successive market of which she 
U||has secured the control in Central Asia. For it is not 
U||our commercial supremacy only that would be chal- 
U||lenged if other nations once gained a foothold in the 
U||Persian Gulf. The whole balance of naval and military 
U||power in this part of Asia would inevitably be affected, 
U||and we should have no Japan whom we could call in to 
U||redress it in our favour. To anyone who is at all inti- 
U||mately acquainted with international politics the idea 
U||that we could rely upon the appearance of Germany 
U||on the scene to act as a counterpoise to Russia must 
U||262 THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE GULF 
U||seem quite as futile as that Russia’s policy of expansion 
U||in Asia can be arrested by graceful concessions. India 
U||would for the first time for upwards of a century be 
U||exposed to attack from a naval base within close 
U||proximity to her shores, and though that is a danger 
U||against which she could be protected so long as we 
U||preserve our command of the sea, it would mean an 
U||additional task for our Navy and involve a substantial 
U||increase of the naval force permanently stationed in our 
U||Indian waters. Whatever the sequence in point of 
U||time, and whether the railway came before the port or 
U||the port before the railway, a Russian Port Arthur on 
U||the Persian Gulf would inevitably mean another Man- 
U||churian Railway through Eastern Persia, with all the 
U||consequences which such a railway involves ; and in the 
U||course of a given number of years the whole line of land 
U||defences behind which India has entrenched herself at 
U||such enormous cost of treasure and labour would be 
U||turned, and her resources would have to be strained 
U||afresh to meet a new military situation far more compli- 
U||cated and threatening than any she has yet had to deal 
U||with. And I have suggested so far only the material 
U||effects upon our position in India. Might not the 
U||moral effect be more serious still if our Indian Empire 
U||were subjected to the immediate reaction of every inter- 
U||national complication in which our world-wide interests 
U||must at times involve us ? 
U||It will be said, no doubt, that this is a highly-coloured 
U||picture. But is it an improbable or an impossible one ? 
U||Does it not merely fill in, as it were, with some slight 
U||measure of topographical detail the rough sketch already 
U||drawn in outline by Captain Mahan from a purely 
U||scientific survey of the situation ? He saw ‘ ^the question 
U||of the Persian Gulf, and of South Persia in connection 
U||CAPTAIN MAHAN^S VIEWS 
U||263 
U||with it . . • clearly visible on the horizon.” He analysed 
U||it with his usual perspicacity, and as, on the broader 
U||issues it involves for an empire which rests as our own 
U||does upon sea-power, he writes with an authority I 
U||cannot venture to claim, I may be allowed to quote 
U||his own words : — 
U||^‘By established rule and justice the determination 
U||[of rights and responsibilities] belongs primarily to 
U||those immediately on the spot, in actual possession. 
U||Unhappily the Powers that border the Persian Gulf — 
U||Persia itself, Turkey, and some minor Arabian com- 
U||munities — are unable to give either the commercial or 
U||military security that the situation will require. Under 
U||their tutelage alone, without stronger foundations under- 
U||lying, stability cannot be maintained either by equi- 
U||librium or by predominance. In such circumstances, 
U||and when occasion arises, the responsibility naturally 
U||devolves, as for other derelicts of fortune, upon the 
U||next-of-kin, the nearest in place or interest. . . . Great 
U||Britain, in the clear failure of Turkey and Persia, is 
U||the nation first — that is, most — concerned. She is not so 
U||only in her own right, and that of her own people, but 
U||in the yet more binding one of Imperial obligation to 
U||a great and politically helpless ward of the Empire — to 
U||India and its teeming population. In her own right 
U||and duty she is, as regards the maintenance of order, 
U||in actual possession, having discharged this office to 
U||the Gulf for several generations. Doubtless, here as 
U||in Egypt, now that the constructive work has been 
U||done, she might find others who would willingly 
U||relieve her of the burden of maintenance ; but as 
U||regards such transfer, the decision of acceptance would 
U||rest by general custom with the present possessor, and 
U||to her the question is one not merely of convenience 
U||but of duty, arising from and closely involved with 
U||existing conditions, which are the more imperative 
U||because they are plants of mature growth, with roots 
U||264 THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE GULF 
U||deep struck and closely intertwined in the soil of a past 
U||history. These conditions are doubtless manifold, but 
U||in last analysis they are substantially three. First, her 
U||security in India, which would be materially affected 
U||by an adverse change in the political control of the 
U||Gulf ; secondly, the safety of the great sea route, com- 
U||mercial and military, to India and the Farther East, on 
U||which British shipping is still actually the chief traveller, 
U||though with a notable diminution that demands national 
U||attention ; and, thirdly, the economic and commercial 
U||welfare of India, which can act politically only through 
U||the Empire, a dependence which greatly enhances obli- 
U||gation. The control of the Persian Gulf by a foreign 
U||state of considerable naval potentiality, a fleet in being 
U||there based upon a strong military port, would re- 
U||produce the relations of Cadiz, Gibraltar, and Malta 
U||to the Mediterranean. It would flank all the routes 
U||to the Farther East, to India, and to Australia, the last 
U||two actually internal to the Empire regarded as a 
U||political system ; and although at present Great Britain 
U||unquestionably would check such a fleet, so placed, by 
U||a division of her own, it might well require a detachment 
U||large enough to affect seriously the general strength 
U||of her naval position.” 
U||To this point, and on the lines thus laid down with 
U||so much authority by Captain Mahan, his Majesty’s 
U||Government have addressed themselves, after perhaps 
U||an unnecessarily long period of hesitation, but with 
U||commendable determination. The declaration made 
U||by Lord Lansdowne on May 5th, 1903, marks an 
U||important stage in the question of the Gulf. In reply 
U||to a series of inquiries from Lord Lamington, the 
U||Secretary of State announced that “we [z.e. his 
U||Majesty’s Government] should regard the establishment 
U||of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian 
U||Gulf by any other power as a very grave menace to 
U||LORD LANSDOWNE’S DECLARATION 265 
U||British interests which we should certainly resist with 
U||all the means at our disposal.” That Lord Lansdowne 
U||should at the same time have intimated that he spoke 
U||in no minatory spirit, and that he was not aware of any 
U||proposals on foot for the establishment of a foreign 
U||naval base in the Gulf were, no doubt, merely oratorical 
U||precautions which did not, and were not meant to, 
U||detract from the emphatic warning his words conveyed 
U||to the world at large. The arguments by which he 
U||led up to his declaration of policy were equally sober 
U||and moderate. ‘^It was owing to British enterprise, 
U||to the expenditure of British lives and money, that 
U||the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navi- 
U||gation of the world. It was our ships that cleared 
U||those waters of pirates ; it was we who put down the 
U||slave trade ; it was we who buoyed and beaconed those 
U||intricate waters.” We had so far succeeded in pre- 
U||serving a liberal share of the commerce, and though 
U||we might feel very keenly the competition of other 
U||powers, and could perhaps scarcely hope always to 
U||maintain there or elsewhere the position of superiority 
U||we had acquired as the pioneers of commercial develop- 
U||ment throughout the world, and certainly could not 
U||aim at excluding the legitimate trade of other nations, 
U||he entirely agreed that ‘^this country stands with 
U||regard to the navigation of the Gulf in a position 
U||different from that of any other power,” and that ‘‘our 
U||policy should be directed to protect and promote 
U||British trade in those waters.” 
U||As far as it went it was an admirable exposition of 
U||our rights and obligations. Great Britain still holds 
U||a position of complete pre-eminence in the Persian 
U||Gulf. She holds it under the most honourable of title 
U||deeds, for it is none other than the reign of law and 
U||266 THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE GULF 
U||order she has imposed, and for so many decades upheld 
U||by her own unaided efforts ; to her own benefit no 
U||doubt, but equally to that of the discordant native 
U||races and tribes whom she has reclaimed from lawless- 
U||ness to peaceful pursuits, and of the friendly nations 
U||of the world to whose peaceful enterprise she has 
U||thrown open an unrestricted field. In this sense Great 
U||Britain has made the Persian Gulf an open sea, and 
U||in this sense it will remain so under her guardianship. 
U||But her Imperial interests forbid her to leave it open 
U||to the territorial ambitions of other powers. The self- 
U||denying ordinance she has imposed upon herself in 
U||this respect she has the right to impose upon others, 
U||and the British Government have now given fair warn- 
U||ing that we intend to impose it with all the means at 
U||our disposal.” 
U||Nevertheless, the value of this declaration of policy, 
U||pregnant as it may and should be with important de- 
U||velopments, is in itself negative rather than positive. 
U||It lays down what we shall not tolerate on the part of 
U||others. Even coupled with the explanations, satis- 
U||factory enough as far as they went, which Lord Lans- 
U||downe subsequently gave, of various measures which 
U||are occupying the attention of the Government in 
U||Southern Persia, it gives but an imperfect indication 
U||of what we ourselves ought to do. To quote Captain 
U||Mahan again, he tells us that for the Imperial purposes 
U||he has already enumerated as those we should steadily 
U||keep in view, ‘‘naval predominance in the Gulf un- 
U||fettered by bases there belonging to possibly hostile 
U||foreign powers would be a factor of considerable in-
