U||PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
U||   This volume is intended to be a contribution, though a very slight one
U||   at best, to a special branch of the study of our own language. It
U||   proposes to trace in a popular manner and for general readers the
U||   changes of meaning which so many of its words have undergone; words
U||   which, as current with us as they were with our forefathers, yet meant
U||   something different on their lips from what they mean on ours. Of my
U||   success in carrying out the scheme which I had set before myself, it
U||   does not become me to speak, except to say that I have fallen a good
U||   deal below my hopes, and infinitely below my desires. But of the scheme
U||   itself I have no doubts. I feel sure that, if only adequately carried
U||   out, few works of the same compass could embrace matter of more
U||   manifold[Pg vi] instruction, or in a region of knowledge which it would
U||   be more desirable to occupy. In the present condition of education in
U||   England, above all with the pressure upon young men, which is ever
U||   increasing, to complete their educational course at the earliest
U||   possible date, the number of those enjoying the inestimable advantages,
U||   mental and moral, which more than any other languages the Latin and the
U||   Greek supply, must ever be growing smaller. It becomes therefore a
U||   necessity to seek elsewhere the best substitutes within reach for that
U||   discipline of the faculties which these languages would better than any
U||   other have afforded. And I believe, when these two are set aside, our
U||   own language and literature will furnish the best substitutes; such as,
U||   even though they may not satisfy perfectly, are not therefore to be
U||   rejected. I am persuaded that in the decomposition, word by word, of
U||   small portions of our best poetry and prose, the compensations which we
U||   look for are most capable of being found; even as I have little doubt
U||   that in many of our higher English schools compensations of the kind
U||   are already oftentimes obtained. Lycidas suggests itself to me, in the
U||   amount of resistance which it would offer, as in verse furnishing more
U||   exactly what I seek than any other poem, perhaps some of Lord Bacon’s
U||   Essays in prose.
U||   [Pg vii]
U||   In such a decomposition, to be followed by a reconstruction, of some
U||   small portions of a great English Classic, matters almost innumerable,
U||   and pressing on the attention from every side, would claim to be
U||   noticed; but certainly not last nor least the changes in meaning which,
U||   on close examination, would be seen to have passed on many of the words
U||   employed. It is to point out some of these changes; to suggest how many
U||   more there may be, there certainly are, which have not been noticed in
U||   these pages; to show how slight and subtle, while yet most real, how
U||   easily therefore evading detection, unless constant vigilance is used,
U||   these changes often have been; to trace here and there the progressive
U||   steps by which the old meaning has been put off, and the new put on,
U||   the exact road which a word has travelled; this has been my purpose
U||   here; and I have desired by such means to render some small assistance
U||   to those who are disposed to regard this as a serviceable discipline in
U||   the training of their own minds or the minds of others.
U||   The book is, as its name declares, a Select Glossary. There would have
U||   been no difficulty whatever in doubling or trebling the number of
U||   articles admitted into it. But my purpose being rather to arouse
U||   curiosity than fully to gratify it, to lead others themselves to take
U||   note of changes,[Pg viii] and to account for them, rather than to take
U||   altogether this pleasant labour out of their hands and to do for them
U||   what they could more profitably do for themselves, I have consciously
U||   left much of the work undone, even as, unconsciously no doubt I have
U||   left a great deal more. At the same time it has not been mere caprice
U||   which has induced the particular selection of words which has been
U||   actually made. Various motives, but in almost every case such as I
U||   could give account of to myself, have ruled this selection. Sometimes
U||   the past use of a word has been noted and compared with the present, as
U||   usefully exercising the mind in the tracing of minute differences and
U||   fine distinctions; or, again, as helpful to the understanding of our
U||   earlier authors, and likely to deliver a reader of them from
U||   misapprehensions into which he might else very easily fall; or, once
U||   more, as opening out a curious chapter in the history of manners; or as
U||   involving some interesting piece of history, or some singular
U||   superstition; or, again, as witnessing for the good or for the evil
U||   which have been unconsciously at work in the minds and hearts of those
U||   who insensibly have modified in part or changed altogether the meaning
U||   of some word; or, lastly and more generally, as illustrating well under
U||   one aspect or another those permanent laws[Pg ix] which are everywhere
U||   affecting and modifying human speech.
U||   And as the words brought forward have been selected with some care, and
U||   according to certain rules which have for the most part suggested their
U||   selection, so also has it been with the passages adduced in proof of
U||   the changes of meaning which they have undergone. A principal value
U||   which such a volume as the present can possess, must consist in the
U||   happiness with which these have been chosen. Not every passage, which
U||   really contains evidence of the assertion made, will for all this serve
U||   to be adduced in proof; and this I presently discovered in the many
U||   which for one cause or another it was necessary to set aside. There are
U||   various excellencies which ought to meet in such passages, but which
U||   will not by any means be found in all.
U||   In the first place they ought to be such passages as will tell their
U||   own story, will prove the point which they are cited to prove, quite
U||   independently of the uncited context, to which it will very often
U||   happen that many readers cannot, and of those who can, that the larger
U||   number will not, refer. They should bear too upon their front that
U||   amount of triumphant proof, which will carry conviction not merely to
U||   the student who by a careful observation of many like passages, and
U||   a[Pg x] previous knowledge of what was a word’s prevailing use in the
U||   time of the writer, is prepared to receive this conviction, but to him
U||   also, to whom all this is presented now for the first time, who has no
U||   predisposition to believe, but is disposed rather to be incredulous in
U||   the matter. Then, again, they should, if possible, be passages capable
U||   of being detached from their context without the necessity of drawing a
U||   large amount of this context after them to make them intelligible; like
U||   trees which will endure to be transplanted without carrying with them a
U||   huge and cumbrous bulk of earth, clinging to their roots. Once more,
U||   they should, if possible, be such as have a certain intrinsic worth and
U||   value of their own, independent of their value as illustrative of the
U||   point in language directly to be proved—some weight of thought, or
U||   beauty of expression, merit in short of one kind or other, that so the
U||   reader may be making a second gain by the way. I can by no means claim
U||   this for all, or nearly all, of mine. Indeed, it would have been absurd
U||   to seek it in a book of which the primary aim is quite other than that
U||   of bringing together a collection of striking quotations; any merit of
U||   this kind must continually be subordinated, and, where needful, wholly
U||   sacrificed, to the purposes more immediately in view. Still there will
U||   be many citations[Pg xi] found in these pages which, while they fulfil
U||   the primary intention with which they were quoted, are not wanting also
U||   in this secondary worth.
U||   In my citations I have throughout acted on the principle that ‘Enough
U||   is as good as a feast:’ and that this same ‘Enough,’ as the proverb
U||   might well be completed, ‘is better than a surfeit.’ So soon as that
U||   earlier meaning, from which our present is a departure, or which once
U||   subsisted side by side with our present, however it has now
U||   disappeared, has been sufficiently established, I have held my hand,
U||   and not brought further quotations in proof. In most cases indeed it
U||   has seemed desirable to adduce passages from several authors; without
U||   which a suspicion may always remain in the mind, that we are bringing
U||   forward the exceptional peculiarity of a single writer, who even in his
U||   day stood alone. I suspect that in some, though rare, instances I have
U||   adduced exceptional uses of this kind.
U||   One value I may claim for my book, that whatever may be wanting to it,
U||   it is with the very most trifling exceptions an entirely independent
U||   and original collection of passages illustrative of the history of our
U||   language. Of my citations, I believe about a thousand in all, I may owe
U||   some twenty at the most to existing Dictionaries or Glossaries, to
U||   Nares or Johnson or[Pg xii] Todd or Richardson. In perhaps some twenty
U||   cases more I have lighted upon and selected a passage by one of them
U||   selected before, and have not thought it desirable, or have not found
U||   it possible, to dismiss this and choose some other in its room. These
U||   excepted, the collection is entirely independent of all those which
U||   have previously been made; and in a multitude of cases notes uses and
U||   meanings of words which have never been noted before.

U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   In the present edition the ‘Select Glossary’ has been carefully
U||   revised, and a few of the articles have been rewritten. In the work of
U||   revision special attention has been paid to two points, the etymologies
U||   and the Middle English quotations. The aim of the editor has been to
U||   bring this useful and interesting little book up to date, by purging it
U||   of obsolete or doubtful etymologies, and giving those which commend
U||   themselves to the best modern authorities on the subject. Nearly all
U||   the quotations from the works of Middle English authors have been
U||   collated with the best modern editions, and care has been taken to make
U||   the references in each case as clear and precise as possible. It is
U||   hoped that the Alphabetical Lists of Authors quoted, and of
U||   Philological Works referred to, may be found useful to the student.

U||SELECT GLOSSARY
U||ETC.
U||   [Abandon. Now only used in the sense of to give up absolutely, to
U||   forsake, or desert; but in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
U||   often found in the sense of to put to the ban, to proscribe, to cast
U||   out, reject. O. Fr. abandoner, to give up into the power of another, is
U||   due to the phrase mettre à bandon, to put under anyone’s jurisdiction;
U||   O. Fr. bandon (Low Lat. bandonem) is a derivative of Low Lat. bandum
U||   for older bannum; O. H. G. ban, an order, decree, proclamation. For O.
U||   Fr. bandon, used in the sense of free disposal, unfettered authority,
U||   compare Chanson de Roland, 2703: ‘All Spain will be to-day en lur
U||   bandun,’ i.e. in their power. The Germanic word bann, an open
U||   proclamation, survives in our ‘banns of marriage.’ The word bandit, It.
U||   bandito, means properly a proclaimed, proscribed man.]
U||   Blessed shall ye be when men shall hate you, and abandon your name as
U||   evil [et ejecerint nomen vestrum tanquam malum, Vulg.] for the Son of
U||   man’s sake.—Luke vi. 22. Rheims.
U||   [Pg 2]
U||   Beggar. Madame wife, they say that I have dreamed
U||   And slept above some fifteen years or more.
U||   Lady. Aye, and the time seems thirty unto me,
U||   Being all this time abandoned from thy bed.
U||   Shakespeare, Taming of the Shrew, act i. sc. 1.
U||   Achievement. Of ‘achievement’ and ‘hatchment’ it need hardly be said
U||   that the latter is a contracted and corrupted manner of pronouncing the
U||   former. This ‘achievement’ or ‘hatchment’ is an escutcheon or coat of
U||   arms erected when a person of distinction has died; originally so
U||   called from its being granted in memory of some ‘achievement’ or
U||   distinguished feat. In the Heralds’ College there are ‘achievements’
U||   still, as there were for Milton two centuries ago; but in our common
U||   language we call them ‘hatchments,’ and have let any such employment of
U||   ‘achievement’ go.
U||   As if a herald in the achievement of a king should commit the indecorum
U||   to set his helmet sideways and close; not full-faced and open, as the
U||   posture of direction and command.—Milton, Tetrachordon.
U||   Act. The verb ‘to actuate’ seems of comparatively late introduction
U||   into the language. The first example of it which our Dictionaries give
U||   is drawn from the works of the Latinist, Sir Thomas Browne, of Norwich.
U||   I have also met it in Jeremy Taylor.[274]1 But even for some time after
U||   ‘actuate’ was introduced—as late, we see, as Pope,—‘act’ did often the
U||   work which ‘actuate’ alone does now.
U||   Within, perhaps, they are as proud as Lucifer, as covetous as Demas, as
U||   false as Judas, and in the whole course of their[Pg 3] conversation act
U||   and are acted, not by devotion, but design.—South, Sermons, 1737, vol.
U||   ii. p. 391.
U||   Many offer at the effects of friendship; but they do not last. They are
U||   promising at the beginning, but they fail and jade and tire in the
U||   prosecution. For most people in the world are acted by levity and
U||   humour, and by strange and irrational changes.—Id. Ib., vol. ii. p. 73.
U||   Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul.
U||   Pope, Essay on Man, ep 2.
U||   Adamant. It is difficult to trace the exact motives which induced the
U||   transferring of this name to the lodestone; but it is common enough in
U||   our best English writers, thus in Chaucer, Bacon, and Shakespeare; as
U||   is ‘aimant’ in French, and ‘iman’ in Spanish. See ‘Diamond,’ and the
U||   art. ‘Adamant’ in Appendix A to the Dictionary of the Bible.
U||   Right as an adamaund, iwys,
U||   Can drawen to hym sotylly
U||   The yren, that is leid therby,
U||   So drawith folkes hertis, ywis,
U||   Silver and gold that yeven is.
U||   Romaunt of the Rose, 1182 (ed. Morris).
U||   [Pg 4]
U||   Demetrius. Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
U||   Helena. You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
U||   And yet you draw not iron, for my heart
U||   Is true as steel.
U||   Shakespeare, Midsummer Night’s Dream, act ii. sc. 1.
U||   If you will have a young man to put his travel in little room, when he
U||   stayeth in one city or town, let him change his lodging from one end
U||   and part of the town to another; which is a great adamant of
U||   acquaintance.—Bacon, Essays, 18.
U||   Admiral. This was a title often given in the seventeenth century to the
U||   principal and leading vessel in a fleet; the ‘admiral-galley’ North
U||   (Plutarch’s Lives) calls it.
U||   Falstaff (to Bardolph).—Thou art our admiral; thou bearest the lantern
U||   in the poop—but ’tis the nose of thee; thou art the Knight of the
U||   Burning Lamp.—Shakespeare, 1 Henry IV., act iii. sc. 3.
U||   Lincoln spake what was fit for comfort, and did what he was able for
U||   redress. He looked like the lanthorn in the admiral, by which the rest
U||   of the fleet did steer their course.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop
U||   Williams, part ii. p. 143.
U||   His spear—to equal which the tallest pine
U||   Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast
U||   Of some great ammiral, were but a wand—
U||   He walked with, to support uneasy steps
U||   Over the burning marle.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, i. 292.
U||   The admiral of the Spanish Armada was a Flemish ship.—Hawkins,
U||   Observations, &c., 1622, p. 9.
U||   Admire,    }
U||   Admirable,
U||   Admiration.
U||   It now always implies to wonder with approval; but was by no means
U||   restrained to this wonder in bonam partem of old.
U||   Neither is it to be admired that Henry [the Fourth], who was a wise as
U||   well as a valiant prince, should be pleased to have the greatest wit of
U||   those times in his interests, and to be the trumpet of his
U||   praises.—Dryden, Preface to the Fables.
U||   Let none admire
U||   That riches grow in hell; that soil may best
U||   Deserve the precious bane.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, i. 690.
U||   It may justly seem admirable how that senseless religion [Mahometanism]
U||   should gain so much on Christianity.—Fuller, Holy War, part i. c. 6.
U||   In man there is nothing admirable but his ignorance and
U||   weakness.—Bishop Taylor, Dissuasive from Popery, part ii. b. i. § 7.
U||   I understand that you be in great admirations of me, and take very
U||   grievously my manner of writing to you.—Latimer, Sermons and Remains,
U||   vol. ii. p. 419.
U||   [Pg 5]
U||   And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints ... and when I
U||   saw her I wondered with great admiration.—Rev. xvii. 6. (A.V.)
U||   Alchymy. By this we always understand now the pretended art of
U||   transmuting other metals into gold; but it was often used to express
U||   itself a certain mixed metal, which, having the appearance of gold, was
U||   yet mainly composed of brass. Thus the notion of falseness, of show and
U||   semblance not borne out by reality, frequently underlay the earlier
U||   uses of the word. Compare the second quotation under ‘Bullion.’
U||   As for those gildings and paintings that were in the palace of Alcyna,
U||   though the show of it were glorious, the substance of it was dross, and
U||   nothing but alchymy and cosenage.—Sir J. Harington, A brief Allegory of
U||   Orlando Furioso.
U||   Whereupon out of most deep divinity it was concluded, that they should
U||   not celebrate the sacrament in glass, for the brittleness of it; nor in
U||   wood, for the sponginess of it, which would suck up the blood; nor in
U||   alchymy, because it was subject to rusting; nor in copper, because that
U||   would provoke vomiting; but in chalices of latten, which belike was a
U||   metal without exception.—Fuller, Holy War, b. iii. c. 13.
U||   Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
U||   Put to their mouths the sounding alchymy.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, ii. 516.
U||   Such were his arms, false gold, true alchemy.—P. Fletcher, Purple
U||   Island, vii. 39.
U||   Allow,    }
U||   Allowance,
U||   Allowable.
U||   ‘To allow,’ from the French ‘allouer,’ and through it from the Latin
U||   ‘allaudare,’—and not to be confounded with another ‘allow,’ derived
U||   from another ‘allouer,’ the Latin ‘allocare,’—had once a sense very
U||   often of praise or approval, which may now be said to have[Pg 6]
U||   departed from it altogether. Thus in Cotgrave’s French and English
U||   Dictionary, an invaluable witness of the force and meanings which words
U||   had two centuries ago, ‘allow’ is rendered by ‘allouer,’ ‘gréer,’
U||   ‘approuver,’ ‘accepter,’ and ‘allowable’ by ‘louable.’
U||   Mine enemy, say they, is not worthy to have gentle words or deeds,
U||   being so full of malice or frowardness. The less he is worthy, the more
U||   art thou therefore allowed of God, and the more art thou commended of
U||   Christ.—Homilies; Against Contention.
U||   The hospitality and alms of abbeys is not altogether to be allowed, or
U||   dispraised.—Pilkington, The Burning of Paul’s, § 12.
U||   Truly ye bear witness that ye allow [συνευδοκεῖτε] the deeds of your
U||   fathers.—Luke xi. 48. (A. V.)
U||   A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
U||   Before a sleeping giant.
U||   Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, act ii. sc. 3.
U||   Though I deplore your schism from the Catholic Church, yet I should
U||   bear false witness if I did not confess your decency, which I discerned
U||   at the holy duty, was very allowable in the consecrators and
U||   receivers.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part ii. p. 211.
U||   Amiable. This and ‘lovely’ have been so far differentiated that
U||   ‘amiable’ never expresses now any other than moral loveliness; which in
U||   ‘lovely’ is seldom or never implied. There was a time when ‘amiable’
U||   had no such restricted use, when it and ‘lovely’ were absolutely
U||   synonymous, as, etymologically, they might claim still to be.
U||   Come sit thee down upon this flow’ry bed,
U||   While I thy amiable cheeks do coy.
U||   Shakespeare, Midsummer Night’s Dream, act iv. sc. 1.
U||   How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts.—Ps. lxxxiv. 1. (A.V.)
U||   [Pg 7]
U||   Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,
U||   Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,
U||   Hung amiable.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, iv. 248.
U||   Amuse,     }
U||   Amusement.
U||   The notion of diversion, entertainment, is comparatively of recent
U||   introduction into the word. ‘To amuse’ was to cause to muse, to occupy
U||   or engage, and in this sense indeed to divert, the thoughts and
U||   attention. The quotation from Phillips shows the word in transition to
U||   its present meaning. [O. Fr. amuser is a compound of muser, to muse,
U||   study, linger about a matter, to sniff as a hound, from *muse, a
U||   muzzle, nose of an animal (whence Mod. Fr. museau). Compare Florio’s
U||   Italian Dictionary: ‘Musare, to muse, to muzzle, to gape, to hold one’s
U||   muzle or snout in the air.’ The O. Fr. *muse is the same word as the
U||   Lat. morsus, see Mayhew-Skeat, Dict. of Middle English.]
U||   Camillus set upon the Gauls, when they were amused in receiving their
U||   gold.—Holland, Livy, p. 223.
U||   Being amused with grief, fear, and fright, he could not find a house in
U||   London (otherwise well known to him), whither he intended to

U||   In a just way it is lawful to deceive the unjust enemy, but not to lie;
U||   that is, by stratagems and semblances of motions, by amusements and
U||   intrigues of actions, by ambushes and wit, by simulation and
U||   dissimulation.—Bishop Taylor, Ductor Dubitantium, b. iii. c. 2.
U||   [Pg 8]
U||   Anatomy. Now the act of dissection, but it was often used by our elder
U||   writers for the thing or object dissected, and then, as this was
U||   stripped of its flesh, for what we now call a skeleton. ‘Skeleton,’
U||   which see, had then another meaning.
U||   Here will be some need of assistants in this live, and to the quick,
U||   dissection, to deliver me from the violence of the anatomy.—Whitlock,
U||   Zootomia, p. 249.
U||   Antiquity held too light thoughts from objects of mortality, while some
U||   drew provocatives of mirth from anatomies, and jugglers showed tricks
U||   with skeletons.—Sir T. Browne, Hydriotaphia.

U||   A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
U||   A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
U||   A living deadman.
U||   Shakespeare, Comedy of Errors, act v. sc. 1.
U||   Animosity. While ‘animosus’ belongs to the best period of Latin
U||   literature, ‘animositas’ is of quite the later silver age. It was used
U||   in two senses; in that, first, of spiritedness or courage (‘equi
U||   animositas,’ the courage of a horse), and then, secondly, as this
U||   spiritedness in one particular direction, in that, namely, of a
U||   vigorous and active enmity or hatred (Heb. xi. 27, Vulg.) Of these two
U||   meanings the latter is the only one which our ‘animosity’ has retained;
U||   yet there was a time when it had the other as well.
U||   When her [the crocodile’s] young be newly hatched, such as give some
U||   proof of animosity, audacity, and execution, those she loveth, those
U||   she cherisheth.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 977.
U||   Doubtless such as are of a high-flown animosity affect fortunas
U||   laviniosas, as one calls it, a fortune that sits not strait and close
U||   to the body, but like a loose and a flowing garment.—Hacket, Life of
U||   Archbishop Williams, part i. p. 30.

U||   reading the Immortality of Plato, thereby confirming his wavering hand

U||   Annoy,     }
U||   Annoyance.
U||   Now rather to vex and disquiet than seriously to hurt and harm. But
U||   until comparatively a late day, it admitted no such mitigation of
U||   meaning. [The subst. annoy is the O. Fr. anoi (Mod. Fr. ennui), Sp.
U||   enojo, O. It. inodio, from Lat. in odio, lit. in hatred, used in the
U||   phrase in odio habui, I had in hatred, i.e. I was sick and tired of.]

U||   Apparent,   }
U||   Apparently.
U||   With the exception of the one phrase ‘heir apparent,’ meaning heir
U||   evident, manifest, undoubted, we do not any longer employ ‘apparent’
U||   for that which appears, because it is, but always either for that which
U||   appears and is not, or for that which appears, leaving in doubt whether
U||   it is or no.
U||   It is apparent foul play; and ’tis shame
U||   That greatness should so grossly offer it.
U||   Shakespeare, King John, act iv. sc. 2.
U||   At that time Cicero had vehement suspicions of Cæsar, but no apparent
U||   proof to convince him.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 718.
U||   The laws of God cannot without breach of Christian liberty, and the

U||   59.
U||   Love was not in their looks, either to God

U||   doth most apparently testify, the dead shall be restored to their own
U||   bodies, flesh and bones.—Articles of the Church (1552).
U||   Apprehensive. As there is nothing which persons lay hold of more
U||   readily than that aspect of a subject in which it presents matter for
U||   fear, ‘to apprehend’ has acquired the sense of to regard with fear;[Pg
U||   11] yet not so as that this use has excluded its earlier; but it has
U||   done so in respect of ‘apprehensive,’ which has now no other meaning
U||   than that of fearful, a meaning once quite foreign to it.
U||   See their odds in death:
U||   Appius died like a Roman gentleman,
U||   And a man both ways knowing; but this slave

U||   She, being an handsome, witty, and bold maid, was both apprehensive of
U||   the plot, and very active to prosecute it.—Fuller, The Profane State,

U||   Your worth and virtue; and as I did grow
U||   More and more apprehensive, I did thirst
U||   To see the man so praised.
U||   Beaumont and Fletcher, Philaster, act v. sc. 1.
U||   Ark. The ark of Noah, and ark of the covenant, were not the only ‘arks’
U||   of which our ancestors spoke. Indeed, in Lancashire at this day a press
U||   to keep clothes in is an ‘ark,’ a large bin for holding meal a
U||   ‘meal-ark.’
U||   Then first of all came forth Sir Satyrane,
U||   Bearing that precious relicke in an arke
U||   Of gold.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, iv. 4, 15.

U||   With wicker arks did come,
U||   To kiss and bear away
U||   The richer cowslips home.
U||   Herrick, Hesperides.
U||   Artificial, [Pg 12] }
U||   Artificially.
U||   That was ‘artificial’ once which wrought, or which was wrought,
U||   according to the true principles of art. The word has descended into
U||   quite a lower sphere of meaning; such, indeed, as the quotation from
U||   Bacon shows, it could occupy formerly, though not then exactly the same
U||   which it occupies now.
U||   Queen Elizabeth’s verses, some extant in the elegant, witty, and
U||   artificial book of The Art of English Poetry, are princely as her
U||   prose.—Bolton, Hypercritica.
U||   We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,[275]2
U||   Have with our neelds created both one flower.
U||   Shakespeare, Midsummer Night’s Dream, act iii. sc. 2.
U||   This is a demonstration that we are not in the right way, that we do
U||   not enquire wisely, that our method is not artificial. If men did fall
U||   upon the right way, it were impossible that so many learned men should
U||   be engaged in contrary parties and opinions.—Bishop Taylor, A Sermon
U||   preached before the University of Dublin.
U||   This he did the rather, because having at his coming out of Britain
U||   given artificially, for serving his own turn, some hopes in case he
U||   obtained the kingdom, to marry Anne, inheritress to the duchy of
U||   Britany.—Bacon, History of Henry VII.
U||   Artillery. Leaving the perplexed question of the derivation of this
U||   word,[276]3 it will be sufficient to observe, that while it is now only
U||   applied to the heavy ordnance of modern warfare, in earlier use any
U||   engines[Pg 13] for the projecting of missiles, even to the bow and
U||   arrows, would have been included under this term.
U||   The Parthians, having all their hope in artillery, overcame the Romans
U||   ofter than the Romans them.—Ascham, Toxophilus, p. 106 (ed. 1761).
U||   So the Philistines, the better to keep the Jews thrall and in
U||   subjection, utterly bereaved them of all manner of weapon and
U||   artillery, and left them naked.—Jewel, Reply to Mr. Harding, article
U||   xv.
U||   The Gods forbid, quoth he, one shaft of thine
U||   Should be discharged ’gainst that discourteous knight;
U||   His heart unworthy is, shootress divine,
U||   Of thine artillery to feel the might.
U||   Fairfax, Tasso, b. 17, s. 49.
U||   And Jonathan gave his artillery (weapons, R.V.) unto his lad, and said
U||   unto him, Go, carry them to the city.—1 Sam. xx. 40. (A.V.)
U||   Artisan, }
U||   Artist,
U||   Artful.
U||   ‘Artisan’ is no longer either in English or in French used of him who
U||   cultivates one of the fine arts, but only those of common life. The
U||   fine arts, losing this word, have now claimed ‘artist’ for their
U||   exclusive property; which yet was far from belonging to them always. An
U||   ‘artist’ in its earlier acceptation was one who cultivated, not the
U||   fine, but the liberal arts. The classical scholar was eminently the
U||   ‘artist.’ ‘Artful’ did not any more than ‘cunning,’ which see, imply
U||   art which had degenerated into artifice or trick.
U||   He was mightily abashed, and like an honest-minded man yielded the
U||   victory unto his adversary, saying withal, Zeuxis hath beguiled poor
U||   birds, but Parrhasius hath deceived Zeuxis, a professed
U||   artisan.—Holland, Pliny, vol. ii. p. 535.
U||   [Pg 14]
U||   Rare artisan, whose pencil moves
U||   Not our delights alone, but loves!

U||   For then the bold and coward,
U||   The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
U||   The hard and soft, seem all affined and kin.
U||   Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, act i. sc. 3.
U||   Nor would I dissuade any artist well grounded in Aristotle from
U||   perusing the most learned works any Romanist hath written in this
U||   argument. In other controversies between them and us it is dangerous, I
U||   must confess, even for well-grounded artists to begin with their
U||   writings, not so in this.—Jackson, Blasphemous Positions of Jesuits,
U||   Preface.
U||   Some will make me the pattern of ignorance for making this Scaliger
U||   [Julius] the pattern of the general artist, whose own son Joseph might
U||   have been his father in many arts.—Fuller, Holy State, b. ii. c. 8.
U||   Stupendous pile! not reared by mortal hands;
U||   Whate’er proud Rome or artful Greece beheld,
U||   Or elder Babylon its fame excelled.
U||   Pope, Temple of Fame.
U||   Ascertain. Now to acquire a certain knowledge of a thing, but once to
U||   render the thing itself certain. Thus, when Swift wrote a pamphlet
U||   having this title, ‘A Proposal for correcting, improving, and
U||   ascertaining the English Tongue,’ he did not propose to obtain a
U||   subjective certainty of what the English language was, but to give to
U||   the language itself an objective certainty and fixedness.
U||   Sometimes an evil or an obnoxious person hath so secured and
U||   ascertained a mischief to himself, that he that stays in his company or
U||   his traffic must also share in his punishment.—Bishop Taylor, The
U||   Return of Prayers.
U||   Success is intended him [the wicked man] only as a curse, as the very
U||   greatest of curses, and the readiest way, by[Pg 15] hardening him in
U||   his sin, to ascertain his destruction.—South, Sermons, vol. v. p. 286.
U||   Aspersion. Now only used figuratively, and in an evil sense; being that
U||   which one sprinkles on another to spot, stain, or hurt him: but subject
U||   to none of these limitations of old.
U||   The book of Job, and many places of the prophets, have great aspersion
U||   of natural philosophy.—Bacon, Fiium Labyrinthi.
U||   No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
U||   To make this contract grow.
U||   Shakespeare, Tempest, act iv. sc. 1.
U||   Assassin,    }
U||   Assassinate.
U||   It is difficult to say at what date the name of ‘assassin,’ given first
U||   to the emissaries of the ‘Old Man of the Mountain,’ who were sent forth
U||   on his errands of blood, and who bore this name because maddened with
U||   ‘haschisch,’ a drink drawn from hemp, was transferred to other secret
U||   slayers. The word does not occur in Shakespeare (‘assassination’ once),
U||   and only once in Milton’s verse. Neither is it found in our English
U||   Bible; although it may be a question whether ‘assassins’ would not be
U||   an apter, as it would certainly be a closer, rendering of σικάριοι, on
U||   the one occasion of this word’s appearing (Acts xxi. 38), than the
U||   ‘murderers’ which we have actually adopted.[277]4 The verb ‘to
U||   assassinate,’ as used by Milton, obtained a meaning which still
U||   survives in the French ‘assassiner’ and the Italian ‘assassinare,’ and
U||   signifies, as these often do, treacherously to assault, extremely to
U||   maltreat, without suggesting the actual taking away of[Pg 16] life,
U||   which ‘to assassinate’ now always implies for us. Doubtless it was the
U||   Italian use of the word which influenced him.
U||   These assassins were a precise sect of Mahometans, and had in them the
U||   very spirits of that poisonous superstition.—Fuller, Holy War, b. ii.
U||   c. 34.
U||   As for the custom that some parents and guardians have of forcing
U||   marriages, it will be better to say nothing of such a savage
U||   inhumanity, but only thus, that the law which gives not all freedom of
U||   divorce to any creature endued with reason, so assassinated, is next in
U||   cruelty.—Milton, The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, b. i. c. 12.
U||   Such usage as your honourable lords
U||   Afford me, assassinated and betrayed.
U||   Milton, Samson Agonistes, 1108.
U||   Assure,    }
U||   Assurance.
U||   Used often in our elder writers in the sense of ‘to betroth,’ or ‘to
U||   affiance.’ See ‘Ensure,’ ‘Sure.’
U||   King Philip. Young princes, close your hands.
U||   Austria. And your lips too; for I am well assured
U||   That I did so, when I was first assured.
U||   Shakespeare, King John, act ii. sc. 2.
U||   I myself have seen Lollia Paulina, only when she was to go unto a
U||   wedding supper, or rather to a feast when the assurance was made, so
U||   beset and bedeckt all over with emeralds and pearls.—Holland, Pliny,
U||   vol. i. p. 256.
U||   But though few days were before the day of assurance appointed, yet
U||   Love, that saw he had a great journey to make in a short time, hasted
U||   so himself, that before her word could tie her to Demagoras, her heart
U||   hath vowed her to Argalus.—Sir Philip Sidney, Arcadia, p. 17.
U||   Astonish. ‘To astonish’ has now loosened itself altogether from its
U||   etymology. The man ‘astonished’ can now be hardly said to be
U||   ‘thunderstruck,’ either in a literal or a figurative sense. But
U||   continually in[Pg 17] our early literature we shall quite fall below
U||   the writer’s intention unless we read this meaning into the word.[278]5
U||   Stone-still, astonished with this deadly deed,

U||   The knaves that lay in wait behind rose up and rolled down two huge
U||   stones, whereof the one smote the king upon the head, the other
U||   astonished his shoulder.—Holland, Livy, p. 1124.
U||   The cramp-fish [the torpedo] knoweth her own force and power, and being
U||   herself not benumbed, is able to astonish others.—Id. Pliny, vol. i. p.
U||   261.
U||   In matters of religion, blind, astonished, and struck with superstition
U||   as with a planet; in one word, monks.—Milton, History of England, b.
U||   ii.
U||   Astrology, }
U||   Astrologer.
U||   As ‘chemist’ only little by little disengaged itself from ‘alchemist,’
U||   and that, whether we have respect to the thing itself, or the name of
U||   the thing, so ‘astronomer’ from ‘astrologer,’ ‘astronomy’ from
U||   ‘astrology.’ It was long before the broad distinction between the lying
U||   art and the true science was recognized and fixed in words.
U||   If any enchantress should come unto her, and make promise to draw down
U||   the moon from heaven, she would mock these women and laugh at their
U||   gross ignorance, who suffer themselves to be persuaded for to believe
U||   the same, as having learned somewhat in astrology.—Holland, Plutarch’s
U||   Morals, p. 324.
U||   The astrologer is he that knoweth the course and motion of the heavens,
U||   and teacheth the same; which is a virtue[Pg 18] if it pass not his
U||   bounds, and become of an astrologer an astronomer, who taketh upon him
U||   to give judgment and censure of these motions and courses of the
U||   heavens, what they prognosticate and destiny unto the creature.—Hooper,
U||   Early Writings, Parker Society’s Edition, p. 731.
U||   Astronomy,  }
U||   Astronomer.
U||   See ‘Astrology.’
U||   Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
U||   And yet, methinks, I have astronomy,
U||   But not to tell of good or evil luck,
U||   Of plagues, of dearths, of seasons’ quality.
U||   Shakespeare, Sonnets, 14.
U||   Bowe ye not to astronomyers, neither axe ye onything of fals
U||   dyvynours.—Levit. xix. 31. Wiclif.
U||   If astronomers say true, every man at his birth by his constellation
U||   hath divers things and desires appointed him.—Pilkington, Exposition
U||   upon the Prophet Aggeus, c. i.
U||   Atone,     }
U||   Atonement.
U||   The notion of satisfaction lies now in these words rather than that of
U||   reconciliation. An ‘atonement’ is the satisfaction of a wrong which one
U||   party has committed against another, not the reconciliation of two
U||   estranged parties. This last, however, was its earlier meaning; and is
U||   in harmony with its etymology; for which see the quotation from Bishop
U||   Hall.
U||   He and Aufidius can no more atone
U||   Than violentest contrarieties.
U||   Shakespeare, Coriolanus, act iv. sc. 6.
U||   His first essay succeeded so well, Moses would adventure on a second
U||   design, to atone two Israelites at variance.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of
U||   Palestine, vol. ii. p. 92.
U||   Having more regard to their old variance than their new atonement.—Sir
U||   T. More, History of King Richard III.

U||   If Sir John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you, I am of
U||   the Church, and will be glad to do my benevolence, to make atonements
U||   and compromises between you.—Shakespeare, Merry Wives of Windsor, act
U||   i. sc. 1.
U||   Attire. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries specially
U||   head-dress, head-gear. ‘Attired with stars’ in Milton’s beautiful lines
U||   On Time is not, clothed with stars, but, crowned with them; compare
U||   Rev. xii. 1: ‘upon her head a crown of twelve stars.’
U||   She tore her attire from her head, and rent her golden hair.—The Seven
U||   Champions, b. ii. c. 13.
U||   With the linen mitre shall he be attired.—Lev. xvi. 4. (A. V.)
U||   Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon
U||   their heads.—Ezek. xxiii. 15 (A. V.)
U||   The heralds call the Horns of a Stag or Buck his Attire.—Bradley, Fam.
U||   Dict. s. v.
U||   Attorney. Seldom used now except of the attorney at law; being one,
U||   according to Blackstone’s definition, ‘who is put in the place, stead,
U||   or turn of another to manage his matters of law;’ and even in this
U||   sense it is going out of honour, and giving way to ‘solicitor.’ But
U||   formerly any who in any cause acted in the room, behalf, or turn of
U||   another would be called his ‘attorney;’ thus Phillips (New World of
U||   Words) defines attorney, ‘one appointed by another man to do anything
U||   in his stead, or to take upon him the charge of his business in his
U||   absence;’ and in proof of what high use the word might have, I[Pg 20]
U||   need but refer to the quotation which immediately follows:
U||   Our everlasting and only High Bishop; our only attorney, our mediator,
U||   only peacemaker between God and men.—A Short Catechism, 1553.
U||   Attorneys are denied me,
U||   And therefore personally I lay my claim
U||   To my inheritance of free descent.
U||   Shakespeare, King Richard II. act ii. sc. 3.
U||   Tertullian seems to understand this baptism for the dead [1 Cor. xv.
U||   29] de vicario baptismate, of baptism by an attorney, by a proxy, which
U||   should be baptized for me when I am dead.—Donne, Sermons, 1640, p. 794.
U||   Authentic. A distinction drawn by Bishop Watson between ‘genuine’ and
U||   ‘authentic’ has been often quoted: ‘A genuine book is that which was
U||   written by the person whose name it bears as the author of it. An
U||   authentic book is that which relates matters of fact as they really
U||   happened.’ Of ‘authentic’ he has certainly not seized the true force,
U||   neither do the uses of it by good writers bear him out. The true
U||   opposite to αὐθεντικός in Greek is ἀδέσποτος, and ‘authentic’ is
U||   properly original, independent, and thus coming with authority,
U||   authoritative.[279]6 Thus, an ‘authentic’ document is, in its first
U||   meaning, a document written by the proper hand of him from whom it
U||   professes to proceed. In all the passages which follow it will be
U||   observed that the word might be exchanged for ‘authoritative.’
U||   [Pg 21]
U||   As doubted tenures, which long pleadings try,
U||   Authentic grow by being much withstood.
U||   Davenant, Gondibert, b. ii.
U||   Should men be admitted to read Galen or Hippocrates, and yet the
U||   monopoly of medicines permitted to some one empiric or apothecary, not
U||   liable to any account, there might be a greater danger of poisoning
U||   than if these grand physicians had never written; for that might be
U||   prescribed them by such an authentic mountebank as a cordial, which the
U||   other had detected for poison.—Jackson, The Eternal Truth of
U||   Scriptures, b. ii. c. 23.

U||   Awfulness.
U||   This used once to be often employed of that which felt awe; it is only

U||   [Pg 22]
U||   Awkward. In its present signification, unhandy, ungainly, maladroit;
U||   but formerly[280]7 untoward, and that, whether morally or physically,
U||   perverse, contrary, sinister, unlucky.
U||   With awkward wind and with sore tempest driven
U||   To fall on shore.
U||   Marlowe, Edward II. act iv. sc. 7.
U||   The beast long struggled, as being like to prove
U||   An awkward sacrifice,[281]8 but by the horns
U||   The quick priest pulled him on his knees and slew him.
U||   Marlowe, The First Book of Lucan.
U||   Was I for this nigh wrecked upon the sea,
U||   And twice by awkward wind from England’s bank
U||   Drove back again unto my native clime?
U||   Shakespeare, 1 Henry VI. act iii. sc. 2.
U||   But time hath rooted out my parentage,
U||   And to the world and awkward casualties
U||   Bound me in servitude.
U||   Id., Pericles, Prince of Tyre, act v. sc. 1.
U||   Babe, }
U||   Baby.
U||   ‘Doll’ is of late introduction into the English language, is certainly
U||   later than Dryden. ‘Babe,’ ‘baby,’ or puppet supplied its place.
U||   True religion standeth not in making, setting up, painting, gilding,
U||   clothing, and decking of dumb and dead images, which be but great
U||   puppets and babies for old fools, in dotage and wicked idolatry, to
U||   dally and play with.—Homilies; Against Peril of Idolatry.
U||   Babes of clouts are good enough to keep children from crying.—Fuller,
U||   Holy War, b. iv. c. 17.
U||   [Pg 23]
U||   But all as a poore pedler he did wend,
U||   Bearing a trusse of tryfles at hys backe,
U||   As bells, and babes, and glasses in hys packe.
U||   Spenser, The Shepherd’s Calendar, May.
U||   Think you that the child hath any notion of the strong contents of
U||   riper age? or can he possibly imagine there are any such delights as
U||   those his babies and rattles afford him?—Allestree, Sermons, part ii.
U||   p. 148.
U||   Bacchanal. Used now generally of a drunken reveller or votary of
U||   Bacchus; but it was once more accurately applied to the ‘bacchanalia,’
U||   or orgies celebrated in his honour.
U||   Do not ye, like those heathen in their bacchanals, inflame yourselves
U||   with wine.—Hammond, Paraphrase on the N. T., Ephes. v. 18.
U||   So bacchanals of drunken riot were kept too much in London and
U||   Westminster, which offended many, that the thanks due only to God
U||   should be paid to the devil.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part
U||   i. p. 165.
U||   Well, I could wish that still in lordly domes
U||   Some beasts were killed, though not whole hecatombs;
U||   That both extremes were banished from their walls,
U||   Carthusian fasts, and fulsome bacchanals.
U||   Pope, Satires of Dr. Donne.
U||   Baffle. Now to counterwork and to defeat; but once not this so much as
U||   to mock and put to shame, and, in the technical language of chivalry,
U||   it expressed a ceremony of open scorn with which a recreant or perjured
U||   knight was visited. [See quotation from Hall, Chron. in N.E.D.]
U||   First he his beard did shave and foully shent,
U||   Then from him reft his shield, and it renverst,
U||   And blotted out his armes with falshood blent,
U||   And himselfe baffuld, and his armes unherst,
U||   And broke his sword in twaine, and all his armour sperst.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, v. 3, 37.
U||   [Pg 24]
U||   He that suffers himself to be ridden, or through pusillanimity or
U||   sottishness will let every man baffle him, shall be a common
U||   laughing-stock to flout at.—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy, part ii. §
U||   3.
U||   Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
U||   Shakespeare, Twelfth Night, act v. sc. 1.
U||   Banquet. At present the entire course of any solemn or sumptuous
U||   entertainment; but ‘banquet’ (O. Fr. banquet, cp. It. ‘banchetto,’ a
U||   small bench or table) used generally to be restrained to a slighter
U||   repast, to the lighter and ornamental dessert or refection, or the
U||   ‘banquet of wine’ (Esth. vii. 2), which followed and crowned the more
U||   substantial repast.
U||   I durst not venture to sit at supper with you; should I have received
U||   you then, coming as you did with armed men to banquet with me?
U||   [Convivam me tibi committere ausus non sum; comissatorem te cum armatis
U||   venientem recipiam?]—Holland, Livy, p. 1066.
U||   Then was the banqueting-chamber in the tilt-yard at Greenwich furnished
U||   for the entertainment of these strangers, where they did both sup and
U||   banquet.—Cavendish, Life of Cardinal Wolsey.
U||   We’ll dine in the great room; but let the music
U||   And banquet be prepared here.
U||   Massinger, The Unnatural Combat, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   Base,     }
U||   Baseness.
U||   The aristocratic tendencies of speech (tendencies illustrated by the
U||   word ‘aristocracy’ itself), which reappear in a thousand shapes, on the
U||   one side in such words, and their usages, as καλοκἀγαθός, ἐπιεικής,
U||   ‘noble,’ on the other in such as ‘villain,’ ‘boor,’ ‘knave,’ ‘churl,’
U||   and in this ‘base,’ are well worthy of accurate observation. Thus
U||   ‘base’ always now implies moral unworthiness;[Pg 25] but did not so
U||   once. ‘Base’ men were no more than men of humble birth and low degree.
U||   But vertuous women wisely understand
U||   That they were borne to base humilitie,
U||   Unlesse the heavens them lift to lawful soveraintie.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, v. 5, 25.
U||   He that is ashamed of base and simple attire, will be proud of gorgeous
U||   apparel, if he may get it.—Homilies; Against Excess of Apparel.
U||   By this means we imitate the Lord Himself, who hath abased Himself to
U||   the lowest degree of baseness in this kind, emptying Himself (Phil. ii.
U||   8), that he might be equal to them of greatest baseness.—Rogers, Naaman
U||   the Syrian, p. 461.
U||   Battle. Used, not as now, of the hostile shock of armies; but often of
U||   the army itself; or sometimes in a more special sense, of the main body
U||   of the army, as distinguished from the van and rear.
U||   Each battle sees the other’s umbered face.
U||   Shakespeare, King Henry V. act iv. Chorus.
U||   Richard led the vanguard of English; Duke Odo commanded in the main
U||   battle over his French; James of Auvergne brought on the Flemings and
U||   Brabanters in the rear.—Fuller, Holy War, b. iii. c. 11.
U||   Where divine blessing leads up the van, and man’s valour brings up the
U||   battle, must not victory needs follow in the rear?—Id., A Pisgah Sight
U||   of Palestine, vol. i. p. 174.
U||   Bawd. Not confined once to one sex only, but could have been applied to
U||   pandar and pandaress alike.
U||   He was if I schal yive him his laude,
U||   A theef, a sompnour and eek a baude.
U||   Chaucer, The Freres Tale.
U||   [Pg 26]
U||   One Lamb, a notorious impostor, a fortune-teller, and an employed
U||   bawd.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part ii. p. 81.
U||   A carrion crow he [the flatterer] is, a gaping grave,
U||   The rich coat’s moth, the court’s bane, trencher’s slave,
U||   Sin’s and hell’s winning bawd, the devil’s factoring knave.
U||   P. Fletcher, The Purple Island, c. viii.
U||   Beastly,     }
U||   Beastliness.
U||   We translate σῶμα ψυχικόν (1 Cor. xv. 44) ‘a natural body;’ some have
U||   regretted that it was not rendered ‘an animal body;’ [so R.V. margin,
U||   Jude 19.] This is exactly what Wiclif meant when he translated the
U||   ‘corpus animale’ which he found in his Vulgate, ‘a beastly body.’ The
U||   word had then no ethical tinge; nor, when it first acquired such, had
U||   it exactly that which it now possesses; in it was rather implied the
U||   absence of reason, the prerogative distinguishing man from beast.
U||   It is sowun a beestli bodi; it schal rise a spiritual bodi.—1 Cor. xv.
U||   44. Wiclif.
U||   These ben, whiche departen hemsilf, beestli men, not havynge
U||   spirit.—Jude 19. Wiclif.
U||   Where they should have made head with the whole army upon the
U||   Parthians, they sent him aid by small companies; and when they were
U||   slain, they sent him others also. So that by their beastliness and lack
U||   of consideration they had like to have made all the army fly.—North,
U||   Plutarch’s Lives, p. 769.
U||   Bedlam. An old pronunciation of Bethlehem. The Priory known by this
U||   name was in 1546 converted into a hospital for lunatics. But it was not
U||   the place only, but the unhappy occupants of it, to whom this name used
U||   often to be applied. Such a use has now quite died out.
U||   [Pg 27]
U||   Ha, art thou bedlam? dost thou thirst, base Trojan,
U||   To have me fold up Parca’s fatal web?
U||   Shakespeare, Henry V. act v. sc. 1.
U||   Is not all for thy good, if thou be not a bedlam?
U||   Rogers, Naamam the Syrian, p. 30.
U||   Benefice,   }
U||   Beneficial.
U||   [In Middle English benefice often occurs in the senses of kindness,
U||   favour, benefit, a gift, gratuity.] Persons are not now ‘beneficial,’
U||   which word is reserved for things, but ‘beneficent.’
U||   The benefices that God did tham here
U||   Sal tham accuse on sere manere.
U||   Richard Rolle de Hampole, Pricke of Conscience, 5582.
U||   Nowe thanne, Lord, Thou art God, and hast spoke to thy servant so grete
U||   benefices.—1 Chron. xvii. 26. Wiclif.
U||   The proper nature of God is always to be helpful and
U||   beneficial.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 600.
U||   I wonder
U||   That such a keech can with his very bulk
U||   Take up the rays of the beneficial sun,
U||   And keep it from the earth.
U||   Shakespeare, Henry VIII. act i. sc. 1.
U||   Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name; then shall the
U||   righteous come about me when Thou art beneficial unto me.—Ps. cxlii. 7.
U||   Geneva.
U||   Blackguard. The scullions and other meaner retainers in a great
U||   household, who, when progress was made from one residence to another,
U||   accompanied and protected the pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils,
U||   riding among them and being smutted by them, were contemptuously styled
U||   the ‘black guard.’ It is easy to trace the subsequent history of the
U||   word. With a slight forgetfulness of its origin, he is now[Pg 28]
U||   called a ‘blackguard,’ who would have been once said to belong to the
U||   ‘black guard.’
U||   Close unto the front of the chariot marcheth all the sort of weavers
U||   and embroderers; next unto whom goeth the black guard and
U||   kitchenry.—Holland, Ammianus, p. 12.
U||   A lousy slave, that within this twenty years rode with the black guard
U||   in the Duke’s carriage, ’mongst spits and dripping-pans!—Webster, The
U||   White Devil.
U||   Thieves and murderers took upon them the cross to escape the gallows;
U||   adulterers did penance in their armour. A lamentable case that the
U||   devil’s black guard should be God’s soldiers!—Fuller, Holy War, b. i.
U||   c. 12.
U||   Where the apologist meets with this black guard, these factors for
U||   error and sin, these agitators for the Prince of darkness, God forbid
U||   he should give place to them, or not charge them home, and resist them
U||   to the face.—Gauden, Hieraspistes, To the Reader.
U||   Dukes, earls, and lords, great commanders in war, common soldiers and
U||   kitchen boys were glad to trudge it on foot in the mire hand in hand, a
U||   duke or earl not disdaining to support or help up one of the black
U||   guard ready to fall, lest he himself might fall into the mire, and have
U||   none to help him.—Jackson, A Treatise of the Divine Essence and
U||   Attributes, b. vi. c. 28.
U||   We have neither school nor hospital for the distressed children, called
U||   the black guard.—Nelson, Address to Persons of Quality, p. 214.
U||   Bleak. This, a northern form, the equivalent of O.E. blāc (cp. O.N.
U||   bleikr, Mod. German bleich, pale, colourless), comes out clearly in its
U||   original relationship with ‘bleach’ in the following quotations.
U||   When she came out, she looked as pale and as bleak as one that were
U||   laid out dead.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs; The Escape of Agnes Wardall.
U||   And as I looked forth, I beheld a pale horse, whom I took[Pg 29] for
U||   the universal synagogue of hypocrites, pale as men without health, and
U||   bleak as men without that fresh spirit of life which is in Christ
U||   Jesus.—Bale, The Image of Both Churches, P. S. p. 321.
U||   Blunderbuss. In the 17th and 18th centuries a man who blunders in his
U||   work, does it in a boisterous violent way; transferred from the name
U||   given to a short, wide-mouthed, noisy gun. [This word for a gun is due
U||   to the Dutch donderbus, i.e. thunder-gun, perverted in form from sense
U||   association with blunder, perhaps with allusion to its random, casual
U||   firing.]
U||   We could now wish we had a discreet and intelligent adversary, and not
U||   such a hare-brained blunderbuss as you, to deal with.—Milton, A Defence
U||   of the People of England, Preface.
U||   Jacob, the scourge of grammar, mark with awe,
U||   Nor less revere him, blunderbuss of law.
U||   Pope, Dunciad, b. iii. 150.
U||   Boistous,   }
U||   Boisterous.
U||   The sense of noisy, turbulent, blustering, is a later superaddition on
U||   ‘boisterous,’ or ‘boistous,’ as was its earlier form. Of old it meant
U||   no more than rude, rough, strong, uncompliant; thus the ‘boisterous
U||   wind’ of Matt. xiv. 30, is simply a violent wind, ἄνεμος ἰσχυρός in the
U||   original.
U||   No man putteth a clout of buystous clothe [panni rudis, Vulg.] into an
U||   elde clothing.—Matt. ix. 16. Wiclif.
U||   O Clifford, boisterous[282]9 Clifford, thou hast slain
U||   The flower of Europe for his chivalry.
U||   Shakespeare, 3 Henry VI. act ii. sc. 1.
U||   His boistrous body shines in burnished steel.
U||   Sylvester, Du Bartas’ Weeks, The Magnificence, p. 460.
U||   [Pg 30]
U||   The greatest danger indeed is from those that are stolide feroces, full
U||   of those boisterous, rude, and brutish passions, which grow as bristles
U||   upon hogs’ backs, from ignorance, pride, rusticity, and
U||   prejudice.—Gauden, Hieraspistes. To the Reader.
U||   The leathern outside, boisterous as it was,
U||   Gave way, and bent beneath her strict embrace.
U||   Dryden, Sigismunda and Guiscardo, 159, 160.
U||   The other thing in debate seemed very hard and boisterous to his
U||   Majesty, that sundry leaders in the House of Commons would provoke him
U||   to proclaim open war with Spain.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams,
U||   part i. p. 79.
U||   Bombast. Now inflated diction, words which, sounding lofty and big,
U||   have no real substance about them. This, which is now the sole meaning,
U||   was once only the secondary and the figurative, ‘bombast’ being
U||   literally the cotton wadding with which garments are stuffed out and
U||   lined, and often so used by our writers of the Elizabethan period, and
U||   then by a vigorous image transferred to what now it exclusively means.
U||   Certain I am there was never any kind of apparel ever invented, that
U||   could more disproportion the body of man than these doublets, stuffed
U||   with four, five, or six pound of bombast at the least.—Stubbes, Anatomy
U||   of Abuses, p. 23.
U||   We have received your letters full of love!
U||   Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
U||   And, in our maiden council, rated them
U||   At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,
U||   As bombast, and as lining to the time.
U||   Shakespeare, Love’s Labour’s Lost, act v. sc. 2.
U||   Bombast, the cotton-plant growing in Asia.—Phillips, New World of
U||   Words.
U||   Boot. Not the luggage, but the attendants, used once to ride in the
U||   ‘boot,’ or rather the boots, of a[Pg 31] carriage, for there were two.
U||   Projecting from the sides of the carriage and open to the air, they
U||   derived, no doubt, their name from their shape.
U||   His coach being come, he causeth him to be laid in softly, and so he in
U||   one boot, and the two chirurgeons in the other, they drive away to the
U||   very next country house.—Reynolds, God’s Revenge against Murder, b. i.
U||   hist.
U||   He [James the First] received his son into the coach, and found a
U||   slight errand to leave Buckingham behind, as he was putting his foot in
U||   the boot.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part i. p. 196.
U||   Bounty. The tendency to accept freedom of giving in lieu of all other
U||   virtues, or at least to regard it as the chiefest of all, the same
U||   which has brought ‘charity’ to be for many identical with almsgiving,
U||   displays itself in our present use of ‘bounty,’ which, like the French
U||   ‘bonté,’ meant goodness once.
U||   For God it woot that childer ofte been
U||   Unlik her worthy eldris hem bifore;
U||   Bounté cometh al of God, nought of the streen,
U||   Of which thay ben engendrid and i-bore.
U||   Chaucer, Clerkes Tale (Morris, p. 283).
U||   Nourishing meats and drinks in a sick body do lose their bounty, and
U||   augmenteth malady.—Sir T. Elyot, The Governor, b. ii. c. 7.
U||   Brat. This word is now used always in contempt, but was not so once.
U||   O Israel, O household of the Lord,
U||   O Abraham’s brats, O brood of blessed seed,
U||   O chosen sheep that loved the Lord indeed.
U||   Gascoigne, De Profundis.
U||   Take heed how thou layest the bane for the rats,
U||   For poisoning thy servant, thyself, and thy brats.
U||   Tusser, Points of Good Husbandry.
U||   Brave, [Pg 32] }
U||   Bravery.
U||   The ultimate derivation of ‘brave’ is altogether uncertain (see
U||   N.E.D.); we obtained it in the fifteenth century, the Germans in the
U||   seventeenth, (Grimm [s. v. ‘brav’] says during the Thirty Years’ War,)
U||   from one or other of the Romance languages, probably from the It.
U||   bravo. I do not very clearly trace by what steps it obtained the
U||   meaning of showy, gaudy, rich, which once it so frequently had, in
U||   addition to that meaning which it still retains.
U||   The habit also and attire of his body, manly and soldier-like, not
U||   brave nor tricked up daintily and delicately, much adorned and set him
U||   out.—Plutarch, Lives, 695.
U||   His clothes [St. Augustine’s] were neither brave, nor base, but
U||   comely.—Fuller, Holy State, b. iv. c. 10.
U||   If he [the good yeoman] chance to appear in clothes above his rank, it
U||   is to grace some great man with his service, and then he blusheth at
U||   his own bravery.—Id. ib. b. ii. c. 18.
U||   Traffic encreaseth wonderfully here, with all kind of bravery and
U||   building.—Howell, Letters, i. 6, 36.
U||   Man is a noble animal, splendid in ashes, and pompous in the grave,
U||   solemnizing nativities and deaths with equal lustre, not omitting
U||   ceremonies of bravery in the infamy of his nature.—Sir T. Browne,
U||   Hydriotaphia.
U||   There is a great festival now drawing on, a festival designed chiefly
U||   for the acts of a joyful piety, but generally made only an occasion of
U||   bravery.—South, Sermons, vol. ii. p. 285.
U||   Bribe,   }
U||   Bribery.
U||   ‘To bribe’ was to rob, a ‘bribour’ a robber, and ‘bribery’ robbery,
U||   once. For an ingenious history of the steps by which the words left
U||   their former meaning, and acquired their present, see Marsh, Lectures
U||   on the English Language, 1st Series, p. 249.
U||   [Pg 33]
U||   They that delight in superfluity of gorgeous apparel and dainty fare,
U||   commonly do deceive the needy, bribe, and pill from them.—Cranmer,
U||   Instruction of Prayer.
U||   Woe be to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites, for ye make clean the
U||   utter side of the cup and of the platter; but within they are full of
U||   bribery [ἁρπαγῆς, and in the E. V. ‘extortion’] and excess.—Matt.
U||   xxiii. 25. Geneva Version.
U||   Britain, }
U||   Britany.
U||   The distinction between these is perfectly established now: by the
U||   first we always intend Great Britain; by the second, the French duchy,
U||   corresponding to the ancient Armorica. But it was long before this
U||   usage was accurately settled and accepted by all. By ‘Britany’ Great
U||   Britain was frequently intended, and vice versâ. Thus, in each of the
U||   passages which follow, the other word than that which actually is used
U||   would be now employed.
U||   He [Henry VII.] was not so averse from a war, but that he was resolved
U||   to choose it, rather than to have Britain carried by France, being so
U||   great and opulent a duchy, and situate so opportunely to annoy England,
U||   either for coast or trade.—Bacon, History of King Henry VII.
U||   The letter of Quintus Cicero, which he wrote in answer to that of his
U||   brother Marcus, desiring of him an account of Britany.—Sir T. Browne,
U||   Musæum Clausum.
U||   And is it this, alas! which we
U||   (O irony of words!) do call Great Britany?
U||   Cowley, The Extasy.
U||   Brook. This, the O.E. brūcan (cp. German brauchen), has now obtained a
U||   special limitation, meaning not so much, as once it did, to use, as to
U||   endure to use.
U||   But none of all those curses overtooke
U||   The warlike Maide, th’ ensample of that might;
U||   [Pg 34]
U||   But fairely well she thryvd, and well did brooke
U||   Her noble deeds, ne her right course for ought forsooke.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, iii. 4, 44.
U||   Forasmuch as many brooked divers and many laudable ceremonies and rites
U||   heretofore used and accustomed in the Church of England, not yet
U||   abrogated by the king’s authority, his Majesty charged and commanded
U||   all his subjects to observe and keep them.—Strype, Memorials of
U||   Archbishop Cranmer, vol. i. p. 412.
U||   And, as a German writer well observes, the French kings might well
U||   brook that title of Christianissimi from that admirable exploit of
U||   Carolus Martellus, the next means under God’s providence that other
U||   parts of Europe had not Saracen tyrants instead of Christian
U||   princes.—Jackson, The Eternal Truth of Scriptures, b. i. c. 26.

U||   [Bullion. This word is now generally used in the sense of metal,
U||   specially precious metal in the mass: ‘gold or silver in the lump, as
U||   distinguished from coin or manufactured articles, also applied to
U||   coined or manufactured gold or silver when considered simply with
U||   reference to its value as raw material,’ N.E.D. The word was once
U||   frequently used of gold or silver below the standard purity. Bullion
U||   has no connexion etymologically either with Fr. billon or with Lat.
U||   bulla; it appears to be identical with Fr. bouillon, Late Lat.
U||   bullionem, a boiling, hence, a melting, a melted mass of metal. The Fr.
U||   billon, debased metal, meant originally mass, having the same stem as
U||   billet (of wood). No doubt the word billon has influenced the sense of
U||   the English bullion.]

U||   flourdelis.—Caxton, Legenda Aurea, 151. 2.
U||   Butchery. Now a massacre where there is little or no resistance on the
U||   part of those who are its victims. It was used once as the place where
U||   animals were slaughtered. [But see N.E.D. for modern quotations of the
U||   word in this latter sense.]
U||   [Pg 36]
U||   Al thing that is seld in the bocherie ete ye, axynge nothing for

U||   Whence came it that they call the shambles or butcherie at Rome where
U||   flesh is to be sold, macellum?—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 869.
U||   Buxom. The modern spelling of ‘buxom’ (it was somewhat, though not much
U||   better, when it was spelt ‘bucksome’) has quite hidden its identity
U||   with the German ‘biegsam,’ ‘beugsam,’ bendable, pliable, and so
U||   obedient. Ignorant of the history of the word, and trusting to the
U||   feeling and impression which it conveyed to their minds, men spoke of
U||   ‘buxom health’ and the like, meaning by this, having a cheerful
U||   comeliness. The epithet in this application is Gray’s, and Johnson
U||   justly finds fault with it. [See N.E.D. for the two quotations.]
U||   Milton, when he joins ‘buxom’ with ‘blithe and debonair,’ and Crashaw,
U||   in his otherwise beautiful line,
U||   ‘I am born
U||   Again a fresh child of the buxom morn,’
U||   show that already for them the true meaning of the word, common enough
U||   in our earlier writers, was passing away; yet Milton still uses it in
U||   its proper sense in Paradise Lost,—‘winnowing the buxom air,’ that is,
U||   the yielding air.
U||   I submit myself unto this holy Church of Christ, to be ever buxom and
U||   obedient to the ordinance of it, after my knowledge and power, by the
U||   help of God.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs; Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   Buxom, kind, tractable, and pliable one to the other.—Holland,

U||   [Pg 37]
U||   By. The first clause in the quotation which follows from the Authorized
U||   Version of the Bible must often either fail to convey any meaning, or
U||   must convey a wrong meaning, to the English reader of the present day.
U||   The ‘nil conscire sibi’ is what the Apostle would claim for himself;
U||   and the other passages quoted show that this idiomatic use of ‘by,’ as
U||   equivalent to ‘concerning’ (it is probably related to ἀμφὶ), but with
U||   also a suggestion of ‘against,’ was not peculiar to our Translators.
U||   I think S. Paul spake these words [‘who mind earthly things’] by the
U||   clergymen that will take upon them the spiritual office of preaching,
U||   and yet meddle in worldly matters too, contrary to their
U||   calling.—Latimer, Sermons, p. 529.

U||   Archbishop Cranmer, b. i. c. 8.

U||   God is said to be greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things. He
U||   knows more by us than we by ourselves.—Gurnall, The Christian in
U||   Complete Armour, iii. 2, 8.
U||   By and by. Now a future more or less remote; but when our Version of
U||   the Bible was made, the[Pg 38] nearest possible future. The inveterate
U||   procrastination of men has put ‘by and by’ farther and farther off.
U||   Already in Barrow’s time it had acquired its present meaning.
U||   And some counselled the archbishop to burn me by and by, and some other
U||   counselled him to drown me in the sea, for it is near hand there.—Foxe,
U||   Book of Martyrs; Examination of William Thorpe.

U||   When Demophantus fell to the ground, his soldiers fled by and by [εὐθὺς
U||   ἔφυγον] upon it.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 308.
U||   [Caitiff. According to present usage the word expresses contempt, often
U||   involving strong moral disapprobation. It means a base, mean,
U||   despicable wretch, a contemptible villain. In the sixteenth and
U||   seventeenth centuries the word has often a tinge of pity, meaning a
U||   wretched, miserable person. Originally caitiff meant a captive, a
U||   prisoner, being in fact the same word as captive, the latter being
U||   derived directly from the Latin captivus, while caitiff is its
U||   Anglo-Norman form caitif, used in the sense of captive, weak,
U||   miserable; cp. It. cattivo, captive, lewd, bad, and Mod. Fr. chétif, of
U||   little value, wretched, miserable.]

U||   Alas, poore Caitiffe.
U||   Shakespeare, Othello, act iv. sc. 1.
U||   Capitulate. There is no reason why the reducing of any agreement to
U||   certain heads or ‘capitula’ should not be called to ‘capitulate,’ the
U||   victor thus ‘capitulating’ as well as the vanquished; and the present
U||   limitation of the word’s use, by which it means to surrender on certain
U||   specified terms, is quite of modern introduction.
U||   Gelon the tyrant, after he had defeated the Carthaginians near to the
U||   city Himera, when he made peace with them, capitulated, among other
U||   articles of treaty, that they should no more sacrifice any infants to
U||   Saturn.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 405.
U||   He [the Emperor Charles V.] makes a voyage into England, and there
U||   capitulates with the King, among other things, to take to wife his

U||   article with his own creature, with whom He may do what He will!—Howe,

U||   Captivate. This is not used any longer in a literal, but always in a
U||   more or less allegorical sense.

U||   Carp. The Promptorium gives ‘fabulor,’ ‘confabulor,’ ‘garrulo’ as Latin

U||   subaudition of fault-finding or detraction, which now is ever implied
U||   in the word.

U||   Carpet. The covering of floors only at present, but once of tables as
U||   well. It was in this sense that a matter was ‘on the carpet’ (i.e. of
U||   the council-table). For the etymology see N.E.D.
U||   In the fray one of their spurs engaged into a carpet upon which stood a
U||   very fair looking-glass and two noble pieces of porcelain, drew all to
U||   the ground, broke the glass.—Harleian Miscellany, vol. x. p. 189.
U||   Private men’s halls were hung with altar-cloths; their tables and beds
U||   covered with copes, instead of carpets and coverlets.—Fuller, Church
U||   History of Britain, b. vii. § 2, 1.
U||   And might not these [copes] be handsomely converted into private uses,
U||   to serve as carpets for their tables, coverlids to their beds, or
U||   cushions to their chairs or windows?—Heylin, History of the
U||   Reformation, To the Reader.
U||   Carriage. Now, that which carries, or the act of carrying; but once,
U||   that which was carried, and thus baggage. From ignorance of this, the
U||   Authorized Translation, at Acts xxi. 15, has been often found fault
U||   with, but unjustly.
U||   Spartacus charged his [Lentulus’] lieutenants that led the army, gave
U||   them battle, overthrew them, and took all their carriage [τὴν ἀποσκευὴν
U||   ἅπασαν, LXX.].—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 470.
U||   And David left his carriage [τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, LXX.] in the hand of the
U||   keeper of the carriage.—1 Sam. xvii. 22 (A.V.)
U||   An index is a necessary implement, and no impediment of a book, except
U||   in the same sense in which the carriages of an army are termed
U||   impedimenta.—Fuller, Worthies of England: Norfolk.
U||   [Cattle. This and ‘chattel’ are only different forms of the same word.
U||   In Middle English as in Old French the forms catel and chatel are
U||   dialectal variants of the same Late Latin original capitale, the[Pg 42]
U||   word in all its forms meaning simply capital, principal, property,
U||   substance, wealth. In the time of Chaucer and Wiclif catel was still
U||   used in the sense of wealth, substance generally, whereas now its
U||   equivalent cattle is only used to express property in living animals,
U||   the form chattel being reserved for non-living personal property. It
U||   may be here noted that we have in the word fee another interesting
U||   instance of the intimate connexion between the ideas of property
U||   generally and of cattle (live stock). The word fee means now a reward
U||   or payment in money, in Middle English it meant property in general,
U||   including money and live stock; the Old English feoh, the phonetic
U||   equivalent of the Latin pecus, meant originally cattle, live stock; see
U||   Kluge, s.v. vieh.]

U||   The avarous man hath more hope in his catel than in Jhesu
U||   Crist.—Chaucer, The Persones Tale (Morris, p. 330).
U||   Censure. It speaks ill for the charity of men’s judgments, that
U||   ‘censure,’ which designated once favourable and unfavourable judgments
U||   alike, is now restricted to unfavourable; for it must be that the
U||   latter, being by far the most frequent, have in this way appropriated
U||   the word exclusively to themselves.
U||   Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.
U||   Shakespeare, Hamlet, act i. sc. 3.
U||   His [Richard, Earl of Cornwall’s] voyage was variously censured; the
U||   Templars, who consented not to the peace,[Pg 43] flouted thereat, as if
U||   all this while he had laboured about a difficult nothing; others
U||   thought he had abundantly satisfied any rational expectation.—Fuller,
U||   Holy War, b. iv. c. 8.
U||   Which could not be past over without this censure; for it is an ill
U||   thrift to be parsimonious in the praise of that which is very
U||   good.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part ii. p. 13.
U||   Chaffer. Once, simply to buy, to make a bargain, now to higgle or
U||   dispute about the making of a bargain.

U||   Where is the fayre flocke thou was wont to leade?
U||   Or bene they chaffred, or at mischiefe dead?
U||   Spenser, Shepherd’s Calendar, September.
U||   Chaos. The earliest meaning of χάος in Greek, of ‘chaos’ in Latin, was
U||   empty infinite space, the yawning kingdom of darkness; only a
U||   secondary, that which we have now adopted, namely, the rude, confused,
U||   indigested, unorganized matter out of which the universe according to
U||   the heathen cosmogony was formed. But the primary use of ‘chaos’ was
U||   not strange to the scholars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
U||   Beside all these things, between us and you there is fixed a great
U||   chaos, that they which will pass from hence to you may not.—Luke xvi.
U||   26. Rheims.
U||   And look what other thing soever besides cometh within the chaos of
U||   this monster’s mouth, be it beast, boat, or stone, down it goeth
U||   incontinently that foul great swallow of his.—Holland, Plutarch’s
U||   Morals, p. 975.
U||   [Pg 44]
U||   To the brow of heaven
U||   Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss
U||   Into their place of punishment, the gulf
U||   Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
U||   His fiery chaos to receive their fall.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, vi. 51.
U||   Cheat,   }
U||   Cheater.
U||   The steps by which ‘escheat’ has yielded ‘cheat,’ and ‘escheatour’
U||   ‘cheater,’ are interesting to trace. The ‘escheatour’ was an officer in
U||   each county who took notice of fines and forfeitures technically called
U||   ‘escheats’ on the royal manors, which had fallen in to the Crown, and
U||   certified these to the Exchequer. But he had commonly such a reputation
U||   for fraud and extortion in the execution of his office, that by an only
U||   too natural transition the ‘escheatour’ passed into the ‘cheater,’ and
U||   ‘escheat’ into ‘cheat.’ The quotation from Gurnall is curious as
U||   marking the word in the very act of this transition.
U||   And yet the taking off these vessels was not the best and goodliest
U||   cheat of their victory; but this passed all, that with one light
U||   skirmish they became lords of all the sea along those coasts.—Holland,
U||   Livy, p. 444.
U||   This man who otherwise beforetime was but poor and needy, by these
U||   windfalls and unexpected cheats became very wealthy.—Id. Plutarch’s
U||   Morals, p. 1237.
U||   Falstaff. Here’s another letter to her. She bears the purse too; she is
U||   a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to them
U||   both, and they shall be exchequers to me.—Shakespeare, Merry Wives of
U||   Windsor, act i. sc. 2.
U||   By this impudence they may abuse credulous souls into a belief of what
U||   they say, as a cheater may pick the purses of innocent people, by
U||   showing them something like the King’s broad seal, which was indeed his
U||   own forgery.—Gurnall, The Christian in Complete Armour, 1639, vol. ii.
U||   p. 201.
U||   [Pg 45]
U||   Cheer. Cicero, who loves to bring out superiorities, where he can find
U||   them, of the Latin language over the Greek, urges this as one, that the
U||   Greek has no equivalent to the Latin ‘vultus’ (Leg. i. 9, 27); the
U||   countenance, that is, ethically regarded, as the ever-varying index and
U||   exponent of the sentiments and emotions of the soul (‘imago animi
U||   vultus est,’ De Orat. iii. 59, 221). Perhaps it may be charged on the
U||   English, that it too is now without such a word. But ‘cheer,’ in its
U||   earlier uses, of which vestiges still survive, was exactly such.
U||   In swoot of thi cheer thou schalt ete thi breed, till thou turne ayen
U||   in to the erthe of which thou art takun.—Gen. iii. 19. Wiclif.
U||   And Cayn was wrooth greetli, and his cheer felde doun.—Gen. iv. 5.
U||   Wiclif.
U||   Each froward threatening cheer of fortune makes us plain;
U||   And every pleasant show revives our woful hearts again.
U||   Surrey, Ecclesiastes, c. 3.
U||   Chemist,   }
U||   Chemistry.
U||   The distinction between the alchemist and the ‘chemist,’ that the first
U||   is the fond searcher after the philosopher’s stone or the elixir vitæ,
U||   the other the follower of a true and scientific method in a particular
U||   region of nature, is of comparatively recent introduction into the
U||   language. ‘Chemist’ is = ‘alchemist’ in the quotations which follow.
U||   Five sorts of persones he [Sir Edward Coke] used to foredesign to
U||   misery and poverty; chemists, monopolizers, concealers,[283]10
U||   promoters, and rythming poets.—Fuller, Worthies of England: Norfolk.
U||   [Pg 46]
U||   I have observed generally of chymists and theosophists, as of several
U||   other men more palpably mad, that their thoughts are carried much to
U||   astrology.—H. More, A Brief Discourse of Enthusiasm, sect. 45.

U||   Their course here to direct;
U||   Like senseless chemists their own wealth destroy,
U||   Imaginary wealth to enjoy.

U||   Hence the fool’s paradise, the statesman’s scheme,
U||   The air-built castle, and the golden dream,

U||   The poet’s vision of eternal fame.
U||   Pope, The Dunciad, b. iii. 9-12.
U||   He that follows chemistry must have riches to throw away upon the study
U||   of it; whatever he gets by it, those furnaces must be fed with
U||   gold.—South, Sermons, 1644, vol. ix. p. 277.
U||   Chest. I am not aware that ‘cista’ was ever used in the sense of a
U||   coffin, but ‘chest’ is continually so used in our early English; and
U||   ‘to chest,’ for to place in a coffin, occurs in the heading of a
U||   chapter in our Bibles, Gen. l. 26: ‘He [Joseph] dieth, and is chested.’
U||   He is now deed and nayled in his chest.
U||   Chaucer, The Clerkes Prologue.
U||   Your body is now wrapt in chest,
U||   I pray to God to give your soul good rest.
U||   Hawes, Pastime of Pleasure, cap. 14.
U||   Chimney. This, which means now the gorge or vent of a furnace or fire,
U||   was once in frequent use for the furnace itself: in this more true to
U||   its origin; being derived from the Greek κάμινος, a furnace, as it
U||   passed into the Latin ‘caminus,’ whence the Late Latin caminata, a room
U||   with a stove, the French ‘cheminée.’ The fact that it is the ‘chimney,’
U||   in the modern use of the[Pg 47] word, which, creating a draught, alone
U||   gives activity or fierceness to the flame, probably explains the
U||   present limitation of the meaning of the word. In Scotland ‘chimney’
U||   still is, or lately was, ‘the grate, or iron frame that holds the fire’
U||   (Scoticisms, Edinburgh, 1787).
U||   And hise feet [were] lijk to latoun as in a brennynge chymney.—Rev. i.
U||   15. Wiclif.
U||   The Son of Man shall send his angels, and shall gather all hindrances
U||   out of his kingdom and all that worketh unlawfulness, and shall cast
U||   them into the chimney of fire.—Matt. xiii. 50. Sir John Cheke.
U||   Chivalry. It is a striking evidence of the extent to which in the
U||   feudal times the men-at-arms, the mounted knights, were esteemed as the
U||   army, while the footmen were regarded as little better than a
U||   supernumerary rabble,—another record of this contempt probably
U||   surviving at the other end in the word ‘infantry,’—that ‘chivalry,’
U||   which of course is but a doublet of ‘cavalry,’ could once be used as
U||   convertible with army. It needed more than one Agincourt to teach that
U||   this was so no longer. ‘Knighthood’ in like manner is continually used
U||   by Wiclif as a rendering of ‘exercitus;’ thus Gen. xxi. 33.
U||   Abymalach forsothe aroos, and Phicol, the prince of his chyvalrye
U||   [princeps exercitûs ejus, Vulg.], and turneden ayen into the loond of

U||   Wiclif.
U||   Chouse. The history of the introduction of this word into the popular,
U||   or at all events the schoolboy, language of England, and the quarter
U||   from whence derived, are now sufficiently well known. A ‘chiaus,’[Pg
U||   48] or interpreter, attached to the Turkish Embassy, in 1609 succeeded
U||   in defrauding the Turkish and Persian merchants resident in England of
U||   4,000l. From the vast dimensions of the fraud, vast, that is, as men
U||   counted fraudulent vastness then, and the notoriety it acquired, a
U||   ‘chiaus’ (presently spelt ‘chouse’ to look more English) became
U||   equivalent to a swindler, and somewhat later to the act of
U||   swindling.[284]11 It is curious that a correspondent of Skinner
U||   (Etymologicon, 1671), though quite ignorant of this story, suggests a
U||   connexion between ‘chouse’ and the Turkish ‘chiaus.’ The quotation from
U||   Ben Jonson gives us the word in its passage from the old meaning to the
U||   new; while the ‘errant chouse’ in Butler’s Hudibras, iii. 1, 1249, is
U||   rather the cheated than the cheater.
U||   About this time the Turks proposed at the instigation of the French
U||   ambassador to send a chiaus into France, England, and Holland, to
U||   acquaint those princes with the advancement of Sultan Solyman to the
U||   throne.—Rycaut, History of the Turks, vol. iii. p. 261.
U||   Dapper. What do you think of me,
U||   That I am a chiaus?

U||   As one would say, do you think I am a Turk?
U||   Ben Jonson, The Alchemist, act i. sc. 1.
U||   Christen,    }
U||   Christendom.
U||   By ‘Christendom’ we now understand that portion of the world which
U||   makes profession of the faith of Christ, as contradistinguished from
U||   all heathen and Mahomedan lands. But it was often used by our early
U||   writers as[Pg 49] itself the profession of Christ’s faith, or sometimes
U||   for baptism, inasmuch as in that this profession was made; which is
U||   also the explanation of the use of ‘christen’ as equivalent to
U||   ‘christianize’ below. In Shakespeare our present use of ‘Christendom’
U||   very much predominates, but once or twice he uses it in its earlier
U||   sense, as do authors much later than he.
U||   Most part of England in the reigne of King Ethelbert was christened,
U||   Kent onely except, which remayned long after in mysbeliefe and
U||   unchristened.—E. K., Glossary to Spenser’s Shepherd’s Calendar,
U||   September.[285]12
U||   Sothli we ben togidere biried with him bi christendom [per baptismum,
U||   Vulg.] in to death.—Rom. vi. 4. Wiclif (earlier version).
U||   He that might have his body wrapped in one of their old coats at the
U||   houre of death, it were as good to him as his christendom.—Tyndale,
U||   Exposition upon Matthew VI.
U||   They all do come to him with friendly face,
U||   When of his christendom they understand.
U||   Sir J. Harington, Orlando Furioso, b. xliii. c. 189.
U||   The draughts of intemperance would wash off the water of my
U||   christendom; every unclean lust does as it were bemire and wipe out my
U||   contract with my Lord.—Allestree, Sermons, vol. ii. p. 161.
U||   Church. Our Translators are often taxed with an oversight in that they
U||   have allowed ‘robbers of churches’ to remain at Acts xix. 37, as the
U||   rendering of ἱεροσύλους, sounding, as this does, like an anachronism on
U||   the lips of the town-clerk of Ephesus. Doubtless ‘spoilers of temples,’
U||   or some such phrase, would have been preferable; yet was there not any
U||   oversight here.[Pg 50] The title of ‘church,’ which we with a fit
U||   reverence restrain to a Christian place of worship, was in earlier
U||   English not refused to the Jewish, or, as in that place, even to a
U||   heathen, temple as well.
U||   And, lo, the veil of the church was torn in two parts from the top
U||   downwards.—Matt. xxvii. 51. Sir John Cheke.
U||   To all the gods devoutly she did offer frankincense,
U||   But most above them all the church of Juno she did cense.

U||   These troops should soon pull down the church of Jove.
U||   Marlowe, First Book of Lucan.
U||   Civil,    }
U||   Civility,
U||   Civilian.
U||   The tendency which there is in the meaning of words to run to the
U||   surface, till they lose and leave behind all their deeper significance,
U||   is well exemplified in ‘civil’ and ‘civility’—words of how deep an
U||   import once, how slight and shallow now. A civil man now is one
U||   observant of slight external courtesies in the intercourse of society;
U||   a civil man once was one who fulfilled all the duties and obligations
U||   flowing from his position as a ‘civis,’ and his relations to the other
U||   members of that ‘civitas’ to which he belonged, and ‘civility’ the
U||   condition in which those were recognized and observed. The gradual
U||   departure of all deeper significance from ‘civility’ has obliged the
U||   creation of another word, ‘civilization,’ which only came up toward the
U||   conclusion of the last century. Johnson does not know it in his
U||   Dictionary, except as a technical legal term to express the turning of
U||   a criminal process into a civil one; and, according to Boswell,
U||   altogether disallowed it in the sense which it has now acquired. A
U||   ‘civilian’ in the language of the Puritan[Pg 51] divines was one who,
U||   despising the righteousness of Christ, did yet follow after a certain
U||   civil righteousness, a ‘justitia civilis’ of his own.
U||   That wise and civil Roman, Julius Agricola, preferred the natural wits
U||   of Britain before the laboured studies of the French.—Milton,
U||   Areopagitica.
U||   As for the Scythian wandering Nomades, temples sorted not with their
U||   condition, as wanting both civility and settledness.—Fuller, The Holy
U||   State, b. iii. c. 24.
U||   Then were the Roman fashions imitated and the gown; after a while the
U||   incitements also and materials of vice and voluptuous life, proud
U||   buildings, baths, and the elegance of banquetings; which the foolisher
U||   sort called civility, but was indeed a secret art to prepare them for
U||   bondage.—Milton, History of England, b. ii.
U||   Let us remember also that civility and fair customs were but in a
U||   narrow circle till the Greeks and Romans beat the world into better
U||   manners.—Bishop Taylor, Ductor Dubitantium, b. ii. c. 1, § 19.
U||   The last step in this [spiritual] death is the death of civility. Civil
U||   men come nearer the saints of God than others, they come within a step
U||   or two of heaven, and yet are shut out.—Preston, Of Spiritual Death and
U||   Life, 1636, p. 59.
U||   I proceed to the second, that is to the mere naturalist or civilian; by
U||   whom I mean such an one as lives upon dregs, the very reliques and
U||   ruins of the image of God decayed.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 104.
U||   Clergy. [The use of clergy in the abstract for learning is quite
U||   obsolete. Strictly speaking, it is not the same word as clergy, the
U||   collective name for the ministers of God. Clergy (learning) represents
U||   Old French clergie, whereas clergy (ministers) is due to Old French
U||   clergié (now clergé) = Late Latin clericatum.]
U||   [Pg 52]
U||   Ne alle the clerkes that ever had witte
U||   Sen the world bigan, ne that lyfes yit,
U||   Couth never telle bi clergy ne arte
U||   Of these payns of helle the thousand parte.

U||   Also that every of the said landlords put their second sons to learn
U||   some clergy, or some craft, whereby they may live honestly.—State
U||   Papers, State of Ireland, 1515, vol. ii. p. 30.
U||   Climate. At present the temperature of a region, but once the region
U||   itself, the region, however, contemplated in its slope or inclination
U||   from the equator toward the pole, and therefore, by involved
U||   consequence, in respect of its temperature; which circumstance is the
U||   point of contact between the present meaning of ‘climate’ and the past.
U||   We have derived the word from the mathematical geographers of
U||   antiquity. They were wont to run imaginary parallel lines, or such at
U||   least as they intended should be parallel, to the equator; and the
U||   successive ‘climates’ (κλίματα) of the earth were the spaces and
U||   regions between these lines. See Holland’s Pliny, vol. i. p. 150.
U||   The superficialtee of the erthe is departed in 7 parties for the 7
U||   planetes, and tho parties ben clept clymates.—Mandeville, p. 186.

U||   distant by-twene them alle.—Chaucer, Treatise on the Astrolabe, 2, 39,

U||   When these prodigies
U||   Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,
U||   ‘These are their causes—they are natural;’

U||   Shakespeare, Julius Cæsar, act i. sc. 3.

U||   with fences that environ it naturally.—Holland, Ammianus, p. 47.
U||   Climate, a portion of the earth contained between two circles parallel
U||   to the equator.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   Clumsy. Although of no very frequent use in our early literature (it
U||   does not once occur in Shakespeare), this word cannot be said to be
U||   very rare; and where it occurs, it is in a sense going before its
U||   present, namely, in that of stiff, rigid, contracted with cold. It is
U||   familiar to all how ‘clumsy,’ in our modern use of the word, the
U||   fingers are when in this condition, and thus it is easy to trace the
U||   growing of the modern meaning out of the old. On its probable etymology
U||   see Mätzner’s Dictionary (s. v. clumsen).
U||   Rigido: Starke, stiffe, or num through cold, clumzie.—Florio, New World
U||   of Words (A.D. 1611).

U||   [Pg 54]
U||   Coffin. The Greek κόφινος, the Latin ‘cophinus,’ is not in our early
U||   English, exclusively a funeral chest for the dead, but as often used of
U||   any basket or maund.
U||   And that that lefte to hem of brokun metis was takun up, twelve
U||   cofyns.—Luke ix. 17. Wiclif.
U||   Tibin, a baskette or coffyn made of wyckers or bull-rushes, or barke of
U||   a tree; such oone was Moyses put in to by the daughter of Pharao.—Sir
U||   T. Elyot, quoted in Way’s Promptorium, p. 85.
U||   Comfort,     }
U||   Comfortable.
U||   The verb ‘comfortare,’ not found in classical Latin, but so frequent in
U||   the Vulgate, is first, as is plain from the ‘fortis’ which it embodies,
U||   to make strong, to corroborate, and only in a secondary sense, to
U||   console. We often find it in our early literature employed in that its
U||   proper sense. In the truce between England and Scotland, in the reign
U||   of Richard III., it is provided that neither of the kings shall
U||   maintain, favour, aid, or comfort any rebel or traitor (Hall, Richard
U||   III.).
U||   And the child wexide, and was coumfortid [confortabatur Vulg.] in
U||   spirit.—Luke i. 80. Wiclif.
U||   And there appered an angell unto Hym from heven, confortynge Hym
U||   [ἐνισχύων αὐτόν].—Luke xxii. 43. Tyndale.
U||   O comfortable friar! where is my lord?—Shakespeare, Romeo, act v. sc.
U||   3.
U||   Common sense. The manner is very curious in which the logical,
U||   metaphysical, and theological speculations, to which the busy world is
U||   indifferent, or from which it is entirely averse, do yet in their
U||   results descend to it, and are adopted by it; while it remains quite
U||   unconscious of the source from which they spring, and counts that it
U||   has created them for itself and out[Pg 55] of its own resources. Thus,
U||   many would wonder if asked the parentage of this phrase ‘common sense,’
U||   would count it the most natural thing in the world that such a phrase
U||   should have been formed, that it demanded no ingenuity to form it, that
U||   the uses to which it is now put are the same which it has served from
U||   the first. Indeed, neither Reid, Beattie, nor Stewart seems to have
U||   assumed anything else. But in truth this phrase, ‘common sense,’ meant
U||   once something very different from that plain wisdom, the common
U||   heritage of men, which now we call by this name; having been bequeathed
U||   to us by a very complex theory of the senses, and of a sense which was
U||   the common bond of them all, and which passed its verdicts on the
U||   reports which they severally made to it. This theory of κοινὸς νοῦς,
U||   familiar to the Greek metaphysicians (see Cicero, Tusc. Quæst. i. 20),
U||   is sufficiently explained by the interesting quotations from Henry More
U||   and Burton. In Hawes’ Pastime of Pleasure (cap. 24) the relation
U||   between the ‘common wit’ and the ‘five wits’ is at large set forth. For
U||   an interesting history of the phrase, see Sir William Hamilton’s
U||   edition of Reid’s Works, appendix A, especially pp. 757, &c.; and for
U||   some classical uses of it Horace, Sat. i. 3. 65; Juvenal, 8. 73;
U||   Seneca, Ep. 5. 3; 105. 4; De Benef. i. 12. 3; Quintilian, i. 2. 20.
U||   The senses receive indifferently, without discretion and judgement,
U||   white and black, sweet and sour, soft and hard; for their office is
U||   only to admit their several objects, and to carry and refer the
U||   judgement thereof to the common sense.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 732.
U||   But for fear to exceed the commission of an historian (who with the
U||   outward senses may only bring in the species,[Pg 56] and barely relate
U||   facts, not with the common sense pass verdict or censure on them), I
U||   would say they had better have built in some other place, especially
U||   having room enough besides, and left this floor, where the Temple
U||   stood, alone in her desolations.—Fuller, Holy War, b. i. c. 4.
U||   That there is some particular or restrained seat of the common sense is
U||   an opinion that even all philosophers and physicians are agreed upon.
U||   And it is an ordinary comparison amongst them, that the external senses
U||   and the common sense considered together are like a circle with five
U||   lines drawn from the circumference to the centre. Wherefore, as it has
U||   been obvious for them to find out particular organs for the external
U||   senses, so they have also attempted to assign some distinct part of the
U||   body to be an organ of the common sense; that is to say, as they
U||   discovered sight to be seated in the eye, hearing in the ear, smelling
U||   in the nose, &c., so they conceived that there is some part of the body
U||   wherein seeing, hearing, and all other perceptions meet together, as
U||   the lines of a circle in the centre, and that there the soul does also
U||   judge and discern of the difference of the objects of the outward
U||   senses.—H. More, Immortality of the Soul, b. iii. c. 13.
U||   Inner senses are three in number, so called because they be within the
U||   brain-pan, as common sense, phantasy, memory. Their objects are not
U||   only things present, but they perceive the sensible species of things
U||   to come, past, absent, such as were before in the sense. This common
U||   sense is the judge or moderator of the rest, by whom we discern all
U||   differences of objects; for by mine eye I do not know that I see, or by
U||   mine ear that I hear, but by my common sense, who judgeth of sounds and
U||   colours; they are but the organs to bring the species to be censured;
U||   so that all their objects are his, and all the offices are his. The
U||   fore part of the brain is his organ or seat.—Burton, Anatomy of
U||   Melancholy, part i. sect. 2.
U||   Companion. This had once the same contemptuous use which its synonym
U||   ‘fellow’ still retains (for a curious use of this see 2 Pet. ii. 14,
U||   Geneva Version), and which ‘gadeling,’ a word of the same[Pg 57]
U||   meaning, had, so long as it survived in the language. Clarendon speaks
U||   of the Privy Council as at one time composed of upstarts, factious,
U||   indigent companions (b. iv.). The notion originally involved in
U||   companionship, or accompaniment, would appear to have been rather that
U||   of inferiority than of equality. A companion was an attendant.
U||   What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
U||   Companion, hence.
U||   Shakespeare, Julius Cæsar, act iv. sc. 3
U||   As that empty barren companion in St. James who bids the poor be warm
U||   and fed and clothed (as if he were all made of mercy), yet neither
U||   clothes, feeds, nor warms his back, belly, or flesh, so fares it with
U||   these lovers.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 391.
U||   The young ladies, who thought themselves too much concerned to contain
U||   themselves any longer, set up their throats all together against my
U||   protector. ‘Scurvy companion! saucy tarpaulin! rude, impertinent
U||   fellow! did he think to prescribe to grandpapa!’—Smollett, Roderick
U||   Random, vol. i. c. 3.
U||   Conceited,   }
U||   Conceitedly.
U||   ‘Conceit’ is so entirely and irrecoverably lost to the language of
U||   philosophy, that it would be well if ‘concept,’ used often by our
U||   earlier philosophical writers, were revived.[286]13 Yet ‘conceit’ has
U||   not so totally forsaken all its former meanings (for there are still
U||   ‘happy conceits’ in poetry), as have ‘conceited,’ which once meant well
U||   conceived, and ‘conceitedly.’
U||   Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyn
U||   Which had on it conceited characters.
U||   Shakespeare, A Lover’s Complaint.
U||   Triumphal arches the glad town doth raise,
U||   [Pg 58]
U||   And tilts and tourneys are performed at court,
U||   Conceited masques, rich banquets, witty plays.
U||   Drayton, The Miseries of Queen Margaret.
U||   The edge or hem of a garment is distinguished from the rest most
U||   commonly by some conceited or costly work.—Cowell, The Interpreter, s.
U||   v. Broderess.
U||   Cicero most pleasantly and conceitedly.—Holland, Suetonius, p. 21.
U||   Concubine. Our Dictionaries do not notice that the male paramour no
U||   less than the female was sometimes called by this name; on the
U||   contrary, their definitions exclude this.
U||   The Lady Anne did falsely and traiterously procure divers of the King’s
U||   daily and familiar servants to be her adulterers and
U||   concubines.—Indictment of Anne Boleyn.
U||   Conjure. The quotation from Foxe shows that this use of ‘to conjure’ as
U||   to conspire is not, as one might at first suspect, one of Milton’s
U||   Latinisms, and as such peculiar to him.
U||   Divers, as well horsemen as footmen, had conjured among themselves and
U||   conspired against the Englishmen, selling their horses and arms
U||   aforehand.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs, 1641, vol. i. p. 441.
U||   Art thou that traitor angel? art thou he
U||   That first broke peace in heaven, and faith till then
U||   Unbroken, and, in proud rebellious arms,
U||   Drew after him the third part of Heaven’s sons,
U||   Conjured against the Highest?
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, ii. 689.
U||   Contemptible. ‘Adjectives in “able” and “ible,” both positive and
U||   negative ones, are frequently used[Pg 59] by old writers in an active
U||   sense’ (S. Walker, Criticisms on Shakespeare, vol. i. p. 183: whom
U||   see). ‘Contemptible’ where we should now use ‘contemptuous’ is one of
U||   these; ‘intenible’ (All’s Well that Ends Well, act i. sc. 3) another;
U||   ‘discernible’ a third.
U||   Darius wrote to Alexander in a proud and contemptible manner.—Lord
U||   Sterling, Darius, 1603 (in the argument prefixed to the Play).
U||   If she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn
U||   it, for the man, as you know all, hath a contemptible
U||   spirit.—Shakespeare, Much Ado about Nothing, act ii. sc. 3.
U||   I do not mock, nor lives there such a villain,
U||   That can do anything contemptible
U||   To you; but I do kneel, because it is
U||   An action very fit and reverent
U||   In presence of so pure a creäture.
U||   Beaumont and Fletcher, The Coxcomb, act v. sc. 2.
U||   Convince. This and ‘convict’ have been usefully desynonymized. One is
U||   ‘convinced’ of a sin, but ‘convicted’ of a crime; the former word
U||   moving always in the sphere of moral or intellectual things, but the
U||   latter often in that of things merely external.
U||   Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the
U||   honour of my mistress.—Shakespeare, Cymbeline, act i. sc. 4.
U||   Keep off that great concourse, whose violent hands
U||   Would ruin this stone-building and drag hence
U||   This impious judge, piecemeal to tear his limbs,
U||   Before the law convince him.
U||   Webster, Appius and Virginia, act v. sc. 5.
U||   There was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his
U||   words.—Job xxxii. 12. (A. V.)
U||   [Pg 60]
U||   Copy. A more Latin use of ‘copy,’ as ‘copia’ or abundance, was at one
U||   time frequent in English. It is easy to trace the steps by which the
U||   word attained its present significance. The only way to obtain ‘copy’
U||   (in this Latin sense) or abundance of any document, would be by taking
U||   ‘copies’ (in our present sense) of it. Then, too, it often meant the
U||   exemplar, and is so used in the quotations from Shakespeare and Jeremy
U||   Taylor.
U||   We cannot follow a better pattern for elocution than God Himself.
U||   Therefore He using divers words in his Holy Writ, and indifferently for
U||   one thing in nature, we may use the same liberty in our English
U||   versions out of Hebrew or Greek, for that copy or store that He hath
U||   given us.—The Translators [of the Bible, 1611] to the Reader.
U||   Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
U||   And teach them how to war.
U||   Shakespeare, Henry V. act iii. sc. 1.
U||   Drayton’s Heroical Epistles are well worth the reading also, for the
U||   purpose of our subject, which is to furnish an English historian with
U||   choice and copy of tongue.—Bolton, Hypercritica, p. 235.
U||   The sun, the prince of all the bodies of light, is the principal, the
U||   rule and the copy, which they in their proportions imitate and
U||   transcribe.—Bishop Taylor, Exhortation to the Imitation of Christ.
U||   Coquet. At present all our ‘coquets’ are female. But, as in the case
U||   with so many other words instanced in this volume, what once belonged
U||   to both sexes is now restricted to one.
U||   Cocquet; a beau, a gallant, a general lover; also a wanton girl that
U||   speaks fair to several lovers at once.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   [Pg 61]
U||   Corpse. Now only used for the body abandoned by the spirit of life, but
U||   once for the body of the living equally as of the dead; now only =
U||   ‘cadaver,’ but once ‘corpus’ as well. It will follow that ‘dead
U||   corpses’ (2 Kings xix. 35 and often) is not a tautology.
U||   A valiant corpse, where force and beauty met.
U||   Surrey, On the Death of Sir T. Wyatt.
U||   Night is the sabbath of mankind,
U||   To rest the body and the mind:
U||   Which now thou art denied to keep,
U||   And cure thy laboured corpse with sleep.
U||   Butler, Hudibras, iii. 1. 1349.
U||   Women and maids shall particularly examine themselves about the variety
U||   of their apparell, their too much care of their corps.—Richeome’s
U||   Pilgrim of Loretto, by G. W.
U||   Your conjuring, cozening, and your dozen of trades
U||   Could not relieve your corps with so much linen
U||   Would make you tinder, but to see a fire.
U||   Ben Jonson, The Alchemist, act i. sc. 1.
U||   Counterfeit. Now, to imitate with the purpose of passing off the
U||   imitation as the original; but no such dishonest intention was formerly
U||   implied in the word.
U||   I wol noon of thapostles counterfete:
U||   I wol have money, wolle, chese and whete,
U||   Al were it yeven of the prestes page,
U||   Or of the porest wydow in a village.
U||   Chaucer, The Pardoner’s Prologue (Morris, p. 90).
U||   Christ prayseth not the unrighteous stuard, neither setteth him forth
U||   to us to counterfeit, because of his unrighteousness, but because of
U||   his wisdom only, in that he with unright so wisely provided for
U||   himself.—Tyndale, The Parable of the Wicked Mammon.
U||   But for the Greek tongue they do note in some of his epistles that he
U||   [Brutus] counterfeited that brief compendious[Pg 62] manner of speech
U||   of the Lacedæmonians.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 818.
U||   Courtesan. The Low Latin ‘cortesanus’ was once one haunting the court,
U||   a courtier, ‘aulicus,’ though already in Shakespeare we often meet the
U||   word in its present use.
U||   By the wolf, no doubt, was meant the Pope, but the fox was resembled to
U||   the prelates, courtesans, priests, and the rest of the
U||   spirituality.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs, ed. 1641, vol. i. p. 511.
U||   Courtship. We now assign to this and to ‘courtesy’ their own several
U||   domains of meanings; but they were once promiscuously used. See for
U||   another example of the same the quotation from Fuller, s. v.
U||   ‘Defalcation.’
U||   As he [Charles I.], to acquit himself, hath not spared his adversaries,
U||   to load them with all sorts of blame and accusation, so to him, as in
U||   his book alive, there will be used no more courtship than he
U||   uses.—Milton, Iconoclastes, The Preface.
U||   Cumber,   }
U||   Cumbrous.
U||   This word, the Old French combrer, has lost much of the force which it
U||   once possessed; it means now little more than passively to burden. It
U||   was once actively to annoy, disquiet, or mischief. It was as possessing
U||   this force that our Translators rendered ἵνα τί καὶ τὴν γῆν καταργεῖ;
U||   ‘why cumbereth it the ground?’ (Luke xiii. 7.)
U||   The archers in the forefront so wounded the footmen, so galled the
U||   horses, and so combred the men of arms that the footmen durst not go
U||   forward.—Hall, Henry V. fol. 17, 6.
U||   We have herde that certayne of oures are departed, and have troubled
U||   you and have combred [ἀνασκευάζοντες] your[Pg 63] myndes, sayenge, Ye
U||   must be circumcised and must keep the law.—Acts xv. 24. Coverdale.
U||   But Martha was cumbered [περιεσπᾶτο, cf. ver. 41: μεριμνᾷs καὶ τυρβάζῃ]
U||   about much serving.—Luke x. 40. (A.V.)
U||   A cloud of combrous gnats do him molest,
U||   All striving to infix their feeble stings.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, i. 1. 23.
U||   Cunning. The fact that so many words implying knowledge, art, skill,
U||   obtain in course of time a secondary meaning of crooked knowledge, art
U||   that has degenerated into artifice, skill used only to circumvent,
U||   which meanings partially or altogether put out of use their primary, is
U||   a mournful witness to the way in which intellectual gifts are too
U||   commonly misapplied. Thus there was a time when the Latin ‘dolus’
U||   required the epithet ‘malus,’ as often as it signified a treacherous or
U||   fraudful device; but it was soon able to drop this as superfluous, and
U||   to stand by itself. Other words which have gone the same downward
U||   course are the following: τέχνη, ‘astutia,’ ‘calliditas,’ ‘List,’
U||   ‘Kunst,’ and our English ‘craft’ and ‘cunning,’—the last, indeed, as
U||   early as Lord Bacon, who says, ‘We take cunning for a sinister or
U||   crooked wisdom,’ had acquired what is now its only acceptation; but not
U||   then, nor till long after, to the exclusion of its more honourable use.
U||   How honourable that use sometimes was, my first quotation will testify.
U||   I believe that all these three Persons [in the Godhead] are even in
U||   power and in cunning and in might, full of grace and of all
U||   goodness.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs; Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   So the number of them, with their brethren, that were instructed in the
U||   songs of the Lord, even all that were[Pg 64] cunning, was two hundred
U||   fourscore and eight.—1 Chron. xxv. 7. (A.V.)
U||   Curate. Rector, vicar, every one having cure of souls in a parish, was
U||   a ‘curate’ once. Thus ‘bishops and curates’ in the Liturgy.
U||   They [the begging friars] letten curats to know Gods law by holding
U||   bookes fro them, and withdrawing of their vantages, by which they
U||   shulden have books and lerne.—Wiclif, Treatise against the Friars, p.
U||   56.
U||   If there be any man wicked because his curate teacheth him not, his
U||   blood shall be required at the curate’s hands.—Latimer, Sermons, p.
U||   525.
U||   Henry the Second of England commanded all prelates and curates to
U||   reside upon their dioceses and charges.—Bishop Taylor, Ductor
U||   Dubitantium, b. iii. c. 1.
U||   Curate, a parson or vicar, one that serves a cure, or has the charge of
U||   souls in a parish.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   Customer. One sitting officially at the receipt of customs, that is, of
U||   dues customably paid, and receiving these, and not one repairing
U||   customably to a shop to purchase there, was a ‘customer’ two and three
U||   centuries ago.
U||   He healeth the man of the palsye, calleth Levi the customer, eateth
U||   with open synners, and excuseth his disciples.—What S. Marke
U||   conteyneth. Coverdale.
U||   The extreme and horrible covetousness of the farmers, customers, and
U||   Roman usurers devoured it [Asia].—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 432.
U||   We hardly can abide publicans, customers, and toll-gatherers, when they
U||   keep a ferreting and searching for such things as be hidden.—Holland,
U||   Plutarch’s Morals, p. 138.
U||   Danger, [Pg 65] }
U||   Dangerous.
U||   A feudal term, beset with many difficulties when we seek to follow it
U||   as it passes to its present use; but very well worth some study
U||   bestowed upon it. Ducange has written on the subject, and Diez, and
U||   Littré (Hist. de la Langue Franç. vol. i. p. 49). [The Old French
U||   dangier, dongier, power, lordship, refusal, danger, is of Late Latin
U||   origin, representing a form dominiarium (from Latin dominium) which
U||   signified properly the strict right of the suzerain in regard to the
U||   fief of the vassal]; thus, ‘fief de danger,’ a fief held under a lord
U||   on strict conditions, and therefore in peril of being forfeited (juri
U||   stricto atque adeo confiscationi obnoxium; Ducange). There is no
U||   difficulty here; but there is another early use of ‘danger’ and
U||   ‘dangerous’ which is not thus explained, nor yet the connexion between
U||   it and the modern meaning of the words. I refer to that of ‘danger’ in
U||   the sense of ‘coyness,’ ‘sparingness,’ ‘niggardliness,’ and of
U||   ‘dangerous’ in the sense of haughty, difficult to please.
U||   And if thi voice is faire and clere,
U||   Thou shalt maken no grete daungere,
U||   Whanne to synge they goodly preye;
U||   It is thi worship for tobeye.
U||   Romaunt of the Rose, 2317.
U||   We ourselves also were in times past unwise, disobedient, deceived, in
U||   danger to lusts [δουλεύοντες ἐπιθυμίαις].—Tit. iii. Tyndale.
U||   Come not within his danger by thy will.
U||   Shakespeare, Venus and Adonis.
U||   My wages ben full streyt and eek ful smale;
U||   My lord to me is hard and daungerous.
U||   Chaucer, The Freres Tale (Morris, p. 250).
U||   [Pg 66]
U||   But nathelesse, for hys beauté
U||   So fyers and daungerous was he,
U||   That he nolde graunte hir askyng,
U||   For weepyng, ne for faire praiyng.
U||   Romaunt of the Rose, 1480.
U||   Deadly. This and ‘mortal’ (which see) are sometimes synonyms now; thus,
U||   ‘a deadly wound’ or ‘a mortal wound;’ but they are not invariably so;
U||   ‘deadly’ being always active, while ‘mortal’ is far oftenest passive,
U||   signifying not that which inflicts death, but that which suffers death;
U||   thus, ‘a mortal body,’ or body subject to death, but not now ‘a deadly
U||   body.’ It was otherwise once. ‘Deadly’ is the constant word in Wiclif’s
U||   Bible, wherever in the later Versions ‘mortal’ occurs.
U||   Elye was a deedli man lijk us, and in preier he preiede that it schulde
U||   not reyne on the erthe, and it reynede not three yeeris and sixe
U||   monethis.—Jam. v. 17. Wiclif.
U||   Many holy prophets that were deadly men were martyred violently in the
U||   Old Law.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs; Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   Debate,  }
U||   Debater.
U||   This word was only true to its etymology (débattre) so long as an
U||   element of strife, of war waged by the tongue or by the sword, was
U||   included in it. Thus, in some memorable lines attributed to Queen
U||   Elizabeth, Mary Queen of Scots is described as ‘the daughter of
U||   debate.’ It has now a far more harmless meaning, the element of strife
U||   having quite gone out of the word.
U||   It is not the possession of a man’s own, but the usurping of another
U||   man’s right that hath brought injustice, debate, and trouble into the
U||   world.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 680.
U||   [Pg 67]
U||   Prevy bacbiteris, detractouris, hateful to God, debateris
U||   [contumeliosi, Vulg.], proude.—Rom. i. 30. Wiclif.
U||   Deceivable,     }
U||   Deceivableness.
U||   So far as we use ‘deceivable’ at all now, we use it in the passive
U||   sense, as liable to be, or capable of being, deceived. It was active
U||   when counted exchangeable with ‘deceitful’ as at 2 Pet. i. 16, where
U||   the ‘deceivable’ of Tyndale appears as the ‘deceitful’ of Cranmer’s
U||   Bible. It has fared in like manner with ‘discernible,’ ‘contemptible,’
U||   which see, and with other words which, active once, are passive now.
U||   This world is fikel and desayvable,
U||   And fals and unsiker, and unstable.
U||   Richard Rolle de Hampole, Pricke of Conscience, 1088.
U||   The most uncertain and deceivable proof of the people’s good will and
U||   cities’ toward kings and princes are the immeasurable and extreme
U||   honours they do unto them.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 743.
U||   For we folowed not decevable fables, when we openned unto you the power
U||   and commynge of our Lorde Jesus Christ.—2 Pet. i. 16. Geneva Version.
U||   Whose coming is after the working of Satan with all deceivableness of
U||   unrighteousness in them that perish.—2 Thess. 9, 10. (A.V.)
U||   Defalcation. A word at present of very slovenly and inaccurate use. We
U||   read in the newspapers of a ‘defalcation’ of the revenue, not meaning
U||   thereby an active lopping off (‘defalcatio’) of certain taxes with
U||   their proceeds, which would be the only correct use, but a passive
U||   falling short in its returns from what they previously were. Can it be
U||   that some confusion of ‘defalcation’ with ‘default,’ or at least a
U||   seeing of[Pg 68] ‘fault’ and not ‘falx’ in its second syllable (there
U||   was once a verb ‘to defalk’), has led to this?
U||   My first crude meditations, being always hastily put together, could
U||   never please me so well at a second and more leisurable review, as to
U||   pass without some additions, defalcations, and other alterations, more
U||   or less.—Sanderson, Sermons, 1671, Preface.
U||   As for their conjecture that Zorobabel, at the building of this temple
U||   purposely abated of those dimensions assigned by Cyrus, as too great
U||   for him to compass, in such defalcation of measures by Cyrus allowed,
U||   he showed little courtship to his master the emperor, and less religion
U||   to the Lord his God.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. iii. c. 2.
U||   Defend,  }
U||   Defence.
U||   Now, to protect, but once to protect by prohibiting or fencing round,
U||   to forbid, as ‘défendre’ is still in French.
U||   Now wol I you defenden hasardrye.—Chaucer, The Pardoneres Tale. (Clar.
U||   Press.)
U||   Whan sawe ye in eny maner age
U||   That highe God defendide mariage
U||   By expres word?
U||   Id., The Wife of Bath’s Tale.
U||   And oure Lord defended hem that thei scholde not tell that avisioun
U||   till that He were rysen.—Sir John Mandeville, Voiage and Travaile, p.
U||   114.
U||   O sons, like one of us man is become,
U||   To know both good and evil, since his taste
U||   Of that defended fruit.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, xi. 84.
U||   Adam afterward ayeines his defence,
U||   Frette of that fruit.
U||   Piers Plowman, B-text, Passus xviii. 193.
U||   Defy,     }
U||   Defiance.
U||   This means now to dare to the uttermost hostility, and so, as a
U||   consequence which will often follow upon this, to[Pg 69] challenge. But
U||   in earlier use ‘to defy’ is, according to its etymology, to pronounce
U||   all bonds of faith and fellowship which existed previously between the
U||   defier and the defied to be wholly dissolved, so that nothing of treaty
U||   or even of the natural faith of man to man shall henceforth hinder
U||   extremest hostility between them. But still, when we read of one
U||   potentate sending ‘defiance’ to another, the challenge to conflict did
U||   not lie necessarily in the word, however such a message might provoke
U||   and would often be the prelude to this: it meant but the releasing of
U||   himself from all which hitherto had mutually obliged; and thus it came
U||   often to mean simply to disclaim, or renounce.
U||   No man speaking in the Spirit of God defieth Jesus [λέγει ἀνάθεμα
U||   Ἰησοῦν].—1 Cor. xii. 3. Tyndale.
U||   Despise not an hungry soul, and defy not the poor in his
U||   necessity.—Ecclus. iv. 2. Coverdale.
U||   All studies here I solemnly defy,
U||   Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke.
U||   Shakespeare, 1 Henry IV. act i. sc. 8.
U||   There is a double people-pleasing. One sordid and servile, made of
U||   falsehood and flattery, which I defy and detest.—Fuller, Appeal of
U||   Injured Innocence, p. 38.
U||   Now although I instanced in a question which by good fortune never came
U||   to open defiance, yet there have been sects formed upon lighter
U||   grounds.—Bishop Taylor, Liberty of Prophesying, § 3, 5.
U||   Delay. Like the French ‘délayer,’ used often in old time where we
U||   should now employ ‘allay.’ Out of an ignorance of this, and assuming it
U||   a misprint, some modern editors of our earlier authors have not
U||   scrupled to change ‘delay’ into ‘allay.’ This is quite a different word
U||   from delay, to put off.
U||   [Pg 70]
U||   Wine delayed with water.—Holland’s Camden, p. 20.
U||   The watery showers delay the raging wind.
U||   Earl of Surrey, The Faithful Lover, p. 34 (ed. 1717).
U||   Even so fathers ought to delay their eager reprehensions and cutting
U||   rebukes with kindness and clemency.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 16.
U||   Cup-bearers know well enough, and in that regard can discern and
U||   distinguish, when they are to use more or less water to the delaying of
U||   wines.—Id., Ib. p. 652.
U||   Delicacy,   }
U||   Delicate,
U||   Delicately,
U||   Delicious,
U||   Deliciously.
U||   In the same way as self-indulgence creeps over us by unmarked degrees,
U||   so there creeps over the words that designate it a subtle change; they
U||   come to contain less and less of rebuke and blame; the thing itself
U||   being tolerated, nay allowed, it must needs be that the words which
U||   express it should be received into favour too. It has been thus, as I
U||   shall have occasion to note, with ‘luxury;’ it has been thus also with
U||   this whole group of words. See the quotation from Sir W. Raleigh, s. v.
U||   ‘Feminine.’
U||   Thus much of delicacy in general; now more particularly of his first
U||   branch, gluttony.—Nash, Christ’s Tear’s over Jerusalem, p. 140.
U||   Cephisodorus, the disciple of Isocrates, charged him with delicacy,
U||   intemperance, and gluttony.—Blount, Philostratus, p. 229.
U||   The most delicate and voluptuous princes have ever been the heaviest
U||   oppressors of the people, riot being a far more lavish spender of the
U||   common treasure than war or magnificence.—Habington, History of King
U||   Edward IV., p. 196.
U||   And drynk nat ouer delicatliche, ne to depe neither.
U||   Piers Plowman, C-text, Passus vii. 166 (Skeat).
U||   She that liveth delicately [σπαταλῶσα] is dead while she liveth.—1 Tim.
U||   v. 6. A.V. (margin).
U||   [Pg 71]
U||   Yea, soberest men it [idleness] makes delicious.—Sylvester, Du Bartas,
U||   Second Week, Eden.
U||   How much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously [ἐστρηνίασε],
U||   so much torment and sorrow give her.—Rev. xviii. 7. (A.V.)
U||   Demerit. It was plainly a squandering of the wealth of the language,
U||   that ‘merit’ and ‘demerit’ should mean one and the same thing; however
U||   this might be justified by the fact that ‘mereor’ and ‘demereor,’ from
U||   which they were severally derived, were scarcely discriminated in
U||   meaning. It has thus come to pass, according to the desynonymizing
U||   processes ever at work in a language, that ‘demerit’ has ended in being
U||   employed only of ill desert, while ‘merit’ is left free to good or ill,
U||   having predominantly the sense of the former.
U||   I fetch my life and being
U||   From men of royal siege; and my demerits
U||   May speak, unbonneted, to as proud a fortune
U||   As this that I have reached.
U||   Shakespeare, Othello, act i. sc. 2.
U||   By our profane and unkind civil wars the world is grown to this pass,
U||   that it is reputed a singular demerit and gracious act, not to kill a
U||   citizen of Rome, but to let him live.—Holland, Pliny, vol. i. p. 456.
U||   But the Rhodians, contrariwise, in a proud humour of theirs, reckoned
U||   up a beadroll of their demerits toward the people of Rome.—Id., Livy,
U||   p. 1179.
U||   Demure,     }
U||   Demureness.
U||   Used by our earlier writers without the insinuation, which is now
U||   always latent in it, that the external shows of modesty and sobriety
U||   rest upon no corresponding realities. On the contrary the ‘demure’ was
U||   the truly modest and virtuous and good. It is one of the many words
U||   to[Pg 72] which the suspicious nature of man, with the warrants to a
U||   certain extent which these suspicions find, has given a turn for the
U||   worse.
U||   These and other suchlike irreligious pranks did this Dionysius play,
U||   who notwithstanding fared no worse than the most demure and innocent,
U||   dying no other death than what usually other mortals do.—H. More,
U||   Antidote against Atheism, b. iii. c. 1.
U||   Which advantages God propounds to all the hearers of the Gospel,
U||   without any respect of works or former demureness of life, if so be
U||   they will but now come in and close with this high and rich
U||   dispensation.—Id., Grand Mystery of Godliness, b. viii. c. 5.
U||   She is so nice and so demure,
U||   So sober, courteous, modest, and precise.
U||   True History of King Leir, 1605.
U||   In like manner women also in comely attire; with demureness [cum
U||   verecundiâ, Vulg.] and sobriety adorning themselves.—1 Tim. ii. 9.
U||   Rheims.
U||   His carriage was full comely and upright,
U||   His countenance demure and temperate.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, ii. 1, 6.
U||   Depart. Once used as equivalent with ‘to separate’ (divido, partior,
U||   Promptorium Parvulorum)—a fact already forgotten, when, at the last
U||   revision of the Prayer-Book in 1662, the Puritan divines objected to
U||   the form as it then stood in the Marriage Service, ‘till death us
U||   depart;’ in condescension to whose objection the words, as we now have
U||   them, ‘till death us do part,’ were introduced.
U||   And he schal departe hem atwynne, as a scheepherde departith scheep fro
U||   kidis.—Matt. xxv. 32. Wiclif.
U||   And whanne he hadde seid this thing, dissencioun was maad bitwixe the
U||   Fariseis and the Saduceis, and the multitude was departid.—Acts xxiii.
U||   7. Id.
U||   [Pg 73]
U||   If my neighbour neede and I geve him not, neyther depart liberally with
U||   him of that which I have, than withholde I from him unrighteously that
U||   which is hys owne.—Tyndale, Parable of the Wicked Mammon.
U||   Neither did the apostles put away their wives, after they were called
U||   unto the ministry; but they continued with their wives lovingly and
U||   faithfully, till death departed them.—Becon, An Humble Supplication
U||   unto God (1554).
U||   Deplored. It is well known that ‘deploratus’ obtained in later Latin,
U||   through a putting of effect for cause, the sense of desperate or past
U||   all hope, and was technically applied to the sick man given over by his
U||   physicians, ‘deploratus a medicis.’
U||   The physicians do make a kind of scruple and religion to stay with the
U||   patient after the disease is deplored; whereas, in my judgement, they
U||   ought both to inquire the skill, and to give the attendances, for the
U||   facilitating and assuaging of the pains and agonies of death.—Bacon,
U||   Advancement of Learning, ii. 10. 5.
U||   If a man hath the mind to get the start of other sinners, and desires
U||   to be in hell before them, he need do no more but open his sails to the
U||   wind of heretical doctrine, and he is like to make a short voyage to
U||   hell; for these bring upon their maintainers a swift destruction. Nay,
U||   the Spirit of God the more to aggravate their deplored state, brings on
U||   three most dreadful instances of divine justice that ever were executed
U||   upon any sinners.—Gurnall, The Christian in Complete Armour, pt. ii. p.
U||   317.
U||   Deprave. As ‘pravus’ is literally crooked, we may say that ‘to deprave’
U||   was formerly ‘untruly to present as crooked,’ to defame; while it is
U||   now ‘wickedly to make crooked.’ See the quotation from Bacon, s.v.
U||   ‘Disable.’
U||   Their intent was none other than to get him [Cardinal Wolsey] from the
U||   king out of the realm; then might they sufficiently adventure, by the
U||   help of their chief mistress, to[Pg 74] deprave him with the king’s
U||   highness, and so in his absence to bring him in displeasure with the
U||   king.—Cavendish, Life of Cardinal Wolsey.
U||   That lie, and cog, and flout, deprave, and slander.
U||   Shakespeare, Much Ado about Nothing, act v. sc. 1.
U||   I am depraved unjustly; who never deprived the Church of her
U||   authority.—Fuller, Appeal of Injured Innocence, pt. i. p. 45.
U||   Unjustly thou depravest it with the name
U||   Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,
U||   Or nature.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, vi. 174.
U||   Derive. Tropical uses of the verb ‘to derive’ have quite superseded the
U||   literal, so that we now ‘derive’ anything rather than waters from a
U||   river.
U||   An infinite deal of labour there is to lade out the water that riseth
U||   upon the workmen, for fear it choke up the pits; for to prevent which
U||   inconvenience they derive it by other drains.—Holland, Plutarch’s
U||   Morals.
U||   Nor may the industry of the citizens of Salisbury be forgotten, who
U||   have derived the river into every street therein, so that Salisbury is
U||   a heap of islets thrown together.—Fuller, Worthies of England:
U||   Wiltshire.
U||   Descry. This verb had a technical meaning in the seventeenth century,
U||   which it afterwards lost; its loss leading to the introduction of the
U||   French verb ‘to reconnoitre,’ ridiculed as an outlandish term by
U||   Addison (1711), and more than half a century later not admitted by
U||   Johnson into his Dictionary. It was exactly this which ‘to descry,’ as
U||   used by Shakespeare and by Milton, meant. [The verb is the equivalent
U||   of the Old French descrire, descrivre, Latin describere, to describe.]
U||   Who hath descried the number of the foe?
U||   Shakespeare, Richard III. act v. sc. 3.
U||   [Pg 75]
U||   The house of Israel sent to descry (to spy out, R.V.) Bethel.—Judg. i.
U||   23. (A.V.)
U||   Scouts each coast light-armed scour,
U||   Each quarter to descry the distant foe,
U||   Where lodged or whither fled; or, if for fight,
U||   In motion or in halt.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, vi. 530.
U||   Desire. ‘To desire’ is only to look forward with longing now; the word
U||   has lost the sense of regret or looking back upon the lost but still
U||   loved. This it once possessed in common with ‘desiderium’ and
U||   ‘desiderare,’ from which more remotely, and ‘désirer,’ from which more
U||   immediately, we derive it.
U||   He [Jehoram] reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without
U||   being desired.—2 Chron. xxi. 20. (A.V.)
U||   She that hath a wise husband must entice him to an eternal dearness by
U||   the veil of modesty and the grave robes of chastity, and she shall be
U||   pleasant while she lives, and desired when she dies.—Bishop Taylor, The
U||   Marriage Ring, Sermon 18.
U||   So unremovéd stood these steeds, their heads to earth let fall,
U||   And warm tears gushing from their eyes, with passionate desire
U||   Of their kind manager.
U||   Chapman, Homer’s Iliad, xvii. 379.
U||   Detest. For the writers of the seventeenth century ‘to detest’ still
U||   retained often the sense of its original ‘detestari,’ openly to witness
U||   against, and not merely to entertain an inward abhorrence of, a thing;
U||   as in ‘attest’ and ‘protest’ the etymological meaning still survives.
U||   It is not easy to adduce passages which absolutely prove this against
U||   one who should be disposed to deny it. There can, however, be no doubt
U||   whatever of the fact. In Du Bartas’ Weeks, 1621, p. 106, an invective
U||   against avarice is called in[Pg 76] the margin ‘Detestation of Avarice,
U||   for her execrable and cruel effects.’
U||   Wherefore God hath detested them with his own mouth, and clean given
U||   them over unto their own filthy lusts.—Bale, The Image of both
U||   Churches, c. 11.
U||   She cast herself upon him [her dead husband], and with fearful cries
U||   detested the governor’s inhuman and cruel deceit.—Grimeston, History of
U||   Lewis XI., 1614, p. 228.
U||   Satyrs were certain poems, detesting and reproving the misdemeanours of
U||   people and their vices.—Holland, Explanation of certain obscure words.
U||   E’en to vice
U||   They [women] are not constant, but are changing still
U||   One vice but of a minute old, for one
U||   Not half so old as that. I’ll write against them,
U||   Detest them, curse them.
U||   Shakespeare, Cymbeline, act ii. sc. 5.
U||   Diamond. This, or ‘diamant’ as it used to be spelt, is a popular form
U||   of ‘adamant.’ The Greek ἀδάμας, originally used of the hardest steel,
U||   was, about the time of Theophrastus, and, so far as we know, first in
U||   his writings, transferred to the diamond, as itself also of a hardness
U||   not to be subdued; the cutting or polishing of this stone being quite a
U||   modern invention; and the Latin ‘adamas’ continued through the Middle
U||   Ages to bear this double meaning. But if ‘adamant’ meant diamond, then
U||   ‘diamond,’ by a reactive process frequent in language, would be
U||   employed for adamant as well. So far as I know, Milton is the last
U||   writer who so uses it.
U||   Have harte as hard as diamaunt,
U||   Stedfast, and nauht pliaunt.
U||   Romaunt of the Rose.
U||   This little care and regard did at length melt and break asunder those
U||   strong diamond chains with which Dionysius[Pg 77] the elder made his
U||   boast that he left his tyranny chained to his son.—North, Plutarch’s
U||   Lives, 1656, p. 800.
U||   But wordes and lookes and sighes she did abhore,
U||   As rock of diamond stedfast evermore.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, i. 6. 4.
U||   Prince Arthur gave a boxe of diamond sure.
U||   Spenser, ib. i. 9. 19.
U||   Zeal, whose substance is ethereal, arming in complete diamond, ascends
U||   his fiery chariot drawn with two blazing meteors, figured like beasts,
U||   but of a higher breed than any the zodiack yields, resembling two of
U||   those four, which Ezekiel and St. John saw, the one visaged like a lion
U||   to express power, high authority, and indignation; the other of
U||   countenance like a man to cast derision and scorn upon perverse and
U||   fraudulent seducers; with these the invincible warrior Zeal shaking
U||   loosely the slack reins drives over the heads of scarlet prelates, and
U||   such as are insolent to maintain traditions, bruising their stiff necks
U||   under his flaming wheels.—Milton, Defence of Smectymnuus.
U||   On each wing
U||   Uriel and Raphaël his vaunting foe,
U||   Though huge and in a rock of diamond armed,
U||   Vanquished, Adramelech and Asmodai.
U||   Id., Paradise Lost, vi. 363.
U||   Diffidence,  }
U||   Diffidently.
U||   ‘Diffidence’ expresses now a not unbecoming distrust of one’s own self,
U||   with only a slight intimation, such as ‘verecundia’ obtained in the
U||   silver age of Latin literature, that perhaps this distrust is carried
U||   too far; but it was once used for distrust of others, and sometimes for
U||   distrust pushed so far as to amount to an entire withholding of all
U||   faith from them, being nearly allied to despair; as indeed in The
U||   Pilgrim’s Progress Mistress Diffidence is Giant Despair’s wife.
U||   Of the impediments which have been in the affections, the principal
U||   whereof hath been despair or diffidence, and[Pg 78] the strong
U||   apprehension of the difficulty, obscurity, and infiniteness, which
U||   belongeth to the invention of knowledge.—Bacon, Of the Interpretation
U||   of Nature, c. 19.
U||   Every sin smiles in the first address, and carries light in the face,
U||   and honey in the lip; but when we have well drunk, then comes that
U||   which is worse, a whip with ten strings, fears and terrors of
U||   conscience, and shame and displeasure, and a caitiff disposition, and
U||   diffidence in the day of death.—Bishop Taylor, Life of Christ.
U||   That affliction grew heavy upon me, and weighed me down even to a
U||   diffidence of God’s mercy.—Donne, Sermons, 1640, vol. i. p. 311.
U||   Mediators were not wanting that endeavoured a renewing of friendship
U||   between these two prelates, which the haughtiness, or perhaps the
U||   diffidence of Bishop Laud would not accept; a symptom of policy more
U||   than of grace, not to trust a reconciled enemy.—Hacket, Life of
U||   Archbishop Williams, pt. ii. p. 86.
U||   It was far the best course to stand diffidently against each other,
U||   with their thoughts in battle array.—Hobbes, Thucydides, b. iii. c. 83.
U||   Digest. Scholars of the seventeenth century often employ a word of
U||   their own language in the same latitude which its equivalent possessed
U||   in the Greek or the Latin; as though it entered into all the rights of
U||   its equivalent, and corresponded with it on all points, because it
U||   corresponded in one. Thus ‘coctus’ meaning ‘digested,’ why should not
U||   ‘digested’ mean all which ‘coctus’ meant? but one of the meanings of
U||   ‘coctus’ is ‘ripened;’ ‘digested’ therefore might be employed in the
U||   same sense.
U||   Repentance is like the sun; it produces rich spices in Arabia, it
U||   digests the American gold, and melts the snows from the Riphæan
U||   mountains.—Bishop Taylor, Doctrine and Practice of Repentance, ch. 10,
U||   § 8.
U||   [Pg 79]
U||   Splendid fires, aromatic spices, rich wines, and well-digested
U||   fruits.—Id., Discourse of Friendship.
U||   Disable. Our ancestors felt that to injure the character of another was
U||   the most effectual way of disabling him; and out of a sense of this
U||   they often used ‘to disable’ in the sense of to disparage, to speak
U||   slightingly of.
U||   Farewell, mounsieur traveller. Look, you lisp, and wear strange suits:
U||   disable all the benefits of your own country.—Shakespeare, As You Like
U||   It, act. iv. sc. 1.
U||   If affection lead a man to favour the less worthy in desert, let him do
U||   it without depraving or disabling the better deserver.—Bacon, Essays,
U||   49.
U||   Discourse. It is very characteristic of the slight acquaintance with
U||   our elder literature—the most obvious source for elucidating
U||   Shakespeare’s text—which was possessed by many of his commentators down
U||   to a late day, that the phrase ‘discourse of reason,’ which he puts
U||   into Hamlet’s mouth, should have perplexed them so greatly. Gifford, a
U||   pitiless animadverter on the real or imaginary mistakes of others, and
U||   who tramples upon Warburton for attempting to explain this phrase as
U||   though Shakespeare could have ever written it, declares ‘“discourse of
U||   reason” is so poor and perplexed a phrase that I should dismiss it at
U||   once for what I believe to be his genuine language;’ and then proceeds
U||   to suggest the obvious but erroneous correction ‘discourse and reason’
U||   (see his Massinger, vol. i. p. 148); while yet, if there be a phrase of
U||   continual recurrence among the writers of our Elizabethan age and down
U||   to Milton, it is this. I have little doubt that it occurs fifty
U||   times[Pg 80] in Holland’s translation of Plutarch’s Moralia. What our
U||   fathers intended by ‘discourse’ and ‘discourse of reason,’ the
U||   following passages will abundantly declare.
U||   There is not so great difference and distance between beast and beast,
U||   as there is odds in the matter of wisdom, discourse of reason, and use
U||   of memory between man and man.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 570; cf.
U||   pp. 313, 566, 570, 752, 955, 966, 977, 980.
U||   If you mean, by discourse, right reason, grounded on Divine Revelation
U||   and common notions, written by God in the hearts of all men, and
U||   deducing, according to the never-failing rules of logic, consequent
U||   deductions from them; if this be it which you mean by discourse, it is
U||   very meet and reasonable and necessary that men, as in all their
U||   actions, so especially in that of greatest importance, the choice of
U||   their way to happiness, should be left unto it.—Chillingworth, The
U||   Religion of Protestants, Preface.
U||   As the intuitive knowledge is more perfect than that which insinuates
U||   itself into the soul gradually by discourse, so more beautiful the
U||   prospect of that building which is all visible at one view than what
U||   discovers itself to the sight by parcels and degrees.—Fuller, Worthies
U||   of England: Canterbury.
U||   Whence the soul
U||   Reason receives, and reason is her being,
U||   Discursive or intuitive; discourse
U||   Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, v. 486.
U||   You, being by nature given to melancholic discoursing, do easilier
U||   yield to such imaginations.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 830.
U||   The other gods, and knights-at-arms, all slept, but only Jove
U||   Sweet slumber seized not; he discoursed how best he might approve
U||   His vow made for Achilles’ grace.
U||   Chapman, Homer’s Iliad, b. ii.
U||   [Pg 81]
U||   Discover. This word has lost the sense of uncover, which once it had,
U||   and in which it occurs several times in our Bible.
U||   Whether any man hath pulled down or discovered any church, chancel or
U||   chapel, or any part of them.—Archbishop Grindal, Articles of Enquiry,
U||   1576.
U||   The voice of the Lord discovereth the forests.—Ps. xxix. 9. A.V. and
U||   P.B.V.
U||   Disease. Our present limitation of ‘disease’ is a very natural one,
U||   seeing that nothing so effectually wars against ease as a sick and
U||   suffering condition of body. Still the limitation is modern, and by
U||   ‘disease’ was once meant any distress or discomfort whatever, and the
U||   verb had a corresponding meaning.
U||   Wo to hem that ben with child, and norishen in tho daies, for a greet
U||   diseese [pressura magna, Vulg.] schal be on the erthe and wraththe to
U||   this puple.—Luke xxi. 23. Wiclif.
U||   Thy doughter is deed; why diseasest thou the master eny further?—Mark
U||   v. 35. Tyndale.
U||   This is now the fourteenth day they [the Cardinals] have been in the
U||   Conclave, with such pain and disease that your grace would marvel that
U||   such men as they would suffer it.—State Papers (Letter to Wolsey from
U||   his Agent at Rome), vol. vi. p. 182.
U||   His double burden did him sore disease.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, ii. 2, 12.
U||   Dismal. Minsheu’s derivation of ‘dismal,’ that it is ‘dies malus,’ the
U||   unlucky, ill-omened day, is exactly one of those plausible etymologies
U||   which one learns after a while to reject with contempt. Yet there can
U||   be no doubt that our fathers so understood the word, and that this
U||   assumed etymology often overrules their usage of it.
U||   [Pg 82]
U||   Why should we then be bold to call them evil, infortunate, and dismal
U||   days? If God rule our doings continually, why shall they not prosper on
U||   those days as well as on other?—Pilkington, Exposition on Aggeus, c. 1.
U||   Then began they to reason and debate about the dismal days [tum de
U||   diebus religiosis agitari cœptum]. And the fifteenth day before the
U||   Kalends of August, so notorious for a twofold loss and overthrow, they
U||   set this unlucky mark upon it, that it should be reputed unmeet and
U||   unconvenient for any business, as well public as private.—Holland,
U||   Livy, p. 217.
U||   The particular calendars, wherein their [the Jews’] good or dismal days
U||   are distinguished, according to the diversity of their ways, we find,
U||   Leviticus 26.—Jackson, The Eternal Truth of Scriptures, b. i. c. 22.
U||   Disoblige. Release from obligation lies at the root of all uses,
U||   present and past, of this word; but it was formerly more the release
U||   from an oath or a duty, and now rather from the slighter debts of
U||   social life, to which kindness and courtesy on the part of another
U||   would have held us bound or ‘obliged;’ while the contraries to these
U||   are ‘disobliging.’
U||   He did not think that Act of Uniformity could disoblige them [the
U||   Non-Conformists] from the exercise of their office.—Bates, Mr. Richard
U||   Baxter’s Funeral Sermon.
U||   Many that are imprisoned for debt, think themselves disobliged from
U||   payment.—Bishop Taylor, Holy Dying, c. 5, § 3.
U||   He hath a very great obligation to do that and more; and he can noways
U||   be disobliged, but by the care of his natural relations.—Id., Measures
U||   and Offices of Friendship.
U||   Ditty. By the ‘ditty’ were once understood the words of a song as
U||   distinguished from the musical accompaniment.
U||   [Pg 83]
U||   They fell to challenge and defy one another, whereupon he commanded the
U||   musician Eraton to sing unto the harp, who began his song on this wise
U||   out of the works of Hesiodus:—
U||   Of quarrel and contention
U||   There were as then more sorts than one;
U||   for which I commended him in that he knew how to apply the ditty of his
U||   song so well unto the present time.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 786.
U||   So that, although we lay altogether aside the consideration of ditty or
U||   matter, the very harmony of sounds being framed in due sort, and
U||   carried by the ear to the spiritual faculties of the soul, is by a
U||   native puissance and efficacy greatly available to bring to a perfect
U||   temper whatsoever is there troubled.—Hooker, Ecclesiastical Polity, b.
U||   v. c. 38.
U||   Document. Now used only of the material, and not, as once, of the moral
U||   proof, evidence, or means of instruction.
U||   They were forthwith stoned to death, as a document unto others.—Sir W.
U||   Raleigh, History of the World, b. v. c. 2, § 3.
U||   This strange dejection of these three great apostles at so mild and
U||   gentle a voice [Matt. xvii. 6], gives us a remarkable document or
U||   grounded observation of the truth of that saying of St. Paul, Flesh and
U||   blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.—Jackson, Of the Primeval State
U||   of Man, b. ii. c. 12.
U||   It was a rare document of divine justice to ordain, and of divine
U||   wisdom so to contrive, that the dogs should lap King Ahab’s blood in
U||   the same place where they had lapped the blood of Naboth.—Id., Of the
U||   Divine Essence and Attributes, b. vi. ch. iii. 3.
U||   Dole. This and ‘deal’ are one and the same word, and answer to the
U||   German ‘Theil,’ a part or[Pg 84] portion.[287]14 It has now always the
U||   subaudition of a scanty portion, as ‘to dole’ is to deal scantily and
U||   reluctantly forth (‘pittance’ has acquired the same); but Sanderson’s
U||   use of ‘dole’ is instructive, as showing that ‘distribution or
U||   division’ is all which once lay in the word.
U||   There are certain common graces of illumination, and those indeed are
U||   given by dole, knowledge to one, to another tongues, to another
U||   healings; but it is nothing so with the special graces of
U||   sanctification. There is no distribution or division here; either all
U||   or none.—Sanderson, Sermons, 1671, vol. ii. p. 247.
U||   Draught. Many ‘draughts’ we still acknowledge, but not the ‘draught’ or
U||   drawing of a bow.
U||   A large draught up to his eare
U||   He drew, and with an arrow ground
U||   Sharpe and new, the queene a wound
U||   He gave.
U||   Chaucer, Dreame, 788.
U||   Then spake another proud one, Would to heaven
U||   I might at will get gold till he hath given
U||   That bow his draught.
U||   Chapman, The Odysseis of Homer, xxi. 533.
U||   Dreadful. Now that which causes dread, but once that which felt it. See
U||   ‘Frightful,’ ‘Hateful.’
U||   Forsothe the Lord shall gyve to thee there a dreedful herte and
U||   faylinge eyen.—Deut. xxviii. 65. Wiclif.
U||   And to a grove faste ther beside
U||   With dredful foot than stalketh Palamon.
U||   Chaucer, The Knightes Tale.
U||   [Pg 85]
U||   All mankind lo! that dreadful is to die,
U||   Thou dost constrain long death to learn by thee.
U||   Heywood, Translation of Seneca’s Hercules Furens.
U||   Thou art so set, as thou hast no cause to be
U||   Jealous, or dreadful of disloyalty.
U||   Daniel, Panegyric to the King.
U||   Dreary,     }
U||   Dreariness.
U||   This word has slightly shifted its meaning. In our earlier English it
U||   was used exactly as its German cognate ‘traurig’ is now, to designate
U||   the heaviness at once of countenance and of heart; very much the
U||   σκυθρωπός of the Greeks, though not admitting the subaudition of anger,
U||   which in that word is often contained. [Its Old English form was
U||   dréorig.]
U||   And the king seide to me, Whi is thi chere dreri, sithen I see thee not
U||   sick?—2 Esdras ii. 2. Wiclif.
U||   All drery was his chere and his loking.
U||   Chaucer, The Clerkes Tale, pt. 3.
U||   Bowe down to the pore thin ere withoute dreryness [sine tristitiâ,
U||   Vulg.]—Ecclus. iv. 8. Wiclif.
U||   Now es a man light, now es he hevy,
U||   Now es he blithe, now es he drery.
U||   Richard Rolle de Hampole, Pricke of Conscience, 1454.
U||   Drench. As ‘to fell’ is to make to fall, and ‘to lay’ to make to lie,
U||   so ‘to drench’ is to make to drink, though with a sense now very short
U||   of ‘to drown;’ but ‘drench’ and ‘drown,’ though desynonymized in our
U||   later English, were once perfectly adequate to one another.
U||   He is drenched in the flod,
U||   Abouten his hals an anker god.
U||   Havelok the Dane, 669.
U||   Thei that wolen be maad riche, fallen in to temptacioun, and in to
U||   snare of the devil, and in to many unprofitable[Pg 86] desiris and
U||   noyous, whiche drenchen men in to deth and perdicioun.—1 Tim. vi. 9.
U||   Wiclif.
U||   Well may men knowe it was no wyght but he
U||   That kepte peple Ebrayk fro hir drenching,
U||   With drye feet thurgh-out the see passing.
U||   Chaucer, The Man of Lawes Tale, 488 (Skeat).
U||   Drift. A drove of sheep or cattle was once a ‘drift;’ so too the act of
U||   driving.
U||   Hoc armentum, Anglice, a dryfte.—Wright-Wülcker, Vocab. 814. 11.
U||   By reason of the foulness and deepness of the way divers of the said
U||   sheep died in driving; partly for lack of meat and feeding, but
U||   especially by mean of the said unreasonable drift the said sheep are
U||   utterly perished.—Trevelyan Papers, p. 130.
U||   And Anton Shiel he loves me not,
U||   For I gat twa drifts of his sheep;
U||   The great Earl of Whitfield he loves me not,
U||   For nae gear fra me he could keep.
U||   Scotch Ballad.
U||   Duke. One of Shakespeare’s commentators charges him with an
U||   anachronism, the incongruous transfer of a modern title to an ancient
U||   condition of society, when he styles Theseus ‘Duke of Athens.’ It would
U||   be of very little consequence if the charge was a true one; but it is
U||   not, as his English Bible might have sufficiently taught him; Gen.
U||   xxxvi. 15-19. ‘Duke’ has indeed since Shakespeare’s time become that
U||   which this objector supposed it to have been always; but all were
U||   ‘dukes’ once who were ‘duces,’ captains and leaders of their people.
U||   He [St. Peter] techith christen men to be suget to kyngis and dukis,
U||   and to ech man for God.—Wiclif, Prologe on the first Pistel of Peter.
U||   [Pg 87]

U||   Chapman, Homer’s Iliad, b. ii.
U||   Dunce. I have sought elsewhere (Study of Words, 20th edit. p. 143) to
U||   trace at some length the curious history of this word. Sufficient here
U||   to say that Duns Scotus, whom Hooker styles ‘the wittiest of the school
U||   divines,’ has given us this name, which now ascribes hopeless
U||   ignorance, invincible stupidity, to him on whom it is affixed. The
U||   course by which this came to pass was as follows. When at the
U||   Reformation and Revival of Learning the works of the Schoolmen fell
U||   into extreme disfavour, alike with the Reformers and with the votaries
U||   of the new learning, Duns, a standard-bearer among those, was so often
U||   referred to with scorn and contempt by these, that his name gradually
U||   became that byeword which ever since it has been. See the quotation
U||   from Stanyhurst, s. v. ‘Trivial.’
U||   Remember ye not how within this thirty years, and far less, and yet
U||   dureth unto this day, the old barking curs, Dunce’s disciples, and like
U||   draff called Scotists, the children of darkness, raged in every pulpit
U||   against Greek, Latin, and Hebrew?—Tyndale, Works, 1575, p. 278.
U||   We have set Dunce in Bocardo and have utterly banished him Oxford for
U||   ever with all his blind glosses.... The second time we came to New
U||   College after we had declared your injunctions, we found all the great
U||   Quadrant Court full of the leaves of Dunce, the wind blowing them in
U||   every corner.—Wood’s Annals, A.D. 1535, 62.
U||   What Dunce or Sorbonist cannot maintain a paradox?—G. Harvey, Pierce’s
U||   Supererogation, p. 159.
U||   As for terms of honesty or civility, they are gibberish[Pg 88] unto

U||   Maud. Is this your tutor?
U||   Tutor. Yes surely, lady;

U||   And read the Dunces to him.
U||   Middleton, A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   Dutch,    }
U||   Dutchman.
U||   Till late in the seventeenth century ‘Dutch’ (‘deutsch,’ lit. belonging
U||   to the people) meant generally ‘German,’ and a ‘Dutchman’ a native of
U||   Germany, while what we now term a Dutchman was then a Hollander. In
U||   America this with so many other usages is retained, and Germans are now
U||   often called ‘Dutchmen’ there.
U||   Though the root of the English language be Dutch, yet she may be said
U||   to have been inoculated afterwards upon a French stock.—Howell, Lexicon
U||   Tetraglotton, Preface.
U||   Germany is slandered to have sent none to this war [the Crusades] at
U||   this first voyage; and that other pilgrims, passing through that
U||   country, were mocked by the Dutch, and called fools for their
U||   pains.—Fuller, Holy War, b. i. c. 13.
U||   At the same time began the Teutonic Order, consisting only of Dutchmen,
U||   well descended.—Id. ib. b. ii. c. 16.
U||   Eager,     }
U||   Eagerness.
U||   The physical and literal sense of ‘eager,’ that is, sharp or acrid (Fr.
U||   aigre, Lat. acrem), has quite departed from the word. It occasionally
U||   retained this, long after it was employed in the secondary meaning
U||   which is its only one at present.

U||   That ladde hir lyf oonly by breed

U||   (A.D. 1611).
U||   Ebb. Nothing ‘ebbs,’ unless it is figuratively, except water now. But
U||   ‘ebb,’ oftenest an adjective, was continually used in our earlier
U||   English with a general meaning of shallow. There is still a Lancashire
U||   proverb, ‘Cross the stream where it is ebbest.’
U||   Orpiment, a mineral digged out of the ground in Syria, where it lieth
U||   very ebb.—Holland, Pliny, vol. ii. p. 469.
U||   This you may observe ordinarily in stones, that those parts and sides
U||   which lie covered deeper within the ground be more frim and tender, as
U||   being preserved by heat, than those outward faces which lie ebb, or
U||   above the earth.—Id., Plutarch’s Morals, p. 747.
U||   It is all one whether I be drowned in the ebber shore, or in the midst
U||   of the deep sea.—Bishop Hall, Meditations and Vows, cent. ii.
U||   Ecstasy. We still say of madmen that they are beside themselves; but
U||   ‘ecstasy,’ or a standing out of oneself, is no longer used as an
U||   equivalent to madness.
U||   This is the very coinage of your brain;
U||   This bodiless creation ecstasy
U||   Is very cunning in.
U||   Shakespeare, Hamlet, act iii. sc. 4.
U||   Edify. ‘From the Christian Church being called the temple or house of
U||   God, this word acquired a metaphorical and spiritual meaning, and is
U||   applied[Pg 90] in the N. T. and in modern language to mental or
U||   spiritual advancement. Old English writers used it in its original
U||   sense of build’ (Bible Word Book). For some quotations which mark the
U||   coming up of the secondary or metaphorical meaning see my English Past
U||   and Present, 14th edit. p. 186.

U||   Elder. The German ‘eltern’ still signifies parents; as ‘elders’ did
U||   once with us, though now the word has quite let this meaning go.
U||   And hise disciplis axiden hym, Maistir, what synnede, this man or hise
U||   eldris, that he schulde be borun blynd?—John ix. 2. Wiclif.[Pg 91]

U||   For aye from Eden, earthly type of heaven,
U||   Lie languishing near Tigris’ grassy side.
U||   Sylvester, Du Bartas, The Handycrafts.
U||   Element. The air, as that among the four elements which is most present
U||   everywhere, was frequently ‘the element’ in our earlier literature.
U||   When Pompey saw the dust in the element, and conjectured the flying of
U||   his horsemen, what mind he was of then it was hard to say.—North,
U||   Plutarch’s Lives, p. 553.
U||   The face therefore of the element you have skill to discern, and the
U||   signs of times can you not?—Matt. xvi. 3. Rheims.
U||   There is no stir or walking in the streets,
U||   And the complexion of the element
U||   In favour is like the work we have in hand,
U||   Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
U||   Shakespeare, Julius Cæsar, act i. sc. 3.
U||   I took it for a faery vision
U||   Of some gay creatures of the element,
U||   That in the colours of the rainbow live,
U||   And play in the plighted clouds.
U||   Milton, Comus, 298.
U||   Elephant. I have little doubt that ‘elephant’ as an equivalent for
U||   ivory is a Grecism not peculiar to Chapman, in whose translations from
U||   Homer it several times occurs; but I cannot adduce an example from any
U||   other. The use of ‘olifant’ in this sense is quite common in the older
U||   French (see Didot’s Glossary in Ducange, ed. 1887).
U||   [Pg 92]
U||   I did last afford
U||   The varied ornament, which showed no want
U||   Of silver, gold, and polished elephant.
U||   Chapman, The Odysseis of Homer, b. xxiii. l. 306.
U||   Elevate. There are two intentions with which anything may be lifted
U||   from the place which it occupies; either with that of setting it in a
U||   more conspicuous position; or else of removing it out of the way, or,
U||   figuratively, of withdrawing all importance and significance from it.
U||   We employ ‘to elevate’ now in the former intention; our ancestors for
U||   the most part, especially those whose style was influenced by their
U||   Latin studies, in the latter.
U||   Withal, he forgat not to elevate as much as he could the fame of the
U||   foresaid unhappy field fought, saying, That if all had been true, there
U||   would have been messengers coming thick one after another upon their
U||   flight to bring fresh tidings still thereof.—Holland, Livy, p. 1199.
U||   Audience he had with great assent and applause; not more for elevating
U||   the fault and trespass of the common people, than for laying the weight
U||   upon those that were the authors culpable.—Id., ib. p. 1207.
U||   Tully in his oration Pro Flacco, to elevate or lessen that conceit
U||   which many Romans had of the nation of the Jews, objects little less
U||   unto them than our Saviour in this place doth, to wit that they were in
U||   bondage to the Romans.—Jackson, Of the Primeval Estate of Man, b. x. c.
U||   14.
U||   Embezzle. A man can now only ‘embezzle’ another man’s property; he
U||   might once ‘embezzle’ his own. Thus, while we might now say that the
U||   Unjust Steward ‘embezzled’ his lord’s goods (Luke xvi. 1), we could not
U||   say that the Prodigal Son ‘embezzled’ the portion which he had received
U||   from[Pg 93] his father, and which had thus become his own (Luke xv.
U||   13); but the one would have been as free to our early writers as the
U||   other. There is a form, ‘to imbecile,’ used by Jeremy Taylor and
U||   others, which has the same meaning as this word.
U||   Mr. Hackluit died, leaving a fair estate to an unthrift son, who
U||   embezzled it.—Fuller, Worthies of England: Herefordshire.
U||   The collection of these various readings [is] a testimony even of the
U||   faithfulness of these later ages of the Church, and of the high
U||   reverence they had of these records, in that they would not so much as
U||   embesell the various readings of them, but keep them still on foot for
U||   the prudent to judge of.—H. More, Grand Mystery of Godliness, b. vii.
U||   c. 11.
U||   If we are ambitious of having a property in somewhat, or affect to call
U||   anything our own, ’tis only by nobly giving that we can accomplish our
U||   desire; that will certainly appropriate our goods to our use and
U||   benefit; but from basely keeping or vainly embezzling them, they become
U||   not our possession and enjoyment, but our theft and our bane.—Barrow,
U||   The Duty and Reward of Bounty to the Poor.
U||   Be not prodigal of your time on earth, which is so little in your
U||   power. ’Tis so precious a thing that it is to be redeemed; ’tis
U||   therefore too precious to be embezzled and trifled away.—Howe, The
U||   Redeemer’s Dominion over the Invisible World.
U||   Emulation. South in one of his sermons has said excellently well, ‘We
U||   ought by all means to note the difference between envy and emulation;
U||   which latter is a brave and noble thing, and quite of another nature,
U||   as consisting only in a generous imitation of something excellent; and
U||   that such an imitation as scorns to fall short of its copy, but strives
U||   if possible to outdo it. The emulator is impatient of a superior, not
U||   by depressing or maligning another but by perfecting[Pg 94] himself. So
U||   that while that sottish thing envy sometimes fills the whole soul, as a
U||   great fog does the air: this on the contrary inspires it with a new
U||   life and vigour, whets and stirs up all the powers of it to action.’
U||   But ‘emulation,’ though sometimes used by our early writers in this
U||   nobler sense, to express an honourable and generous rivalry, was by no
U||   means always so; it was often an exact equivalent to envy.
U||   Zeal to promote the common good is welcomed with suspicion instead of
U||   love, and with emulation instead of thanks.—The Translators’ Preface to
U||   the Authorized Version.
U||   So every step,
U||   Exampled by the first step that is sick
U||   Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
U||   Of pale and bloodless emulation.
U||   Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, act i. sc. 3.
U||   And the patriarchs through emulation [moved with envy, A.V.] sold
U||   Joseph into Egypt.—Acts vii. 9. Rheims.
U||   Endeavour. This, connected with ‘devoir,’ is used as a reflexive verb
U||   in our version of the New Testament and in the Prayer Book. Signifying
U||   now no more than to try, it signified once to bend all our energies,
U||   not to the attempt at fulfilling, but to the actual fulfilment of a
U||   duty. The force of such passages as Ephes. iv. 3, ‘endeavouring to keep
U||   the unity of the Spirit,’ is greatly weakened by giving to ‘endeavour’
U||   its modern sense. Attaching to it this, we may too easily persuade
U||   ourselves that the Apostle does no more than bid us to attempt to
U||   preserve this unity, and that he quite recognizes the possibility of
U||   our being defeated in this attempt.
U||   [Pg 95]
U||   This is called in Scripture ‘a just man,’ that endeavoureth himself to
U||   leave all wickedness.—Latimer, Sermons, p. 340.
U||   One thing I do, I forget that which is behind, and endevour myself into
U||   that which is before.—Phil. iii. 13. Geneva.
U||   Engrave. This word has now quite lost the sense of ‘to bury,’ which it
U||   once possessed. See ‘Grave.’
U||   So both agree their bodies to engrave;
U||   The great earthes womb they open to the sky; ...
U||   They lay therein those corses tenderly.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, ii. 1, 60.
U||   And now with happy wish he closely craved
U||   For ever to be dead, to be so sweet ingraved.
U||   Britain’s Ida, iv. 2.
U||   Thou death of death, oh! in thy death engrave me.
U||   Phineas Fletcher, Poetical Miscellanies.
U||   Enjoy. Not, when Wiclif wrote, nor till some time later, distinguished
U||   from ‘rejoice,’ which see.
U||   And the pees of Crist enioye [pax Christi exsultet, Vulgate] in youre
U||   hertis.—Col. iii. 15. Wiclif.
U||   Enormous, }
U||   Enormity.
U||   Now only applied to that which is irregular in excess, in this way
U||   transcending the established norm or rule. But departure from rule or
U||   irregularity in any direction might be characterised as ‘enormous’
U||   once.
U||   O great corrector of enormous times,
U||   Shaker of o’er-rank states, thou grand decider
U||   Of dusty and old titles, that heal’st with blood
U||   The earth when it is sick.
U||   Beaumont and Fletcher, The Two Noble
U||   [Pg 96]Kinsmen, act v. sc. 1.
U||   Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, v. 297.
U||   Pyramids, arches, obelisks, were but the irregularities of vain-glory,
U||   and wild enormities of ancient magnanimity.—Sir T. Browne,
U||   Hydriotaphia.
U||   Ensure. None of our Dictionaries, as far as I can observe, have taken
U||   notice of an old use of this word, namely, to betroth, and thus to make
U||   sure the future husband and wife to each other. See ‘Assure,’ ‘Sure.’
U||   After his mother Mary was ensured to Joseph, before they were coupled
U||   together, it was perceived she was with child.—Matt. i. 18. Sir John
U||   Cheke.
U||   Albeit that she was by the king’s mother and many other put in good
U||   comfort to affirm that she was ensured unto the king; yet when she was
U||   solemnly sworn to say the truth, she confessed that they were never
U||   ensured.—Sir T. More, History of King Richard III.
U||   Epicure. Now applied only to those who devote themselves, yet with a
U||   certain elegance and refinement, to the pleasures of the table;
U||   ‘gourmets’ rather than ‘gourmands.’ We may trace two earlier stages in
U||   its meaning. By Lord Bacon and others the followers of Epicurus, whom
U||   we should call Epicureans, are often called ‘Epicures,’ after the name
U||   of the founder of their sect. From them it was transferred to all who
U||   were, like them, deniers of a divine Providence; and this is the common
U||   use of it by our elder divines. But inasmuch as those who have
U||   persuaded themselves that there is nothing above them, will seek their
U||   good, since men must seek it somewhere, in the things beneath them, in
U||   sensual delights, the name has been[Pg 97] transferred, by that true
U||   moral instinct which is continually at work in speech, from the
U||   philosophical speculative atheist to the human swine for whom the world
U||   is but a feeding-trough.
U||   So the Epicures say of the Stoics’ felicity placed in virtue, that it
U||   is like the felicity of a player, who if he were left of his auditors
U||   and their applause, he would straight be out of heart and
U||   countenance.—Bacon, Colours of Good and Evil, 3.
U||   Aristotle is altogether an Epicure; he holdeth that God careth nothing
U||   for human creatures; he allegeth God ruleth the world like as a sleepy
U||   maid rocketh a child.—Luther, Table-Talk, c. 73.
U||   The Epicure grants there is a God, but denies his providence.—Sydenham,
U||   The Athenian Babbler, 1627, p. 7.
U||   Equal. The ethical sense of ‘equal,’ as fair, candid, just, has almost,
U||   if not altogether, departed from it. Compare ‘Unequal.’
U||   O my most equal hearers, if these deeds
U||   May pass with suffrance, what one citizen
U||   But owes the forfeit of his life, yea, fame,
U||   To him that dares traduce him?
U||   Ben Jonson, The Fox, act iv. sc. 2.
U||   Hear now, O house of Israel; is not my way equal? are not your ways
U||   unequal?—Ezek. xviii. 25. (A. V.)
U||   Equivocal,    }
U||   Equivocally,
U||   Equivocation.
U||   The calling two or more different things by one and the same name (æque
U||   vocare) is the source of almost all error in human discourse. He who
U||   wishes to throw dust in the eyes of an opponent, to hinder his arriving
U||   at the real facts of a case, will often have recourse to this artifice,
U||   and thus ‘to equivocate’ and[Pg 98] ‘equivocation’ have attained their
U||   present secondary meaning, very different from their original, which
U||   was simply the calling of two or more different things by one and the
U||   same word.
U||   This visible world is but a picture of the invisible, wherein as in a
U||   portrait, things are not truly, but in equivocal shapes, and as they
U||   counterfeit some real substance in that invisible fabric.—Sir T.
U||   Browne, Religio Medici.
U||   Which [courage and constancy] he that wanteth is no other than
U||   equivocally a gentleman, as an image or a carcass is a man.—Barrow,
U||   Sermon on Industry in our several Callings.
U||   He [the good herald] knows when indeed the names are the same, though
U||   altered through variety of writing in various ages; and where the
U||   equivocation is untruly affected.—Fuller, The Holy State, b. ii. c. 22.
U||   All words, being arbitrary signs, are ambiguous; and few disputers have
U||   the jealousy and skill which is necessary to discuss equivocations; and
U||   so take verbal differences for material.—Baxter, Catholic Theology,
U||   Preface.
U||   Err,   }
U||   Error.
U||   ‘To err’ is still to wander; but it is now used always in a figurative
U||   and ethical sense, to deviate morally from the right way. In my first
U||   quotation from Chapman, it is Telemachus who speaks, and of course
U||   Ulysses of whom he speaks.
U||   To thy knees therefore I am come, to attend
U||   Relation of the sad and wretched end
U||   My erring father felt.
U||   Chapman, Homer’s Odysseis, b. iv. 435.
U||   Even he is error-driven,
U||   If yet he lives, and sees the light of heaven.
U||   Id., ib. xx. 323.
U||   The extravagant and erring spirit hies
U||   To his confine.
U||   Shakespeare, Hamlet, act i. sc. 1.
U||   [Pg 99]
U||   The characters of signs and erring stars.
U||   Marlowe, Faustus, sc. 3.
U||   Essay. There is no particular modesty now in calling a treatise or
U||   dissertation an ‘essay;’ but from many passages it is plain that there
U||   was so once; which indeed is only agreeable to the proper meaning of
U||   the word, an ‘essay’ being a trial, proof, specimen, taste of a thing,
U||   rather than the very and completed thing itself.
U||   To write just treatises requireth leisure in the writer, and leisure in
U||   the reader; and therefore are not so fit neither in regard of your
U||   highness’ princely affairs, nor in regard of my continual service;
U||   which is the cause which hath made me choose to write certain brief
U||   notes, set down rather significantly than curiously, which I have
U||   called Essays. The word is late, but the thing is ancient.—Bacon,
U||   Intended Dedication of his Essays to Prince Henry.
U||   Yet modestly he does his work survey,
U||   And calls a finished poem an essay.
U||   Dryden, Epistle 5, To the Earl of Roscommon.
U||   Exemplary. A certain vagueness in our use of ‘exemplary’ makes it for
U||   us little more than a loose synonym for excellent. We plainly often
U||   forget that ‘exemplary’ is strictly that which serves, or might serve,
U||   for an exemplar to others, while only through keeping this distinctly
U||   before us will passages like the following yield their exact meaning to
U||   us.
U||   We are not of opinion, therefore, as some are, that nature in working
U||   hath before her certain exemplary draughts or patterns.—Hooker,
U||   Ecclesiastical Polity, b. i. c. 3.
U||   When the English, at the Spanish fleet’s approach in eighty-eight
U||   [1588], drew their ships out of Plymouth haven, the Lord Admiral Howard
U||   himself towed a cable, the least[Pg 100] joint of whose exemplary hand
U||   drew more than twenty men besides.—Fuller, The Holy State, b. iv. c.
U||   17.
U||   Exemplify. The use of ‘exemplify’ in the sense of the Greek
U||   παραδειγματίζειν (Matt. i. 19) has now passed away. Observe also in the
U||   passage quoted the curious use of ‘traduce.’
U||   He is a just and jealous God, not sparing to exemplify and traduce his
U||   best servants [i.e. when they sin], that their blur and penalty might
U||   scare all from venturing.—Rogers, Matrimonial Honour, p. 337.
U||   Explode. All our present uses of ‘explode,’ whether literal or
U||   figurative, have reference to bursting, and to bursting with noise; and
U||   it is for the most part forgotten that these are all secondary and
U||   derived; that ‘to explode,’ originally an active verb, means to drive
U||   off the stage with loud clappings of the hands: and that when one of
U||   our early writers speaks of an ‘exploded’ heresy, or an ‘exploded’
U||   opinion, his image is not drawn from something which, having burst, has
U||   so perished; but he would imply that it has been contemptuously driven
U||   off from the world’s stage—the fact that ‘explosion’ in this earlier
U||   sense was with a great noise being the connecting link between that
U||   sense and our present.
U||   A third sort explode this opinion as trespassing on Divine
U||   Providence.—Fuller, Holy War, b. iii. c. 18.
U||   A man may with more facility avoid him that circumvents by money than
U||   him that deceives with glosing terms, which made Socrates so much abhor
U||   and explode them.—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy; Democritus to the
U||   Reader.
U||   Thus was the applause they meant
U||   Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame,
U||   Cast on themselves from their own mouths.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, x. 545; cf. xi. 699.
U||   [Pg 101]
U||   Shall that man pass for a proficient in Christ’s school, who would have
U||   been exploded in the school of Zeno or Epictetus?—South, Sermons, vol.
U||   i. p. 431.
U||   Exterminate,   }
U||   Extermination.
U||   This now signifies to destroy, to abolish; but our fathers, more true
U||   to the etymology, understood by it to drive men out of and beyond their
U||   own borders.
U||   Most things do either associate and draw near to themselves the like,
U||   and do also drive away, chase, and exterminate their contraries.—Bacon,
U||   Colours of Good and Evil, 7.
U||   We believe it to be the general interest of us all, as much as in us
U||   lies, with our common aid and succour to relieve our exterminated and
U||   indigent brethren.—Milton, Letter written in Cromwell’s name on
U||   occasion of the persecutions of the Vaudois.
U||   The state of the Jews was in that depression, in that conculcation, in
U||   that consternation, in that extermination in the captivity of
U||   Babylon.—Donne, Sermons, 19.
U||   Facetious,     }
U||   Facetiousness.
U||   It is certainly not a little remarkable that alike in Greek, Latin, and
U||   English, words expressive of witty festive conversation should have
U||   degenerated, though not all exactly in the same direction, and
U||   gradually acquired a worse signification than that with which they
U||   began; I mean εὐτραπελία, ‘urbanitas,’ and our own ‘facetiousness;’
U||   this degeneracy of the words warning us how easily the thing itself
U||   degenerates: how sure it is to do so, to corrupt and spoil, if it be
U||   not seasoned with the only salt which will hinder this. ‘Facetiousness’
U||   has already acquired the sense of buffoonery, of the making of ignoble
U||   mirth for others; there are plain indications that it will ere long
U||   acquire the sense of indecent buffoonery: while there was a time, as
U||   the examples[Pg 102] given below will prove, when it could be ascribed
U||   in praise to high-bred ladies of the court and to grave prelates and
U||   divines.
U||   He [Archbishop Williams] demonstrated that his mind was the lighter,
U||   because his friends were about him, and his facetious wit was true to
U||   him at those seasons, because his heart was true to his
U||   company.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part ii. p. 32.
U||   A grave man, yet without moroseness, as who would willingly contribute
U||   his shot of facetiousness on any just occasion.—Fuller, Worthies of
U||   England: Oxfordshire.
U||   The king easily took notice of her [Anne Boleyn]; whether more
U||   captivated by the allurements of her beauty, or the facetiousness of
U||   her behaviour, it is hard to say.—Heylin, History of Queen Mary,
U||   Introduction.
U||   Fact. This and ‘act’ or ‘deed’ have been usefully desynonymized. An
U||   ‘act’ or ‘deed’ implies now always a person as the actor or doer; but
U||   it is sufficient for a ‘fact’ that it exists, that it has been done,
U||   the author or doer of it falling altogether out of sight.
U||   All the world is witnesse agaynst you, yea, and also your owne factes
U||   and deedes.—Barnes, Works, 1572, p. 251.
U||   But, when the furious fit was overpast,
U||   His cruel facts he often would repent.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, 1, iv. 34.
U||   Icetes took but a few of them to serve his turn, as if he had been
U||   ashamed of his fact, and had used their friendship by stealth.—North,
U||   Plutarch’s Lives, 1656, p. 228.
U||   Fairy. In whatever latitude we may employ ‘fairy’ now, this Romance
U||   word is generally restricted to the middle beings of Teutonic and
U||   Romanic popular[Pg 103] mythology; being in no case applied, as it used
U||   to be, to the δαίμονες of classical antiquity.
U||   Of the fairy Manto [daughter of Tiresias] I cannot affirm any thing of
U||   truth, whether she were a fairy or a prophetess.—Sir J. Harington,
U||   Orlando Furioso, b. lxiii.
U||   So long as these wise fairies Μοῖρα and Λάχεσις, that is to say Portion
U||   and Partition, had the ordering of suppers, dinners, and great feasts,
U||   a man should never see any illiberal or mechanical disorder.—Holland,
U||   Plutarch’s Morals, p. 679.
U||   Fame. This is now generally applied to the reputation derived from the
U||   report of great actions, but was constantly used in our Authorized
U||   Version (Gen. xlv. 16; 1 Kin. x. 7; Jer. vi. 24; Matt. ix. 26), and in
U||   contemporary writings, as equivalent to report alone. Compare the
U||   distinction in Quintilian (v. 3) between ‘fama’ and ‘rumor.’
U||   The occasion which Pharaoh took to murder all the Hebrew males was from
U||   a constant fame or prenotion that about this time there should a Hebrew
U||   male be born that should work wonders for the good of his
U||   people.—Jackson, Christ’s Everlasting Priesthood, b. x. c. xl.
U||   And his fame [ἡ ἀκοὴ αὐτοῦ] went throughout all Syria.—Matt. iv. 24.
U||   (A. V.)
U||   Family. It is not a good sign that the ‘family’ has now ceased to
U||   include the servants; but for a long while the word retained the
U||   largeness of its classical use, indeed it has only very recently lost
U||   it altogether.
U||   The same care is to extend to all of our family, in their proportions,
U||   as to our children: for as by S. Paul’s reasoning the heir differs
U||   nothing from a servant while he is in minority, so a servant should
U||   differ nothing from a child in the[Pg 104] substantial part of the
U||   care.—Bishop Taylor, Holy Living, 3, 2.
U||   He [Sir Matthew Hale] kept no greater a family than myself.—Baxter,
U||   Life, part 3, § 107.
U||   A just master may have an unconscionable servant; and if he have a
U||   numerous family and keep many, it is a rare thing if he have not some
U||   bad.—Sanderson, Sermons, 1671, vol. i. p. 115.
U||   To join to wife good family,
U||   And none to keep for bravery ...
U||   These be the steps unfeignedly
U||   To climb to thrift by husbandry.
U||   Tusser, Hundred Points of Good Husbandry, 9.
U||   Fancy. The distinction between ‘fancy’ and ‘imagination,’ for which
U||   Wordsworth so earnestly contended, has obtained full recognition. It
U||   was the more easy for it to find acceptance from the fact that it fell
U||   in with a certain clinamen, a disposition already obscurely working in
U||   the minds of men, to ascribe different domains of meaning to these
U||   several words. But while what has been thus done has been well done, it
U||   would be a mistake to regard this as an old distinction that was now
U||   recovered from the oblivion into which it had fallen. The Greeks
U||   ascribed no such subordination of φαντασία (‘phantasy,’ ‘phansy,’
U||   ‘fancy’) to some other word, as we now ascribe to ‘fancy’ in its
U||   relation to ‘imagination.’ Φαντασία was for Plato and Aristotle (see
U||   too Longinus, c. 15), all that ‘imagination’ is for us, the power which
U||   summons up before the mind’s eye of the poet, and of as many as he can
U||   carry along with him, the forms of things not present, shaping and
U||   moulding, dissolving and reuniting and fusing these at his will; while
U||   ‘fancy,’ as we now understand the word, with the[Pg 105] humbler
U||   offices assigned to it, as the aggregative and associated power, more
U||   playful but less earnest, dealing often in prettinesses rather than in
U||   beauties, had not obtained any special word to express it. At the
U||   Revival of Learning both words found themselves in our English
U||   vocabulary; but far down into the seventeenth century there was no
U||   sense of any distinction between them; they were simply duplicates, one
U||   from the Greek and one from the Latin. They are constantly employed by
U||   Henry More as absolutely convertible; and where Milton makes any
U||   difference between them, it is to the advantage of ‘fancy,’ which
U||   includes ‘imagination’ as a greater includes a less. At a later day it
U||   was felt to be a waste of wealth to have two words absolutely identical
U||   in meaning for one and the same mental operation; above all, while
U||   another went without any to designate it at all; and thus the instinct
U||   which is ever at work in a language for the making the most of its
U||   resources began to work for the desynonymizing of ‘imagination’ and
U||   ‘fancy.’ This could only be effected by the coming down of one or the
U||   other from its height of place. The lot naturally fell on ‘fancy,’ the
U||   grand φαντάζεσθαι, on which it rested, being far more obscured to such
U||   as were not scholars, than the Latin ‘imago,’ on which ‘imagination’
U||   reposed.
U||   Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
U||   Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend
U||   More than cool reason ever comprehends.
U||   Shakespeare, Midsummer Night’s Dream, act v. sc. 1.
U||   In the soul
U||   Are many lesser faculties that serve
U||   Reason as chief; among them Fancy next
U||   Her office holds; of all external things
U||   Which the five watchful senses represent [Pg 106]
U||   She forms imaginations, airy shapes.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, v. 300.
U||   The devil can act upon the soul by suggesting the ideas and spiritual
U||   pictures of things to the imagination. For this is the grand repository
U||   of all the ideas and representations which the mind of man can work
U||   either upon or by. So that Satan, our skilful artist, can as easily
U||   slide his injections into the fancy as present a deluding image to the
U||   eye.—South, Sermons, 1737, vol. i. p. 110.
U||   Fastidious. Persons are ‘fastidious’ now, as feeling disgust; things,
U||   and indeed persons too, were ‘fastidious’ once, as occasioning disgust.
U||   The word has shifted from an objective to a subjective use.
U||   ‘Fastidiosus’ had both uses, but our modern quite predominated; indeed
U||   the other is very rare.
U||   That thing for the which children be oftentimes beaten, is to them ever
U||   after fastidious.—Sir T. Elyot, The Governor, b. i. c. 9.
U||   Feature. This, the Old French ‘faiture,’ Latin ‘factura,’ is always the
U||   part now of a larger whole, a ‘feature’ of the landscape, the
U||   ‘features’ of the face; but there was no such limitation once; anything
U||   made, any ‘fattura,’ was a ‘feature’ once. ‘Facies’ in Latin, according
U||   to Aulus Gellius (xiii. 29), underwent a not very dissimilar change of
U||   meaning. In addition to the examples which follow, see Spenser, Fairy
U||   Queen, iv. 2, 44; iii. 9, 21.
U||   A body so harmoniously composed,
U||   As if nature disclosed
U||   All her best symmetry in that one feature.
U||   Ben Jonson, The Forest, xi.
U||   We have not yet found them all [the scattered limbs of Truth], nor ever
U||   shall do, till her Master’s second coming;[Pg 107] He shall bring
U||   together every joint and member, and shall mould them into an immortal
U||   feature of loveliness and perfection.—Milton, Areopagitica.
U||   So scented the grim feature, and upturned
U||   His nostril wide into the murky air.
U||   Id. Paradise Lost, x. 278.
U||   But this young feature [a commentary on Scripture which Archbishop
U||   Williams had planned], like an imperfect embryo, was mortified in the
U||   womb by Star-chamber vexations.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams,
U||   part ii. p. 40.
U||   Feminine. The distinction between ‘feminine’ and ‘effeminate,’ that the
U||   first is ‘womanly,’ the second ‘womanish,’ the first what becomes a
U||   woman, and under certain limitations may without reproach be affirmed
U||   of a man, while the second under all circumstances dishonours a man, as
U||   ‘mannish’ would dishonour a woman, is of comparatively modern growth.
U||   Neither could ‘feminine’ now be used as an antithesis of ‘male,’ as by
U||   Milton (Paradise Lost, i. 423) it is.
U||   Till at the last God of veray right
U||   Displeased was with his condiciouns,
U||   By cause he [Sardanapalus] was in every mannes sight
U||   So femynyne in his affectiouns.
U||   Lydgate, Poem against Idleness.
U||   But Ninias being esteemed no man of war at all, but altogether
U||   feminine, and subject to ease and delicacy, there is no probability in
U||   that opinion.—Sir W. Raleigh, History of the World, b. ii. c 1, § 1.
U||   Commodus, the wanton and feminine son of wise Antoninus, gave a check
U||   to the great name of his father.—Bishop Taylor, Apples of Sodom.
U||   Firmament. We now use ‘firmament’ only for that portion of the sky on
U||   all sides visible above the[Pg 108] horizon, having gotten this
U||   application of the word from the Vulgate (Gen. i. 6), or at any rate
U||   from the Church Latin (‘firmamentum cæleste,’ Tertullian, De Bapt. 3),
U||   as that had derived it from the Septuagint. This by στερέωμα had sought
U||   to express the firmness and stability of the sky-tent, which
U||   phenomenally (and Scripture for the most part speaks phenomenally) is
U||   drawn over the earth; and to reproduce the force of the original Hebrew
U||   word,—in which, however, there is rather the notion of expansion than
U||   of firmness (see H. More, Defence of Cabbala, p. 60). But besides this
U||   use of ‘firmament,’ totally strange to the classical ‘firmamentum,’
U||   being derived to us from the ecclesiastical employment of the word,
U||   there is also an occasional use of it by the scholarly writers of the
U||   seventeenth century in the original classical sense, as that which
U||   makes strong or confirms.
U||   I thought it good to make a strong head or bank to rule and guide the
U||   course of the waters; by setting down this position or firmament,
U||   namely, that all knowledge is to be limited by religion, and to be
U||   referred to use and action.—Bacon, Of the Interpretation of Nature.
U||   Religion is the ligature of all communities, and the firmament of
U||   laws.—Bishop Taylor, Ductor Dubitantium, iii. 3, 8.
U||   Flicker. This, with its variant ‘flacker,’ can only be used now of the
U||   wavering motion of flames; but it was not so once.
U||   But being made a swan,
U||   With snowy feathers in the air to flicker he began.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. vii.
U||   And the Cherubins flackered with their wings, and lift themselves up
U||   from the earth.—Ezek. x. 19. Coverdale.
U||   [Pg 109]
U||   Flirt. This, or ‘flurt,’ as it used to be spelt, is a slightly
U||   contracted form of the French ‘fleureter,’ from ‘fleur,’ a flower, to
U||   flirt meaning to go as a bee from flower to flower, daintily sipping
U||   the sweets of one flower, and then passing on to another (see
U||   Cotgrave). At the same time much graver charges came to be often
U||   implied in the word than are implied at the present. See on it A. S.
U||   Palmer’s Leaves from a Word-hunter’s Note Book, pp. 33-40.
U||   For why may not the mother be naught, a peevish, drunken flurt, a
U||   waspish choleric slut, a crazed piece, a fool, as soon as the
U||   nurse?—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy, part i. sect. 2.
U||   Gadrouillette, f. A minx, gigle, flirt, callet, Gixie; (a feigned word,
U||   appliable to any such cattell).—Cotgrave, A French and English
U||   Dictionary, ed. 1673.
U||   Flounce. This word, meaning ‘to plunge about,’ must not be confused
U||   with ‘flounce’ (a part of a dress); see Skeat’s Dictionary.
U||   After an exhortation to his army, he [the Emperor Conrad] commanded
U||   them all at once to flounce into the river.—Fuller, Holy War, b. ii. c.
U||   28.
U||   Launch now into the whirlpool, or rather flounce into the mud and
U||   quagmire.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, vol. ii. p. 200.
U||   Fondling. ‘Fond’ retains to this day, at least in poetry, not seldom
U||   the sense of foolish; but a ‘fondling’ is no longer a fool.
U||   An epicure hath some reason to allege, an extortioner is a man of
U||   wisdom, and acteth prudently in comparison to him; but this fondling
U||   [the profane swearer] offendeth heaven and abandoneth happiness he
U||   knoweth not why or for what.—Barrow, Sermon 15.
U||   [Pg 110]
U||   We have many such fondlings, that are their wives’ pack-horses and
U||   slaves.—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy, part iii. sect. 3.
U||   Forgetful. Exactly the converse of what has happened to ‘dreadful’ and
U||   ‘frightful’ (which see) has befallen ‘forgetful.’
U||   It may be the forgetful wine begot
U||   Some sudden blow, and thereupon this challenge.
U||   Webster, A Cure for a Cuckold, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   If the sleepy drench
U||   Of that forgetful lake benumb not still.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, ii. 73.
U||   Forlorn,      }
U||   Forlorn Hope.
U||   There are two points of difference between the past use of ‘forlorn
U||   hope’ and the present. The first, that it was seldom used,—I can recall
U||   no single example,—in that which is now its only application, namely,
U||   of those who, being the first to mount the breach, thus set their lives
U||   upon a desperate hazard; but always of the skirmishers and others
U||   thrown out in front of an army about to engage. Here, indeed, the
U||   central notion of the word may be affirmed to agree with that it has
U||   now. These first come to hand-strokes with the enemy; they bear the
U||   brunt of their onset; with less likelihood therefore that they will
U||   escape than those who come after. This is quite true, and it comes
U||   remarkably out in my first quotation from Holland; just as in a retreat
U||   they are the ‘forlorn hope’ (Swedish Intelligencer, vol. i. p. 163),
U||   who bring up the rear. But in passages innumerable this of the greater
U||   hazard to which the ‘forlorn hope’ are exposed, has quite disappeared,
U||   and the ‘forlorn’ (for ‘hope’ is often omitted) are simply that part of
U||   the[Pg 111] army which, being posted in the front, is first engaged.
U||   The phrase is an importation from Holland, and ‘hope’ is the Dutch
U||   ‘hoop,’ a heap, band, troop. I find it first in Gascoigne’s Fruits of
U||   War, st. 74.
U||   The fearful are in the forlorn [see Rev. xxi. 8] of those that march
U||   for hell.—Gurnall, The Christian in Complete Armour, c. 1.
U||   They [the Enniskillen horse] offered with spirit to make always the
U||   forlorn of the army.—Dryden (Scott’s edition), vol. vii. p. 303.
U||   These [the Roman Velites] were loose troops, answerable in a manner to
U||   those which we call now by a French name Enfans Perdues, but when we
U||   use our own terms, The Forlorn Hope.—Sir W. Raleigh, History of the
U||   World, v. 3, 8.
U||   Before the main battle of the Carthaginians he sets the auxiliaries and
U||   aid-soldiers, a confused rabble and medley of all sorts of nations,
U||   who, as the forlorn hope, bearing the furious heat of the first brunt,
U||   might, if they did no other good, yet, with receiving many a wound in
U||   their bodies dull and turn the edge of the enemy’s sword.—Holland,
U||   Livy, p. 765.
U||   Upon them the light-armed forlorn hope [qui primi agminis erant] of
U||   archers and darters of the Roman host, which went before the battle to
U||   skirmish, charged forcibly with their shot.—Id., ib. p. 641; cf. pp.
U||   1149, 1150, 1195.
U||   Christ’s descent into hell was not ad prædicandum, to preach; useless,
U||   where his auditory was all the forlorn hope.—Fuller, Worthies of
U||   England: Hampshire.
U||   Formal,    }
U||   Formally,
U||   Formality.
U||   It has been observed already, s. v. ‘Common Sense,’ that a vast number
U||   of our words have descended to us from abstruse sciences and
U||   speculations, we accepting them often in a total unconsciousness of the
U||   quarter from which they came. Another proof of this assertion is here;
U||   only, as it was metaphysics there, it is[Pg 112] logic here which has
U||   given us the word. It is curious to trace the steps by which
U||   ‘formality,’ which meant in the language of the Schools the
U||   essentiality, the innermost heart of a thing, that which gave it its
U||   form and shape, the ‘forma formans,’ should now mean something not
U||   merely so different, but so opposite.
U||   Be patient; for I will not let him stir,
U||   Till I have used the approved means I have,
U||   With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers
U||   To make of him a formal man again.
U||   Shakespeare, Comedy of Errors, act v. sc. 1.
U||   Next day we behold our bride a formal wife.—Fuller, Of the Clothes and
U||   Ornaments of the Jews, § 6.
U||   There are many graces required of us, whose material and formal part is
U||   repentance.—Bishop Taylor, Doctrine and Practice of Repentance, i. 3,
U||   47.
U||   It is not only as impious and irreligious a thing, but as senseless and
U||   as absurd a thing to deny that the Son of God hath redeemed the world,
U||   as to deny that God hath created the world; and he is as formally and
U||   as gloriously a martyr that dies for this article, The Son of God is
U||   come, as he that dies for this, There is a God.—Donne, Sermons, 1640,
U||   p. 69.
U||   According to the rule of the casuists, the formality of prodigality is
U||   inordinateness of our laying out, or misbestowing on what we should
U||   not.—Whitlock, Zootomia, p. 497.
U||   When the school makes pertinacy or obstinacy to be the formality of
U||   heresy, they say not true at all, unless it be meant the obstinacy of
U||   the will and choice; and if they do, they speak impertinently and
U||   inartificially, this being but one of the causes that make error become
U||   heresy; the adequate and perfect formality of heresy is whatsoever
U||   makes the error voluntary and vicious.—Bishop Taylor, Liberty of
U||   Prophesying, § 2, 10.
U||   Strong and importunate persuasions have not the nature and formality of
U||   force: but they have oftentimes the effect[Pg 113] of it; and he that
U||   solicits earnestly, sometimes determines as certainly as if he did
U||   force.—South, Sermons, 1744, vol. viii. p. 288.
U||   France,    }
U||   Frenchman.
U||   We consider now, and consider rightly, that there was properly no
U||   ‘France’ before there were Franks; and, speaking of the land and people
U||   before the Frankish conquest, we use Gaul, Gauls, and Gaulish; just as
U||   we should not now speak of Cæsar’s ‘journey into England.’ Our fathers
U||   had not these scruples (North, Plutarch’s Lives). See the quotation
U||   from Milton, s. v. ‘Civil.’
U||   When Cæsar saw his army prone to war,
U||   And fates so bent, lest sloth and long delay
U||   Might cross him, he withdrew his troops from France,
U||   And in all quarters musters men for Rome.
U||   Marlowe, First Book of Lucan.
U||   A Frenchman together with a Frenchwoman, likewise a Grecian man and
U||   woman, were let down alive into the beast-market into a vault under the
U||   ground, stoned all about.—Holland, Livy, p. 467.
U||   Fret. This, the A.S. ‘fretan,’ the German ‘fressen,’ to eat, is with us
U||   restricted now, though once it was otherwise, to the eating of the
U||   heart through care, according to an image which we all can only too
U||   well understand; and which has given the Pythagorean ‘Cor ne edito,’
U||   the French ‘dévoré de chagrins.’
U||   Adam afterward ayeines his defence
U||   Frette of that fruit.
U||   Piers Plowman, B-text, xviii. 193 (Skeat).
U||   He [Hercules] slough the cruel tirant Buserus,

U||   Thou makest his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting
U||   a garment.—Ps. xxxix. 12. P. B. V.
U||   Frightful. Now always active, that which inspires fright; but formerly
U||   as often passive, that which is, or is liable to be, frightened. See
U||   ‘Dreadful,’ ‘Hateful.’
U||   The wild and frightful herds,
U||   Not hearing other noise, but this of chattering birds,
U||   Feed fairly on the lawns.
U||   Drayton, Polyolbion, Song 13.
U||   Frippery. Now such trumpery, such odds and ends of cheap finery, as one
U||   might expect to meet at an old-clothes shop; but in our early
U||   dramatists and others of their time, the shop itself where old clothes
U||   were by the ‘fripper’ or broker scoured, ‘interpolated,’ and presented
U||   anew for sale (officina vestium tritarum, Skinner); nor had ‘frippery’
U||   then the contemptuous subaudition of worthlessness in the objects
U||   offered for sale which its present use would imply. See Littré,
U||   Dictionnaire, s. v. Friperie.
U||   Trinculo. O worthy Stephano, look what a wardrobe here is for thee.
U||   Caliban. Let it alone, thou fool, it is but trash.

U||   us.—Ben Jonson, Every Man in his Humour, act i. sc. 1.
U||   Fulsome,     }
U||   Fulsomeness.
U||   I have seen it questioned whether in the first syllable of ‘fulsome’ we
U||   are to find ‘foul’ or ‘full.’ There should be no question on the
U||   matter; seeing that ‘fulsome’ is properly no more than ‘full,’ and then
U||   secondly that which by its fulness and overfulness produces first
U||   satiety, and then loathing and disgust. This meaning of ‘fulsome’ is
U||   still retained in our only present application of the word, namely to
U||   compliments and flattery, which by their grossness produce this effect
U||   on him who is their object; but the word had once many more
U||   applications than this. See the quotation from Pope, s. v. ‘Bacchanal.’
U||   His lean, pale, hoar, and withered corpse, grew fulsome, fair, and
U||   fresh.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. vii.
U||   The next is Doctrine, in whose lips there dwells
U||   A spring of honey, sweeter than its name,
U||   Honey which never fulsome is, yet fills
U||   The widest souls.
U||   Beaumont, Psyche, b. xix. st. 210.
U||   Chaste and modest as he [Persius] is esteemed, it cannot be denied but
U||   that in some cases he is broad and fulsome. No decency is considered;
U||   no fulsomeness omitted.—Dryden, Dedication of Translations from
U||   Juvenal.
U||   Making her soul to loathe dainty meat, or putting a surfeit and
U||   fulsomeness into all which she enjoys.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p.
U||   32.
U||   [Pg 116]
U||   Garb. One of many words, all whose meaning has run to the surface. A
U||   man’s dress was once only a portion, and a very insignificant portion,
U||   of his ‘garb,’ which included his whole outward presentment to other
U||   men; now it is all.
U||   First, for your garb, it must be grave and serious,
U||   Very reserved and locked; not tell a secret
U||   On any terms, not to your father.
U||   Ben Jonson, Volpone, act iv. sc. 1.
U||   The greatest spirits, and those of the best and noblest breeding, are
U||   ever the most respective and obsequious in their garb, and the most
U||   observant and grateful in their language to all.—Feltham, Resolves,
U||   lxxxv.

U||   together to bring strangers into a liking of their welcome.—Hacket,

U||   He did not steal but emulate,
U||   And when he would like them appear,
U||   Their garb, but not their clothes, did wear.
U||   Denham, On the Death of Cowley.
U||   Garble. Writings only are ‘garbled’ now; and ‘garbled’ extracts are
U||   extracts dishonestly made, so shifted, mutilated, or in other ways
U||   tampered with, that, while presented as fair specimens, they convey a
U||   false impression. It is not difficult to trace the downward progress of
U||   the word. It is derived from the Low Latin ‘garbellare,’ to sift or
U||   cleanse corn from any dust or rubbish which may have become[Pg 117]
U||   mingled with it. It was then applied to any separation of the good from
U||   the bad, retaining that, rejecting this, and used most commonly of
U||   spices; then generally to picking and choosing, but without any
U||   intention to select the better and to dismiss the worse: and lastly, as
U||   at present, to picking and choosing with the distinct purpose of
U||   selecting that which should convey the worse impression, and dismissing
U||   that which should have conveyed a truer and a better. It is a very
U||   favourite word in its earlier uses with Fuller.
U||   Garbling of bow-staves (anno 1 R. 3, cap. 11) is the sorting or culling
U||   out of the good from the bad.—Cowell, The Interpreter, s.v.
U||   There was a fair hospital, built to the honour of St. Anthony in
U||   Bennet’s Fink, in this city; the protectors and proctors whereof
U||   claimed a privilege to themselves, to garble the live pigs in the
U||   markets of the city; and such as they found starved or otherwise
U||   unwholesome for man’s sustenance they would slit in the ear, tie a bell
U||   about their necks, and turn them loose about the city.—Fuller, Worthies
U||   of England: London.
U||   Garbling men’s manners you did well divide,
U||   To take the Spaniards’ wisdom, not their pride;
U||   With French activity you stored your mind,
U||   Leaving to them their fickleness behind;
U||   And soon did learn, your temperance was such,
U||   A sober industry even from the Dutch.
U||   Id., Worthies of England. A Panegyric on Charles II.
U||   To garble, to cleanse from dross and dirt, as grocers do their spices,
U||   to pick or cull out.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   Garland. At present we know no other ‘garlands’ but of flowers; but
U||   ‘garland’ was at one time a technical name for the royal crown or
U||   diadem, and[Pg 118] not a poetical one, as might at first sight appear;
U||   as witness these words of Matthew of Paris in his Life of Henry III.:
U||   Rex veste deauratâ, et coronulâ aureâ, quæ vulgariter garlanda dicitur,
U||   redimitus.
U||   In the adoption and obtaining of the garland, I being seduced and
U||   provoked by sinister counsel did commit a naughty and abominable
U||   act.—Grafton, Chronicle of King Richard III.
U||   In whose [Edward the Fourth’s] time, and by whose occasion, what about
U||   the getting of the garland, keeping it, losing and winning again, it
U||   hath cost more English blood than hath twice the winning of France.—Sir
U||   T. More, History of King Richard III. p. 107.
U||   What in me was purchased,
U||   Falls unto thee in a more fairer sort;
U||   So now the garland wear’st successively.
U||   Shakespeare, 2 Henry IV. act iv. sc. 4.
U||   Garret. The Old French ‘garite,’ which is our ‘garret,’ is properly a
U||   place of refuge or safety, being derived from the verb ‘garir;’ thus
U||   ‘gagner la guérite,’ to save oneself by flight. But this place of
U||   safety would be often on a high wall, in a watch-tower, upon the tops
U||   of houses; and thus the notion of the ‘garret’ was connected with that
U||   of the highest stage or storey. The subaudition of its being the
U||   poorest and meanest place in the house is an afterthought, and
U||   certainly has no place in any of the following uses of the word.
U||   Thanne walkede y ferrer, and went al abouten,
U||   And seigh halles full hyghe, and houses ful noble
U||   With gaie garites and grete, and iche hole y-glased.

U||   places for watche men; therefor it nedethe to have out

U||   Gazette. The French form of an Italian word ‘gazzetta,’ designating a
U||   small piece of tin money current at Venice, of the value of less than a
U||   farthing (see Florio). This word ‘gazzetta’ may possibly be quite
U||   distinct in origin from ‘gazzetta,’ the name of a monthly bill of news
U||   printed commonly at Venice (see Skeat’s Dictionary). We see the word in
U||   this latter sense, but not as yet thoroughly at home in English, for it
U||   still retains [as it retained much later] an Italian termination, in
U||   Ben Jonson’s Volpone (act v. sc. 2), of which the scene is laid at
U||   Venice. Curiously enough the same play gives also an example, quoted
U||   below, of ‘gazette’ in the sense of a coin.
U||   If you will have a stool, it will cost you a gazet, which is almost a
U||   penny.—Coryat, Crudities, vol. ii. p. 15.
U||   What monstrous and most painful circumstance
U||   Is here to get some three or four gazets,
U||   Some threepence in the whole.
U||   Ben Jonson, Volpone, act ii. sc. 2.
U||   Gelding. Restrained at present to horses which have ceased to be
U||   entire; but until ‘eunuch,’ which is of somewhat late adoption, had
U||   been introduced into the language, serving also the needs which that
U||   serves now.
U||   Thanne Joseph was lad in Egepte, and bought him Potiphar, the gelding
U||   of Pharao.—Gen. xxxix. 1. Wiclif.[Pg 120]
U||   And whanne thei weren come up of the watir, the spirit of the Lord
U||   ravyschide Filip, and the gelding say hym no more.—Acts viii. 39.
U||   Wiclif.
U||   Lysimachus was very angry, and thought great scorn that Demetrius
U||   should reckon him a gelding.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 741.
U||   Generosity. We still use ‘generous’ occasionally in the sense of highly
U||   or nobly born; but ‘generosity’ has quite lost this its earlier sense,
U||   and acquired a purely ethical meaning. Its history illustrates, as does
U||   the history of so many other words, what one may call the aristocratic
U||   tendencies of language.
U||   Nobility began in thine ancestors and ended in thee: and the generosity
U||   that they gained by virtue, thou hast blotted by vice.—Lyly, Euphues
U||   and his England.
U||   Their eyes are commonly black and small, noses little, nails almost as
U||   long as their fingers, but serving to distinguish their
U||   generosity.—Harris, Voyages, vol. i. p. 465.
U||   Genial. It is curious to find ‘genial’ used in a sense not merely so
U||   different, but so directly opposed to that in which we employ it now,
U||   as in the quotation which follows we do. Whether there are other
U||   examples of the same use, I am unable to say.
U||   There are not a few very much to be pitied, whose industry being not
U||   attended with natural parts, they have sweat to little purpose, and
U||   rolled the stone in vain, which chiefly proceedeth from natural
U||   incapacity and genial indisposition, at least to those particulars
U||   whereunto they apply their endeavours.—Sir T. Browne, Vulgar Errors, b.
U||   i. c. 5.
U||   Gestation. Now a technical word applied only to the period during which
U||   the females of animals carry their young; but acknowledging no such
U||   limitation once.
U||   [Pg 121]
U||   Gestation in a chariot or wagon hath in it a shaking of the body, but
U||   some vehement, and some more soft.—Sir T. Elyot, Castle of Health, b.
U||   ii. c. 34.
U||   Gestation, an exercise of the body, by being carried in coach, litter,
U||   upon horseback, or in a vessel on the water.—Holland, Pliny,
U||   Explanation of the Words of Art.
U||   Ghost. It is only in the very highest acceptation of all that ‘Ghost’
U||   and ‘Spirit’ are now synonymous and exchangeable. They once were so
U||   through the entire range of their several uses.
U||   And in this manere was man made,
U||   And thus God gaf hym a goost.
U||   Piers Plowman, B-text, Passus ix. 45 (Skeat).
U||   As wel in body as goost, chaste was sche.
U||   Chaucer, The Doctoures Tale (Morris, iii. p. 77).
U||   He sawe that the heavens opened, and the goost as a dove commynge downe
U||   upon Him.—Mark i. 10. Coverdale.
U||   Girl. A child, and this of either sex. In Middle English the phrase
U||   ‘knave gerlys’ occurs in the sense of boys. It fared in early English
U||   not otherwise with ‘wench’ (which see).
U||   Thorw wyn and thorw women there was Loth acombred,
U||   And there gat in glotonye gerlis that were cherlis.
U||   Piers Plowman, B-text, Passus i. 32 (Skeat).
U||   In daunger he hadde at his owne assise
U||   The yonge gurles of the diocise,
U||   And knew here counseil.
U||   Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, The Prologue, 663
U||   (Morris, ii. p. 21).
U||   Gist. This, the Old French ‘giste,’ from the old ‘gésir’ (Latin
U||   ‘jacēre’) meant formerly, as the French word ‘gîte’ means still, the
U||   place where one lodges for the night. A scroll containing the route and
U||   resting places[Pg 122] of a royal party during a progress was sometimes
U||   so called. For the connexion between ‘gist’ in this sense and ‘gist’ as
U||   we use it now see Skeat’s Dictionary.
U||   After he had sent Popilius before in spial, and perceived that the
U||   avenues were open in all parts, he marched forward himself, and by the
U||   second gist came to Dium [secundis castris pervenit ad Dium].—Holland,
U||   Livy, p. 1174.
U||   The guides who were to conduct them on their way had commandment so to
U||   cast their gists and journeys that by three of the clock in the morning
U||   of the third day they might assail Pythoum.—Id., ib. p. 1193.
U||   Glory,      }
U||   Glorious,
U||   Gloriously.
U||   ‘Glory’ is never employed now in the sense of ‘vain-glory,’ nor
U||   ‘glorious’ in that of ‘vain-glorious,’ as once they often were.
U||   In military commanders and soldiers, vain-glory is an essential point;
U||   for as iron sharpens iron, so by glory one courage sharpeneth
U||   another.—Bacon, Essays, 54.
U||   So commonly actions begun in glory shut up in shame.—Bishop Hall,
U||   Contemplations, On Babel.
U||   To that intent God maid him thus,
U||   That man suld nocht be glorious,
U||   Nor in himself na thing suld se
U||   But mater of humilitie.
U||   Lyndesay, The Monarchie.
U||   Some took this for a glorious brag; others thought he [Alcibiades] was
U||   like enough to have done it.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 183.
U||   Likewise glorious followers, who make themselves as trumpets of the
U||   commendation of those they follow, are full of inconveniences. For they
U||   taint business through want of secrecy; and they export honour from a
U||   man, and make him a return in envy.—Bacon, Essays, 48 (Abbott, ii. p.
U||   66).
U||   [Pg 123]
U||   He [Anselm] little dreamt then that the weeding-hook of Reformation
U||   would after two ages pluck up his glorious poppy [prelacy] from
U||   insulting over the good corn [presbytery].—Milton, Reason of Church
U||   Government, b. i. c. 5.
U||   I speak it not gloriously, or out of affectation.—Ben Jonson, Every Man
U||   out of his Humour, act ii. sc. 1.
U||   Good-nature,  }
U||   Good-natured.
U||   As metaphysics have yielded us ‘common sense,’ and logic ‘formal’ and
U||   ‘formality,’ so we owe to theology ‘good-nature.’ By it our elder
U||   divines understood far more than we understand by it now; even all
U||   which it is possible for a man to have, without having the grace of
U||   God. The contrast between grace and nature was of course unknown to the
U||   Greeks; but, this being kept in mind, we may say that the ‘good-nature’
U||   of our theology two centuries ago was as nearly as possible expressed
U||   by the εὐφυΐα of Aristotle (Eth. Nic. iii. 7; compare the ‘heureusement
U||   né’ of the French); the genial preparedness for the reception of every
U||   high teaching. In the paper of The Spectator, quoted below, which
U||   treats exclusively of ‘good-nature,’ the word is passing, but has by no
U||   means passed, into its modern meaning. See ‘Ill-nature.’
U||   Good-nature, being the relics and remains of that shipwreck which Adam
U||   made, is the proper and immediate disposition to holiness. When
U||   good-nature is heightened by the grace of God, that which was natural
U||   becomes now spiritual.—Bishop Taylor, Sermon preached at the Funeral of
U||   Sir George Dalstone.
U||   Good-nature! alas, where is it? Since Adam fell, there was never any
U||   such thing in rerum naturâ; if there be any good thing in any man, it
U||   is all from grace. We may talk of this and that, of good-natured men,
U||   and I know not what; but the very truth is, set grace aside (I mean all
U||   grace, both[Pg 124] renewing grace and restraining grace), there is no
U||   more good-nature in any man than there was in Cain and in Judas. That
U||   thing which we use to call good-nature is indeed but a subordinate
U||   means or instrument, whereby God restraineth some men more than others,
U||   from their birth and special constitution, from sundry outrageous
U||   exorbitances, and so is a branch of this restraining grace whereof we
U||   now speak.—Sanderson, Sermons, 1671, vol. i. p. 279.
U||   If any good did appear in the conversation of some men who followed
U||   that religion [the Pagan], it is not to be imputed to the influence of
U||   that, but to some better cause; to the relics of good-nature, to the
U||   glimmerings of natural light, or (perhaps also) to secret whispers and
U||   impressions of divine grace on some men’s minds vouchsafed in pity to
U||   them.—Barrow, Sermon 14 on the Apostles’ Creed.
U||   They [infidels] explode all natural difference of good and evil;
U||   deriding benignity, mercy, pity, gratitude, ingenuity; that is, all
U||   instances of good-nature, as childish and silly dispositions.—Id.,
U||   Sermon 6 on the Apostles’ Creed.
U||   Xenophon, in the Life of his imaginary Prince, is always celebrating
U||   the philanthropy or good-nature of his hero, which he tells us he
U||   brought into the world with him.—Spectator, no. 169.
U||   Gospeller. Now seldom used save in ritual language, and there
U||   designating the priest or deacon who in the divine service reads the
U||   Gospel of the day; but employed once as equivalent to ‘Evangelist,’ and
U||   subsequently applied to adherents of the Reformed faith; both which
U||   meanings have since departed from it.
U||   Marke, the gospeller, was the goostli sone of Petre in baptysm.—Wiclif,
U||   The Prologe of Marke.
U||   The persecution was carried on against the gospellers with much
U||   fierceness by those of the Roman persuasion.—Strype, Memorial of
U||   Archbishop Cranmer, b. iii. c. 16.
U||   [Pg 125]
U||   Gossip. It would be interesting to collect instances in which the
U||   humbler classes of society have retained the correct use of a word,
U||   which has been let go by those of higher education. ‘Gossip’ is one,
U||   being still used by our peasantry in its first and etymological sense,
U||   namely as a sponsor in baptism—one sib or akin in God, according to the
U||   doctrine of the medieval Church, that sponsors contracted a spiritual
U||   affinity with the child for whom they stood. ‘Gossips,’ in this primary
U||   sense, would often be familiar with one another—and thus the word was
U||   applied to all familiars and intimates. At a later day it came to
U||   signify such idle talk, the ‘commérage’ (which word has exactly the
U||   same history), which too often would find place in the intercourse of
U||   such.
U||   They had mothers as we had; and those mothers had gossips (if their
U||   children were christened), as we are.—Ben Jonson, The Staple of News,
U||   The Induction.
U||   Thus fareth the golden mean, through the misconstruction of the
U||   extremes. Well-tempered zeal is lukewarmness; devotion is hypocrisy;
U||   charity, ostentation; constancy, obstinacy; gravity, pride; humility,
U||   abjection of spirit; and so go through the whole parish of virtues,
U||   where misprision and envy are gossips, be sure the child shall be
U||   nicknamed.—Whitlock, Zootomia, p. 3.
U||   Should a great lady that was invited to be a gossip, in her place send
U||   her kitchen-maid, ’twould be ill-taken.—Selden, Table-Talk, Prayer.
U||   Grave. The O.E. ‘grafan’ (compare German ‘graben,’ ‘to grave’) was once
U||   used in the senses which ‘graben’ still retains. See ‘Engrave.’
U||   They sette mark hir metyng sholde be
U||   Ther King Nynus was graven, under a tree.
U||   Chaucer, Legend of Good Women, 784 (Skeat, p. 50).
U||   [Pg 126]
U||   I wil laye sege to the rounde aboute, and grave up dykes against
U||   ye.—Isai. xxix. 3. Coverdale.
U||   He hath graven and digged up a pit, and is fallen himself into the
U||   destruction that he made for other.—Ps. vii. 16. (P. B. V.)
U||   Grope. Now to feel for, and uncertainly, as does a blind man or one in
U||   the dark; but once simply to feel, to grasp.
U||   Tho han hondis, and schulen not grope [et non palpabunt, Vulg.]—Ps.
U||   cxiii. 7. Wiclif.
U||   I have touched and tasted the Lord, and groped Him with hands, and yet
U||   unbelief hath made all unsavoury.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 231.
U||   Grudge. Now to repine at the good which others already have, or which
U||   we may be required to impart to them; but it formerly implied open
U||   utterances of discontent and displeasure against others, and did the
U||   work which ‘to murmur’ does now. Traces of this still survive in our
U||   English Bible.
U||   And the Farisees and scribis grutchiden; seiynge, For this resseyveth
U||   synful men, and etith with hem.—Luke xv. 2. Wiclif.
U||   After bakbytyng cometh grucching or murmuracioun, and somtyme it
U||   springith of impacience agayns God, and somtyme agains man.—Chaucer,
U||   The Persones Tale (Morris, iii. p. 305).
U||   Yea without grudging Christ suffered the cruel Jews to crown Him with
U||   most sharp thorns, and to strike Him with a reed.—Foxe, Book of
U||   Martyrs: Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   Use hospitality one to another without grudging [ἄνευ γογγυσμῶν].—1
U||   Pet. iv. 9. (A.V.)
U||   Guard. Is ‘guard,’ in the sense of welt or border to a garment, nothing
U||   more than a special application[Pg 127] of ‘guard,’ as it is familiar
U||   to us all? or is it altogether a different word with its own etymology,
U||   and only by accident offering the same letters in the same sequence? I
U||   have assumed, though not with perfect confidence, the former; for
U||   indeed otherwise the word would have no right to a place here.
U||   Antipater wears in outward show his apparel with a plain white welt or
U||   guard, but he is within all purple, I warrant you, and as red as
U||   scarlet.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 412.
U||   Then were the fathers of those children glad men to see their sons
U||   apparelled like Romans, in fair long gowns, garded with purple.—North,
U||   Plutarch’s Lives, p. 492.
U||   Give him a livery
U||   More guarded than his fellows.
U||   Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice, act ii. sc. 2.
U||   Hag. One of the many words applied formerly to both sexes, but now
U||   restrained only to one. See ‘Coquet,’ ‘Girl,’ ‘Harlot,’ ‘Hoyden,’
U||   ‘Termagant,’ ‘Witch.’
U||   And that old hag [Silenus] that with a staff his staggering limbs doth
U||   stay,
U||   Scarce able on his ass to sit for reeling every way.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. iv.
U||   Curst be thy throte and soule. Raven,
U||   Schriech-owle, hag [addressed to a man].
U||   Chapman, Byron’s Conspiracies, act iii.
U||   Handsome,     }
U||   Handsomeness.
U||   Now referred exclusively to comeliness, either literal or figurative.
U||   It is of course closely connected with ‘handy,’ indeed differs from it
U||   only in termination, and in all early uses means having prompt and
U||   dexterous use of the hands, and then generally able, adroit. In
U||   Cotgrave’s[Pg 128] Dictionary, ‘habile,’ ‘adroit,’ ‘maniable,’ take
U||   precedence of ‘beau,’ ‘belle,’ as its French equivalents. See
U||   ‘Unhandsome.’
U||   Few of them [the Germans] use swords or great lances; but carry
U||   javelins with a narrow and short iron, but so sharp and handsome, that,
U||   as occasion serveth, with the same weapon they can fight both at hand
U||   and afar off.—Greenwey, Tacitus, vol. i. p. 259.
U||   A light footman’s shield he takes unto him, and a Spanish blade by his
U||   side, more handsome to fight short and close [ad propiorem habili
U||   pugnam].—Holland, Livy, p. 255.
U||   Philopœmen sought to put down all exercise, which made men’s bodies
U||   unmeet to take pains, and to become soldiers to fight in defence of
U||   their country, that otherwise would have been very able and handsome
U||   for the same.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 306.
U||   Both twain of them made haste,
U||   And girding close for handsomeness their garments to their waist,
U||   Bestirred their cunning hands apace.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. vi.
U||   Harbinger. This word belongs at present to our poetical diction, and to
U||   that only; its original significance being nearly or quite forgotten:
U||   as is evident from the inaccurate ways in which it has come to be used;
U||   as though a ‘harbinger’ were merely one who announced the coming, and
U||   not always one who prepared a place and lodging, a ‘harbour,’ for
U||   another. He did indeed announce the near approach, but only as an
U||   accidental consequence of his office. Our Lord, if we may reverently
U||   say it, assumed to Himself precisely the office of a ‘harbinger,’ when
U||   He said, ‘I go to prepare a place for you’ (John xiv. 2).
U||   [Pg 129]
U||   There was a harbinger who had lodged a gentleman in a very ill room;
U||   who expostulated with him somewhat rudely; but the harbinger carelessly
U||   said, ‘You will take pleasure in it when you are out of it.’—Bacon,
U||   Apophthegms.
U||   I’ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
U||   The hearing of my wife with your approach.
U||   Shakespeare, Macbeth, act i. sc. 4.
U||   The fame of Frederick’s valour and maiden fortune, never as yet spotted
U||   with ill success, like a harbinger hastening before, had provided
U||   victory to entertain him at his arrival.—Fuller, Holy War, b. iii. c.
U||   31.
U||   A winged harbinger from bright heaven flown
U||   Bespeaks a lodging-room
U||   For the mighty King of love,
U||   The spotless structure of a virgin womb.
U||   Bishop Taylor, On the Annunciation.
U||   Hardy,   }
U||   Hardily.
U||   When used of persons, ‘hardy’ means now enduring, indifferent to
U||   fatigue, hunger, thirst, heat, cold, and the like. But it had once a
U||   far more prevailing sense of bold, which now only remains to it in
U||   connexion with things, as we should still speak of a ‘hardy,’ meaning
U||   thereby a bold, assertion; though never now of a ‘hardy,’ if we
U||   intended a bold or daring person. Lord Bacon’s Charles the Hardy is
U||   Charles le Téméraire, or Charles the Bold, as we always style him now.
U||   Hap helpeth hardy man alday, quod he.
U||   Chaucer, Legend of Good Women (Skeat, p. 86).
U||   It is not to be forgotten that Commineus observeth of his first master,
U||   duke Charles the Hardy, namely, that he would communicate his secrets
U||   with none.—Bacon, Essays, 27.
U||   Hardily [audacter, Vulg.] he entride in to Pilat, and axide the body of
U||   Jhesu.—Mark xv. 43. Wiclif (earlier version).
U||   [Pg 130]
U||   Harlot. I have no desire to entangle myself in the question of this
U||   word’s etymology; it is sufficient to observe that it was used of both
U||   sexes alike; and though for the most part a word of slight and
U||   contempt, signifying generally a low fellow, vagabond, buffoon, acrobat
U||   (in the Promptorium ‘scurrus’ is the Latin equivalent of it), implied
U||   nothing of that special form of sin to which it now exclusively refers.
U||   Salle never harlotte have happe, thorowe helpe of my Lord,
U||   To kille a crownde kynge, with crysome enoynttede.
U||   Morte Arthure, 2446.
U||   That non harlot were so hardy to leyne hande uppon hym.
U||   Piers Plowman, B-text, Passus 18, 77 (Skeat).
U||   He was a gentil harlot and a kynde.
U||   Chaucer, Prologue, 647.
U||   Thou lord (God) has done mare wondire than the herlot: he lerid to ga
U||   in a corde, thou makis men to ga abouen the watire.—Hampole, Psalm
U||   xxxix. 7 (ed. Bramley, 1884).
U||   No man but he and thou and such other false harlots praiseth any such
U||   preaching.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs; Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   About this time [A.D. 1264] a redress of certain sects was intended,
U||   among which one by name specially occurreth, and called the assembly of
U||   harlots,[289]16 a kind of people of a lewd disposition and
U||   uncivil.—Id., ib. vol. i. p. 435.
U||   Harness. In French the difference between the ‘harness’ of a man and of
U||   a horse is expressed by a slight difference in the spelling, ‘harnois’
U||   in one case, ‘harnais’ in the other. In English we only retain the word
U||   now in the second of these uses.
U||   [Pg 131]
U||   But when a stronger then he cometh apon hym and overcommeth him, he
U||   taketh from him his harnes wherin he trusted, and devideth his
U||   gooddes.—Luke xi. 22. Tyndale.
U||   When Abram herde that his brother was taken, he harnessed his
U||   bonde-servauntes, and followed after them untill Dan.—Gen. xiv.
U||   Coverdale.
U||   Those that sleep in Jesus shall God bring with Him, and harness them
U||   with the bright armour of life and immortality.—H. More, Grand Mystery
U||   of Godliness, b. iv. c. 18.
U||   And all about the courtly stable
U||   Bright-harnessed angels sit in order serviceable.
U||   Milton, On the Nativity.
U||   Harvest. It is remarkable that while spring, summer, winter, have all
U||   their home-bred names, we designate the other quarter of the year by
U||   its Latin title ‘autumn,’ ‘hærfest’ (= the German ‘Herbst’) having been
U||   appropriated to the ingathering of the fruits of this season, not to
U||   the season itself. In this indeed we are truer to the proper meaning of
U||   ‘harvest’ than the Germans, who have transferred the word from the
U||   former to the latter; for it is closely related with the Greek καρπός.
U||   Occasionally, however, as in the passages which follow, ‘harvest’
U||   assumes with us also the signification of autumn.
U||   These ben hervest trees [arbores autumnales, Vulg.] with out fruyt,
U||   twies deed, drawun up bi the roote.—Jude 12. Wiclif.
U||   There stood the Springtime with a crown of fresh and fragrant flowers;
U||   There waited Summer naked stark, all save a wheaten hat;
U||   And Harvest smeared with treading grapes late at the pressing fat;
U||   And lastly quaking for the cold stood Winter all forlorn.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. ii.
U||   [Pg 132]
U||   Hassock. Already in Phillips’s New World of Words, 1706, the ‘hassock’
U||   was what it is now, ‘a kind of straw cushion used to kneel upon in
U||   churches;’ and some of us may remember to have seen in country churches
U||   ‘hassocks’ of solid tufts of coarse black grass which had so grown and
U||   matted together that they served this purpose sufficiently well. But
U||   this is only the secondary and transferred use of the word. It was once
U||   the name by which this coarse grass growing in these rank tufts was
U||   itself called; and this name, as Forby tells us, in Norfolk it still
U||   bears. See Way’s Promptorium, s. v. ‘Hassok.’
U||   Land so full of hassocks as to be impossible to find the deer among
U||   them.—Hutchinson, Drainage of Land.
U||   These hassocks, in bogs, were formerly taken up with a part of the
U||   soil, matted together with roots, shaped, trimmed, and dressed, a
U||   sufficient part of their shaggy and tufted surface being left to make
U||   kneeling much easier than on the pavement of the church or the
U||   bare-boarded floor of a pew.—Forby, East Anglia.
U||   Hateful. This has undergone exactly the same limitation of meaning as
U||   ‘Dreadful’ and ‘Frightful,’ which see.
U||   Little office
U||   The hateful Commons will perform for us,
U||   Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
U||   Shakespeare, Richard II., act ii. sc. 2.
U||   No more shall nation against nation rise,
U||   Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes.
U||   Pope, Messiah, 57.
U||   Hear. Our scholars of the seventeenth century occasionally use the
U||   Latin idiom, ‘to hear well,’ or[Pg 133] ‘to hear ill,’ i.e. concerning
U||   oneself (bene audire, male audire), instead of, to be praised, or to be
U||   blamed.
U||   [Fabius] was well aware, that not only within his own camp, but also
U||   now at Rome, he heard ill for his temporizing and slow
U||   proceedings.—Holland, Livy, p. 441.
U||   What more national corruption, for which England hears ill abroad, than
U||   household gluttony?—Milton, Areopagitica, p. 431.
U||   The abbot made his mind known to the Lord Keeper, that he would gladly
U||   be present in the Abbey of Westminster on our Christmas-day in the
U||   morning, to behold and hear how that great feast was solemnized in our
U||   congregations, which heard very ill beyond the seas for
U||   profaneness.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part i. p. 210.
U||   Hearse. Now the carriage in which the dead are conveyed to the grave,
U||   but this was not the meaning from the first. The origin is the French
U||   ‘herse,’ a harrow; this implement in France being made in a triangular
U||   form, not square as with us. Hence the name of ‘herce’ or ‘herche’ was
U||   given to a triangular framework, generally of iron, used for holding a
U||   number of candles at funerals; and which, being elaborately fashioned
U||   and framed, was allowed afterwards to remain in the church for a longer
U||   or shorter period.
U||   In the quer was a hersse mad of tymbur and covered with blake, and
U||   armes upon the blake.—Diary of Henry Machyn, 1550-1563, p. 44.
U||   A cenotaph is an empty funeral monument or tomb, erected for the honour
U||   of the dead; in imitation of which our hearses here in England are set
U||   up in churches during the continuance of a year or for the space of
U||   certain months.—Weever, Ancient Funeral Monuments, p. 32.
U||   Hearse, an empty tomb erected for the honour of the dead.—Phillips, New
U||   World of Words.
U||   [Pg 134]
U||   The beating of thy pulse, when thou art well,
U||   Is just the tolling of thy passing bell.
U||   Night is thy hearse, whose sable canopy
U||   Covers alike deceasëd day and thee.
U||   And all those weeping dews that nightly fall
U||   Are but the tears shed for thy funeral.
U||   Bishop King, Poems, p. 19.
U||   Help. ‘To help’ used not unfrequently to designate an assisting in one
U||   particular manner, in that namely of healing. A recent editor of
U||   Shakespeare, not having this present in his mind, has said of those
U||   lines first quoted below: ‘We cannot but believe Shakespeare wrote, Do
U||   wounds salve wounds, &c., or Do wounds heal wounds, &c.’ There is
U||   indeed nothing here needing to be set right.
U||   Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?
U||   Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
U||   Shakespeare, Lucrece.
U||   Love doth to her repair,
U||   To help him of his blindness,
U||   And being helpt inhabits there.
U||   Id., Two Gentlemen of Verona, act iv. sc. 2.
U||   Still she retains
U||   Her maiden gentleness, and oft at eve
U||   Visits the herds along the twilight meadows,
U||   Helping all urchin blasts and ill-luck signs
U||   That the shrewd meddling elf delights to make.
U||   Milton, Comus, 842.
U||   Hereafter. This word, while it looks on to a future, always looks on to
U||   one more or less divided by an interval of time from the present. But
U||   it was often employed as equivalent to ‘from this time forth’ in our
U||   Elizabethan literature; it is so in the examples which follow.
U||   [Pg 135]
U||   Hereafter [ἀπ’ ἄρτι] ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God
U||   ascending and descending on the Son of man.—St. John i. 51. (A.V.)
U||   We will establish our estate upon
U||   Our eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter
U||   The prince of Cumberland.
U||   Shakespeare, Macbeth, act i. sc. 4.
U||   Hide. This word is at present only contemptuously applied to the skin
U||   of man, being reserved almost exclusively for that of beasts; but it
U||   had once the same extent of meaning as by the German ‘haut’ is still
U||   retained, which is ‘cutis’ and ‘pellis’ both.
U||   The ladye fayre of hew and hyde
U||   Shee sate downe by the bedside.
U||   Eger and Grine, 263.
U||   Her kerchers were all of silk,
U||   Her hayre as white as any milke,
U||   Lovesome of hue and hyde.
U||   Ballad of John de Reeve, 226.
U||   Hobby. The ‘hobby’ being the ambling nag ridden for pleasure, and then
U||   the child’s toy in imitation of the same, had in these senses nearly
U||   passed out of use, when the word revived, by a very natural transfer,
U||   in the sense which it now has, of a favourite pursuit which carries a
U||   man easily and pleasantly forward.
U||   They have likewise excellent good horses (we term them hobbies), which
U||   have not the same pace that other horses in their course, but a soft
U||   and round amble, setting one leg before another very finely.—Holland,
U||   Camden’s Ireland, p. 63.
U||   King Agesilaus, having a great sort of little children, was one day
U||   disposed to solace himself among them in a gallery where they played,
U||   and took a little hobby-horse of[Pg 136] wood, and bestrid
U||   it.—Puttenham, Art of English Poesy, b. iii. c. 24.
U||   A hobby-horse, or some such pretty toy,
U||   A rattle would befit you better, boy.
U||   Randolph, Poems, p. 19.
U||   Homely. The etymology of ‘homely’ which Milton puts into the mouth of
U||   Comus,
U||   ‘It is for homely features to keep home;
U||   They had their name hence,’
U||   witnesses that in his time it had the same meaning which it has in
U||   ours. At an earlier day, however, it much more nearly corresponded to
U||   the German ‘heimlich,’ that is, secret, inward, familiar, as those may
U||   be presumed to be that share in a common home. ‘Homeliness’ is more
U||   than once the word by which Wiclif translates ‘mansuetudo:’ thus, 2
U||   Cor. x. 1; Jam. i. 21.
U||   And the enemyes of a man ben thei that ben homeli with him.—Matt. x.
U||   36. Wiclif. [Cf. Judg. xix. 4, and often.]
U||   God graunte the thin homly fo espye:
U||   For in this world nys worse pestilence
U||   Than homly foo, alday in thy presence.
U||   Chaucer, The Marchaundes Tale (Morris, ii. p. 335).
U||   Such peple be able and worthi to be admytted into the homeli reding of
U||   Holi Writt.—Pecock, Repressor, c. 3.
U||   With all these men I was right homely, and communed with them long time
U||   and oft.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs; Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   Hoyden. Now and for a long time since a clownish ill-bred girl; what is
U||   vulgarly called in America a ‘gal-boy,’ yet it is only another form of
U||   ‘heathen.’ Remote as the words appear at starting, it will not be hard
U||   to bring them close together. In[Pg 137] the first place, it is only by
U||   a superinduced meaning that ‘heathen’ has its present sense of
U||   non-christian; it is properly, as Grimm has abundantly shown, as indeed
U||   Piers Plowman had told us long ago, a dweller on the heath; then any
U||   living a wild savage life; thus we have in Wiclif (Acts xxviii. 1),
U||   ‘And the hethene men [barbari, Vulg.] diden to us not litil curtesie;’
U||   and only afterwards was the word applied to those who resisted to the
U||   last the humanizing influences of the Christian faith. This ‘heathen’
U||   is in Dutch ‘heyden’ (see Sewel); while less than two hundred years ago
U||   ‘hoyden’ was by no means confined, as it now is, to the female sex, the
U||   clownish ill-bred girl, but was oftener applied to men.
U||   Shall I argue of conversation with this hoyden, to go and practise at
U||   his opportunities in the larder?—Milton, Colasterion.
U||   Falourdin, m. A lusk, lowt, lurden, a lubberly sloven, heavy sot,

U||   Humour,    }
U||   Humourous,
U||   Humourist.
U||   The four ‘humours’ in man, according to the old physicians, were blood,
U||   choler, phlegm, and melancholy. So long as these were duly tempered,
U||   all would be well. But so soon as any of them unduly preponderated, the
U||   man became ‘humourous,’ one ‘humour’ or another bearing too great a
U||   sway in him. As such, his conduct would not be according to the[Pg 138]
U||   received rule of other men, but have something peculiar, whimsical,
U||   self-willed in it. In this the self-asserting character of the
U||   ‘humourous’ man lay the point of contact, the middle term, between the
U||   modern use of ‘humour’ and the ancient. It was his ‘humour’ which would
U||   lead a man to take an original view and aspect of things, a ‘humourous’
U||   aspect, first in the old sense, which in some of our provincial
U||   dialects still lives on, and then in that which we now employ. The
U||   classical passage in English literature on ‘humour’ and its history is
U||   the Prologue, or ‘Stage,’ as it is called, to Ben Jonson’s Every Man
U||   out of his Humour; it is, however, too long to cite; an earlier occurs
U||   in Gower’s Confessio Amantis, lib. 7, in init. See ‘Temper.’
U||   ‘Humourous’ has been sometimes used in quite another sense, as simply
U||   equivalent to moist; so in the passage from Chapman’s Homer, quoted
U||   below.
U||   In which [kingdom of heaven] neither such high-flown enthusiasts, nor
U||   any dry churlish reasoners and disputers, shall have either part or
U||   portion, till they lay down those gigantic humours, and become (as our
U||   Saviour Christ, who is that unerring Truth, has prescribed) like little
U||   children.—H. More, Grand Mystery of Godliness, b. viii. c. 15.
U||   Good Humour is not only the best security against enthusiasm, but the
U||   best foundation of piety and true religion. For if right thoughts and
U||   worthy apprehensions of the Supreme Being are fundamental to all true
U||   worship and adoration, ’tis more than probable we shall never miscarry
U||   in this respect except through Ill Humour only.—Shaftesbury, Works,
U||   1727, vol. i. p. 22.
U||   Yet such is now the duke’s condition,
U||   That he misconstrues all that you have done;
U||   The duke is humourous.
U||   Shakespeare, As You Like It, act i. sc. 2.
U||   [Pg 139]
U||   The people thereof [Ephraim] were active, valiant, ambitious of honour;
U||   but withal hasty, humourous, hard to be pleased; forward enough to
U||   fight with their foes, and too forward to fall out with their
U||   friends.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. ii. c. 9.
U||   Or it may be (what is little better than that), instead of the living
U||   righteousness of Christ, he will magnify himself in some humourous
U||   pieces of holiness of his own.—H. More, Grand Mystery of Godliness, b.
U||   viii. c. 14.
U||   Upon his sight of the first signs and experiments of the plagues which
U||   did accompany them, he [Pharaoh] demeaned himself like a proud
U||   phantastic humorist.—Jackson, Christ’s Everlasting Priesthood, b. x. c.
U||   40.
U||   The seamen are a nation by themselves, a humourous and fantastic
U||   people.—Clarendon, History of the Rebellion, b. ii. in init.
U||   Wretched men, that shake off the true comely habit of religion, to
U||   bespeak them a new-fashioned suit of profession at an humourist’s
U||   shop!—Adams, The Devil’s Banquet, p. 52.
U||   This eased her heart and dried her humourous eye.
U||   Chapman, Homer’s Odysseis, b. iv. l. 120.
U||   Hunger. It was long before this and ‘famine’ were desynonymized, and
U||   indeed the great famine year is still spoken of in Ireland as ‘the year
U||   of the hunger.’ Still in the main the words are distinguished, ‘famine’
U||   expressing an outward fact, the dearth of food, and ‘hunger’ the inward
U||   sense and experience of this fact.
U||   And aftir that he hadde endid alle thingis, a strong hungre was maad in
U||   that cuntre.—Luke xv. 14. Wiclif.
U||   Pestilences and hungers shall be
U||   And erthedyns in many contré.
U||   Richard Rolle de Hampole, Pricke of Conscience, 4035.
U||   [Pg 140]
U||   Oon of hem roos up, Agabus bi name, and signefiede bi the spirit a
U||   greet hungur to comynge in al the world, which hungur was maad undur
U||   Claudius.—Acts xi. 28. Wiclif.
U||   Behold the tyme commeth that I shal sende an hunger in to the earth;
U||   not the hunger of bread, nor the thyrst of water.—Amos viii. 11.
U||   Coverdale.
U||   Husband. This, the Old Norse ‘hús-bondi,’ is much more nearly the Latin
U||   ‘paterfamilias’ than ‘vir.’ As the house, above all that of him who
U||   owns and tills the soil, stands by a wise and watchful economy, it is
U||   easy to see how ‘husband’ came to signify one who knows how prudently
U||   to spare and save.
U||   All good husbands agree in this, That every work should have the due
U||   and convenient season.—Holland, Pliny, vol. i. p. 556.
U||   They are too good husbands, and too thrifty of God’s grace, too sparing
U||   of the Holy Ghost, that restrain God’s general propositions, Venite
U||   omnes, Let all come, so particularly as to say that when God says all,
U||   he means some.—Donne, Sermon 33.
U||   Thou dost thyself wise and industrious deem;
U||   A mighty husband thou wouldst seem;
U||   Fond man, like a bought slave thou all the while
U||   Dost but for others sweat and toil.
U||   Cowley, The Shortness of Life and Uncertainty of Riches.
U||   After we come once to view the seam or vein where the hidden treasure
U||   lies, we account all we possess besides as dross; for whose further
U||   assurance we alienate all our interest in the world, with as great
U||   willingness as good husbands do base tenements or hard-rented leases,
U||   to compass some goodly royalty offered them more than half for
U||   nothing.—Jackson, The Eternal Truth of the Scriptures, b. iv. c. 8.
U||   Idiot, [Pg 141] }
U||   Idiotical.
U||   A word with a very interesting and instructive history, which, however,
U||   is only fully intelligible by a reference to the Greek. The ἰδιώτης or
U||   ‘idiot’ is first the private man as distinguished from the man
U||   sustaining a public office; then, inasmuch as public life was
U||   considered an absolutely necessary condition of man’s highest
U||   education, the untaught or mentally undeveloped, as distinguished from
U||   the educated; and only after it had run through these courses did
U||   ‘idiot’ come to signify what ἰδιώτης never did, the man whose mental
U||   powers are not merely unexercised but deficient, as distinguished from
U||   him in full possession of them. This is the only employment to which we
U||   now put the word; but examples of its earlier and more Greek uses are
U||   frequent in Jeremy Taylor and others. See my Synonyms of the N.T. § 79.
U||   And here, again, their allegation out of Gregory the First and
U||   Damascene, That images be the laymen’s books, and that pictures are the
U||   Scripture of idiots and simple persons, is worthy to be
U||   considered.—Homilies; Against Perils of Idolatry.
U||   It is clear, by Bellarmine’s confession, that S. Austin affirmed that
U||   the plain places of Scripture are sufficient to all laics, and all
U||   idiots or private persons.—Bishop Taylor, A Dissuasive from Popery,
U||   part ii. b. i. § 1.
U||   Christ was received of idiots, of the vulgar people, and of the simpler
U||   sort, while He was rejected, despised, and persecuted even to death by
U||   the high priests, lawyers, scribes, doctors, and rabbies.—Blount,
U||   Philostratus, p. 237.
U||   It [Scripture] speaks commonly according to vulgar apprehension, as
U||   when it tells of ‘the ends of the heaven;’ which now almost every idiot
U||   knows hath no ends at all.—John Smith, Select Discourses, vi., On
U||   Prophecy.
U||   Truth is content, when it comes into the world, to wear[Pg 142] our
U||   mantles, to learn our language: it speaks to the most idiotical sort of
U||   men in the most idiotical way. The reason of this plain and idiotical
U||   style of Scripture it may be worth our farther taking notice of.—Id.,
U||   ibid.
U||   Ill-nature,  }
U||   Ill-natured.
U||   This is now rather one special evil quality, as κακία is often in
U||   Greek; it was once the complex of all, or more properly the natural
U||   substratum on which they all were superinduced. See ‘Good-nature,’ and,
U||   in addition to the passage from South, quoted below, a very instructive
U||   discussion on both words in his Sermons, 1737, vol. vi. pp. 104-111.
U||   I may truly say of the mind of an ungrateful person, that it is
U||   kindness-proof. It is inpenetrable, unconquerable; unconquerable by
U||   that which conquers all things else, even by love itself. And the
U||   reason is manifest; for you may remember that I told you that
U||   ingratitude sprang from a principle of ill-nature; which being a thing
U||   founded in such a certain constitution of blood and spirit, as being
U||   born with a man into the world, and upon that account called nature,
U||   shall prevent all remedies that can be applied by education.—South,
U||   Sermons, 1737, vol. i. p. 429.
U||   King Henry the Eighth was an ill-natured prince to execute so many whom
U||   he had so highly favoured.—Sir T. Overbury, Crumbs fallen from King
U||   James’ Table.
U||   He is the worst of men, whom kindness cannot soften, nor endearments
U||   oblige; whom gratitude cannot tie faster than the bands of life and
U||   death.—He is an ill-natured sinner.—Bishop Taylor, The Miracles of the
U||   Divine Mercy, serm. 27.
U||   Imp. Employed in nobler senses formerly than now. ‘To imp’ is properly
U||   to engraft, and an ‘imp’ a graft, scion, or young shoot; and, even as
U||   we now speak of the ‘scions’ of a noble house, so there was[Pg 143] in
U||   earlier English the same natural transfer of ‘imps’ from plants to
U||   persons.
U||   I was sum-tyme a frere,
U||   And the coventes gardyner for to graffe ympes.
U||   Piers Plowman, B-text, Passus v. 136 (Skeat).
U||   Of feble trees ther cometh feble ympes.
U||   Chaucer, The Monkes Prologue (Morris, iii. p. 200).
U||   The sudden taking away of those most goodly and virtuous young imps,
U||   the Duke of Suffolk and his brother, by the sweating sickness, was it
U||   not also a manifest token of God’s heavy displeasure towards us?—Becon,
U||   A Comfortable Epistle.
U||   The king returned into England with victory and triumph; the king
U||   preferred there eighty noble imps to the order of knighthood.—Stow,
U||   Annals, 1592, p. 385.
U||   Impotent,  }
U||   Impotence.
U||   The inner connexion between weakness and violence is finely declared in
U||   Latin in the fact that ‘impotens’ and ‘impotentia’ imply both; so once
U||   did ‘impotent’ and ‘impotence’ in English (see Spenser’s Fairy Queen,
U||   ii. 11, 23), though they now retain only the meaning of weak.
U||   An impotent lover
U||   Of women for a flash; but his fires quenched,
U||   Hating as deadly.
U||   Massinger, The Unnatural Combat, act iii. sc. 2.
U||   The Lady Davey, ever impotent in her passions, was even distracted with
U||   anger, that she was crossed in her will.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop
U||   Williams, part i. p. 194.
U||   The truth is, that in this battle and whole business the Britons never
U||   more plainly manifested themselves to be right barbarous; such
U||   confusion, such impotence, as seemed likest not to a war, but to the
U||   wild hurry of a distracted woman, with as mad a crew at her
U||   heels.—Milton, History of England, b. ii.
U||   [Pg 144]
U||   If a great personage undertakes an action passionately and upon great
U||   interest, let him manage it indiscreetly, let the whole design be
U||   unjust, let it be acted with all the malice and impotency in the world,
U||   he shall have enough to flatter him, but not enough to reprove
U||   him.—Bishop Taylor, Holy Living, c. 2, § 6.
U||   Improve. So long as the verb ‘to improve’ was directly connected in
U||   men’s thoughts with the Latin ‘improbare,’ it was inevitable that it
U||   should have a meaning very different from that which now attaches to
U||   it; and so we find it used as equivalent to the Greek ἐλέγχειν, the
U||   Latin ‘reprobare,’ to disapprove of, to disallow.
U||   If tho thre [opinions] be sufficiently improved, that is to saie, if it
U||   be sufficiently schewen that the thre be nought and untrewe and badde,
U||   alle the othere untrewe opiniouns bilded upon hem muste needis therebi
U||   take her fal.—Pecock, Repressor, part 1, c. 1.
U||   For love of the world the olde pharesies blasphemed the Holy Ghost, and
U||   persecuted the manifest truth which they could not improve.—Tyndale,
U||   Exposition on the First Epistle of S. John.
U||   If ye cannot improve it [my doctrine] by God’s word, and yet of an hate
U||   and malicious mind that you bear to the truth, labour to resist it and
U||   condemn it that it should not spread, I ensure you your sin is
U||   irremissible and even against the Holy Ghost.—Frith, Works, 1572, p. 3.
U||   Be instant in season and out of season; improve [ἔλεγξον], rebuke,
U||   exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.—2 Tim. iv. 2. (Geneva
U||   Version.)
U||   Incense. Now to kindle anger only; but once to kindle or inflame any
U||   passion, good or bad, in the breast. Anger, as the strongest passion,
U||   finally appropriated the word, just as in Greek it made θυμός and ὀργή
U||   its own.
U||   [Pg 145]
U||   He [Asdrubal] it was, that when his men were weary and drew back,
U||   incensed [accendit] them again, one while by fair words and entreaty,
U||   another while by sharp checks and rebukes.—Holland, Livy, p. 665.
U||   Prince Edward struck his breast and swore, that though all his friends
U||   forsook him, yet he would enter Ptolemais, though only with Fowin, his
U||   horsekeeper. By which speech he incensed the English to go on with
U||   him.—Fuller, Holy War, b. iv. c. 28.
U||   Incivility. See ‘Civil.’
U||   By this means infinite numbers of souls may be brought from their
U||   idolatry, bloody sacrifices, ignorance, and incivility, to the
U||   worshipping of the true God.—Sir W. Raleigh, Of the Voyage for Guiana.
U||   Incredulous, }
U||   Incredulity.
U||   In Low Latin, and in ages of a blind unintelligent faith, ‘credulitas’
U||   came to be regarded as equivalent to ‘fides,’ and ‘credulity’ to
U||   ‘faith.’ The two latter, with their negatives, ‘incredulity’ and
U||   ‘unbelief,’ have been usefully desynonymized in our later English; but
U||   the quotations which follow will show that this was not always the
U||   case.
U||   For we also were sometime unwise, incredulous, erring, serving divers
U||   lusts and voluptuousnesses.—Tit. iii. 3. Rhemish Version.
U||   And we see that they could not enter in because of incredulity.—Heb.
U||   iii. 19. The same version.
U||   But let us take heed; as God hates a lie, so He hates incredulity, an
U||   obstinate, a foolish, and pertinacious understanding.—Bishop Taylor,
U||   Sermon at the Funeral of the Lord Primate.
U||   Indifferent,   }
U||   Indifference,
U||   Indifferently.
U||   It is a striking testimony of the low general average which we assume
U||   common to most things, that a thing which does not differ from others,
U||   is[Pg 146] therefore qualified as poor; a sentence of depreciation is
U||   pronounced upon it when it is declared to be ‘indifferent.’ When in
U||   Greek διαφέρειν means ‘præstare,’ and τὰ διαφέροντα ‘præstantiora,’ we
U||   have exactly the same feeling embodying itself at the other end. But
U||   this use of these words is modern. ‘Indifferent’ was impartial once,
U||   not making differences where none really were.
U||   God receiveth the learned and unlearned, and casteth away none, but is
U||   indifferent unto all.—Homilies: Exhortation to the Reading of Holy
U||   Scripture.
U||   If overseer of the poor, he [the good parishioner] is careful the rates
U||   be made indifferent, whose inequality oftentimes is more burdensome
U||   than the sum.—Fuller, Holy State, b. ii. c. 11.
U||   Come Sleep, O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,
U||   The baiting place of wit, the balm of woe,
U||   The poor man’s wealth, the prisoner’s release,
U||   The indifferent judge between the high and low.
U||   Sir P. Sidney, Astrophel and Stella, 39.
U||   Requesting that they might speak before the senate, and be heard with
U||   indifference.—Holland, Livy, p. 1214.
U||   That they may truly and indifferently minister justice.—Book of Common
U||   Prayer.
U||   Individual. Properly not capable of division; indivisible, as is an
U||   atom; then, undivided, inseparable, and so used in the quotations which
U||   follow. We, using ‘individual’ as = person, have in fact recurred to
U||   the earlier meaning.
U||   Then long eternity shall greet our bliss
U||   With an individual kiss,
U||   And joy shall overtake us like a flood.
U||   Milton, On Time.
U||   Anacreon,

U||   Holyday, Marriages of the Arts, act ii. sc. 6.
U||   [Pg 147]
U||   Indolence. ‘Indolentia’ was a word first invented by Cicero, when he
U||   was obliged to find some equivalent for the ἀπάθεια of certain Greek
U||   schools. That it was not counted one of his happiest coinages we may
U||   conclude from the seldom use of it by any other authors but himself, as
U||   also from the fact that Seneca, a little later proposing ‘impatientia’
U||   as the Latin equivalent for ἀπάθεια, implied that none such had
U||   hitherto been found. The word has taken firmer root in English than it
U||   ever did in Latin. At the same time, meaning as it does now a
U||   disposition or temper of languid non-exertion, it has lost the accuracy
U||   of use which it had in the philosophical schools, where it signified a
U||   state of freedom from passion and pain; which signification it retained
U||   among our own writers of the Caroline period, and even later. To this
U||   day, indeed, surgeons call certain painless swellings ‘indolent
U||   tumours.’
U||   Now, to begin with fortitude, they say it is the mean between cowardice
U||   and rash audacity, of which twain the one is a defect, the other an
U||   excess of the ireful passion; liberality between niggardise and
U||   prodigality, clemency and mildness between senseless indolence and
U||   cruelty.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 69.
U||   Now though Christ were far from both, yet He came nearer to an excess
U||   of passion than to an indolency, to a senselessness, to a privation of
U||   natural affections. Inordinateness of affections may sometimes make
U||   some men like some beasts; but indolency, absence, emptiness, privation
U||   of affections, makes any man, at all times, like stones, like
U||   dirt.—Donne, Sermons, 1640, p. 156.
U||   The submission here spoken of in the text is not a stupid indolence, or
U||   insensibility under such calamities as God shall be pleased to bring
U||   upon us.—South, Sermons, 1744, vol. x. p. 97.
U||   Ingenious, [Pg 148] }
U||   Ingenuous,
U||   Ingeniously,
U||   Ingenuity,
U||   Ingenuousness.
U||   We are now pretty well agreed in our use of these words; but there was
U||   a time when the uttermost confusion reigned amongst them. Thus, in the
U||   first and second quotations which follow, ‘ingenious’ is used where we
U||   should now use, and where oftentimes the writers of that time would
U||   have used, ‘ingenuous,’ and the converse in the third; while in like
U||   manner ‘ingenuity’ in each of the succeeding three quotations stands
U||   for our present ‘ingenuousness,’ and ‘ingenuousness’ in the last for
U||   ‘ingenuity.’ In respect of ‘ingenious’ and ‘ingenuous,’ the arrangement
U||   at which we have now arrived regarding their several meanings, namely
U||   that the first indicates mental, the second moral qualities, is good;
U||   ‘ingenious’ being from ‘ingenium’ and ‘ingenuous’ from ‘ingenuus.’ But
U||   ‘ingenuity,’ being from ‘ingenuous,’ should have kept the meaning,
U||   which it has now quite let go, of innate nobleness of disposition;
U||   while ‘ingeniousness,’ against which there can be no objection to which
U||   ‘ingenuousness’ is not equally exposed, might have expressed what
U||   ‘ingenuity’ does now.
U||   Now as an ingenious debtor desires his freedom at his creditor’s hands,
U||   that thereby he may be capable of paying his debt, as well as to escape
U||   the misery which himself should endure by his imprisonment; so an
U||   ingenious soul (and such is every saint) deprecates hell, as well with
U||   an eye to God’s glory as to his own ease and happiness.—Gurnall, The
U||   Christian in Complete Armour, part ii. c. 54, § 2.
U||   Here let us breathe and haply institute
U||   A course of learning and ingenious studies.
U||   Shakespeare, Taming of the Shrew, act i. sc. 1.
U||   An ingenious person will rather wear a plain garment of[Pg 149] his own
U||   than a rich livery, the mark of servitude.—Bates, Spiritual Perfection,
U||   Preface.
U||   Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak;
U||   No blame belongs to thee.
U||   Shakespeare, Timon of Athens, act ii. sc. 2.
U||   Since heaven is so glorious a state, and so certainly designed for us,
U||   if we please, let us spend all that we have, all our passions and
U||   affections, all our study and industry, all our desires and stratagems,
U||   all our witty and ingenuous faculties, towards the arriving
U||   thither.—Bishop Taylor, Holy Dying, c. 2, § 4.
U||   Christian simplicity teaches openness and ingenuity in contracts and
U||   matters of buying and selling.—Id., Sermon 24. part ii.
U||   When a man makes use of the name of any simple idea, which he perceives
U||   is not understood, or is in danger to be mistaken, he is obliged by the
U||   laws of ingenuity and the end of speech, to declare his meaning, and
U||   make known what idea he makes it stand for.—Locke, An Essay concerning
U||   Human Understanding, b. iii. c. 11, § 14.
U||   It [gratitude] is such a debt as is left to every man’s ingenuity (in
U||   respect to any legal coaction) whether he will pay it or no.—South,
U||   Sermons, vol. i. p. 410.
U||   By his ingenuousness he [the good handicrafts-man] leaves his art
U||   better than he found it.—Fuller, Holy State, b. ii. c. 19.
U||   Inn. This has always meant a lodging, a place to which one turns in;
U||   but it is now, and for a long time has been, restricted to one which
U||   yields food and shelter, or it may be only the last, in return for
U||   payment. Such terms as Lincoln’s Inn, Gray’s Inn, attest the older use
U||   of the word.
U||   Arcite anoon unto his inne is fare,
U||   As fayn as foul is of the brighte sonne.
U||   Chaucer, Knightes Tale, 1578 (Morris, ii. p. 75).
U||   [Pg 150]
U||   The honey-makers’ busy buzzing swarm
U||   Fiercely assail and wound the naked skins
U||   Of such as come to rob their curious inns.
U||   Sylvester, Du Bartas, his Divine Works,
U||   The Capitaine, 369.
U||   Insolent,  }
U||   Insolence.
U||   The ‘insolent’ is properly no more than the unusual. This, as the
U||   violation of the fixed law and order of society, is commonly offensive,
U||   even as it indicates a mind willing to offend; and thus ‘insolent’ has
U||   acquired its present meaning. But for the poet, the fact that he is
U||   forsaking the beaten track, that he can say,
U||   ‘peragro loca, nullius ante
U||   Trita solo,’
U||   in this way to be ‘insolent’ or original, as we should now say, may be
U||   his highest praise. The epithet ‘furious’ joined to ‘insolence’ in the
U||   second quotation is to be explained of that ‘fine madness’ which
U||   Spenser as a Platonist esteemed a necessary condition of the poet.
U||   For ditty and amorous ode I find Sir Walter Raleigh’s vein most lofty,
U||   insolent, and passionate.—Puttenham, Art of English Poesy, b. i. c. 3.
U||   Her great excellence
U||   Lifts me above the measure of my might,
U||   That, being fild with furious insolence,
U||   I feele myselfe like one yrapt in spright.
U||   Spenser, Colin Clout’s come Home again, 619
U||   (Morris, v. p. 105).
U||   Institute,   }
U||   Instituter,
U||   Institution.
U||   These all had once in English meanings coextensive with those of the
U||   Latin words which they represent. We now inform, instruct (the images
U||   are[Pg 151] nearly the same), but we do not ‘institute,’ children any
U||   more.
U||   A painful schoolmaster, that hath in hand
U||   To institute the flower of all a land,
U||   Gives longest lessons unto those, where Heaven
U||   The ablest wits and aptest wills hath given.
U||   Sylvester, Du Bartas; Seventh Day of the First Week.

U||   learnedest and wisest man reputed of all Britain, the instituter of his
U||   youth.—Milton, History of England, b. iii.
U||   A Short Catechism for the institution of young persons in the Christian
U||   Religion.—Title of a Treatise by Jeremy Taylor.
U||   Intend,    }
U||   Intention.
U||   The inveterate habit of procrastination has brought us to say now that
U||   we ‘intend’ a thing, when we mean hereafter to do it. Our fathers with
U||   a more accurate use of the word ‘intended’ that which they were at that
U||   moment actually and earnestly engaged in doing. The same habit of
U||   procrastination has made ‘by-and-bye’ mean not straightway, but at a
U||   comparatively remote period; and ‘presently’ not at this present, but
U||   in a little while. ‘Intention’ too, or ‘intension,’ for Jeremy Taylor
U||   in the same work spells the word both ways, was once something not
U||   future but present.
U||   The Devil sleepeth not. He ever intendeth to withdraw us from
U||   prayer.—Latimer, Sermons, vol. i. p. 342.
U||   So often as he [Augustus] was at them [the games], he did nothing else
U||   but intend the same.—Holland, Suetonius, p. 60.
U||   [Pg 152]
U||   He [Lord Bacon] saw plainly that natural philosophy hath been intended
U||   by few persons, and in them hath occupied the least part of their
U||   time.—Bacon, Filum Labyrinthi, 6.
U||   It is so plain that every man profiteth in that he most intendeth, that
U||   it needeth not to be stood upon.—Id., Essays, 29.
U||   I suffer for their guilt now, and my soul,
U||   Like one that looks on ill-affected eyes,
U||   Is hurt with mere intention on their follies.
U||   Ben Jonson, Cynthia’s Revels.
U||   But did you not
U||   Observe with what intention the duke
U||   Set eyes on Domitilla?
U||   Shirley, The Royal Master, act ii. sc. 1.
U||   According as we neglect meditation, so are our prayers imperfect;
U||   meditation being the soul of prayer, and the intention of our
U||   spirit.—Bishop Taylor, Life of Christ, part i. § 5.
U||   Jacobin. The great French Revolution has stamped itself too deeply and
U||   terribly upon the mind of Europe for ‘Jacobin’ ever again to have any
U||   other meaning than that which the famous Club, assembling in the hall
U||   of the Jacobin convent, has given it; but it needs hardly to say that a
U||   ‘Jacobin’ was once a Dominican friar, though this name did not extend
U||   beyond France.
U||   Now am I yonge, stoute and bolde,
U||   Now am I Robert, now Robyn,
U||   Now frere menour, now jacobyn.
U||   Romaunt of the Rose, 6339 (Morris, vi. p. 193).
U||   Agent for England, send thy mistress word,
U||   What this detested Jacobin hath done.
U||   Marlowe, The Massacre at Paris, act iii. sc. 4.
U||   [Pg 153]
U||   A certain Jacobin offered himself to the fire to prove that Savonarola
U||   had true revelations, and was no heretic.—Bishop Taylor, The Liberty of
U||   Prophesying, The Epistle Dedicatory.
U||   Jolly. For a long time after its adoption into the English language,
U||   ‘jolly’ kept the meaning of beautiful, which it brought with it from
U||   the French, and which ‘joli’ in French still retains.
U||   Then sete thei thre to solas hem at the windowe,
U||   Even over the joly place that to that paleis longed.
U||   William of Palerne, 5478.
U||   I know myself to be
U||   A jolly fellow: for even now I did behold and see
U||   Mine image in the water sheer, and sure methought I took

U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. 13.
U||   When all the glorious realm of pure delight,
U||   Illustrious Paradise, waited on the feet
U||   Of jolly Eve.
U||   Beaumont, Psyche, iv. 4.
U||   Kindly. Nothing ethical was connoted in ‘kindly’ once; it was simply
U||   the adjective of ‘kind.’ But it is God’s ordinance that ‘kind’ should
U||   be ‘kindly,’ in our modern sense of the word as well; and thus the word
U||   has attained this meaning. See ‘Unkind.’
U||   This Joon in the Gospel witnesseth that the kyndeli sone of God is maad
U||   man.—Wiclif, Prologe of John.
U||   Forasmuch as his mind gave him, that, his nephews living, men would not
U||   reckon that he could have right to the realm, he thought therefore
U||   without delay to rid them, as though the killing of his kinsmen could
U||   amend his cause, and make him a kindly king.—Sir T. More, History of
U||   King Richard III.
U||   [Pg 154]
U||   The royal eagle is called in Greek Gnesios, as one would say, true and
U||   kindly, as descended from the gentle and right aëry of eagles.—Holland,
U||   Pliny, vol. i. p. 272.
U||   Whatsoever as the Son of God He may do, it is kindly for Him as the Son
U||   of Man to save the sons of men.—Andrewes, Sermons, vol. iv. p. 253.
U||   Where are they? Gone to their own place, to Judas their brother; and,
U||   as is most kindly, the sons, to the father, of wickedness, there to be
U||   plagued with him for ever.—Id., Of the Conspiracy of the Gowries, serm.
U||   4.
U||   What greater tyranny and usurpation over poor souls would he have than
U||   is now exercised, since the perjured prelates, the kindly brood of the
U||   Man of sin, have defiled and burdened our poor Church?—Jus Populi
U||   Vindicatum, 1665.
U||   Knave. How many serving-lads must have been unfaithful and dishonest
U||   before ‘knave,’ which meant at first no more than boy, acquired the
U||   meaning which it has now! Note the same history in the German ‘Bube,’
U||   ‘Dirne,’ ‘Schalk,’ and see ‘Varlet.’
U||   If it is a knave child, sle ye him; if it is a womman, kepe ye.—Exodus
U||   i. 16. Wiclif.
U||   The tyme is come, a knave childe sche bere.
U||   Chaucer, The Man of Lawes Tale (Morris, ii. p. 192).
U||   O murderous slumber,
U||   Lay’st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
U||   That plays thee music? gentle knave, good night.
U||   Shakespeare, Julius Cæsar, act iv. sc. 3.
U||   Knuckle. The German ‘Knöchel’ is any joint whatsoever; nor was our
U||   ‘knuckle’ limited formerly, as now it well nigh exclusively is, at
U||   least in regard of the human body, to certain smaller joints of the
U||   hand.
U||   [Pg 155]
U||   Thou, Nilus, wert assigned to stay her pains and travels past,
U||   To which as soon as Io came with much ado, at last,
U||   With weary knuckles on thy brim she kneeled sadly down.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. 1.
U||   But when
U||   ‘his scornful muse could ne’er abide
U||   With tragic shoes her ancles for to hide,’
U||   the pace of the verse told me that her maukin knuckles were never
U||   shapen to that royal buskin.—Milton, Apology for Smectymnuus, p. 186.
U||   Lace. That which now commonly bears this name has it on the score of
U||   its curiously woven threads; but ‘lace,’ Old French ‘las,’ ‘laqs,’
U||   identical with the Latin ‘laqueus,’ is commonly used by our earlier
U||   writers in the more original sense of a noose.
U||   And in my Mynde I measure pace by pace,
U||   To seeke the place where I myself had lost,
U||   That day that I was tangled in the lace
U||   In seemyng slacke that knitted ever most.
U||   Earl of Surrey, The Restless State of a Lover, p. 2 (ed. 1717).
U||   Yet if the polype can get and entangle him [the lobster] once within
U||   his long laces, he dies for it.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 973.
U||   Landscape. The second syllable in ‘landscape’ or ‘landskip’ is only a
U||   Dutch example of an earlier form of the same termination which we meet
U||   in ‘friendship,’ ‘lordship,’ ‘fellowship,’ and the like. As these mean
U||   the manner or fashion of a friend, of a lord, and so on, so ‘landscape’
U||   the manner or fashion of the land; and in our earlier English this
U||   rather as the pictured or otherwise counterfeited model, than in its
U||   very self. As this imitation would be necessarily in small, the word
U||   acquired the secondary meaning of a compendium or multum in parvo;
U||   cf.[Pg 156] Skinner, Etymologicon, s. v. Landskip: Tabula
U||   chorographica, primario autem terra, provincia, seu topographica,
U||   σκιαγραφία; Phillips, New World of Words, s. v.; and Earle, Philology
U||   of the English Tongue, § 327, who suggests that the word has been
U||   borrowed by us from the Dutch painters, which would account for the
U||   termination ‘-scape,’ ‘-skip’ instead of the native suffix ‘-ship.’ See
U||   Skeat’s Dictionary.
U||   The sins of other women show in landskip, far off and full of shadow;
U||   her [a harlot’s] in statue, near hand and bigger in the life.—Sir
U||   Thomas Overbury, Characters.
U||   London, as you know, is our Ἑλλάδος Ἑλλάς, our England of England, and
U||   our landskip and representation of the whole island.—Hacket, Life of
U||   Archbishop Williams, part ii. p. 59.
U||   The detestable traitor, that prodigy of nature, that opprobrium of
U||   mankind, that landscape of iniquity, that sink of sin, and that
U||   compendium of baseness, who now calls himself our Protector.—Address
U||   sent by the Anabaptists to the King, 1658, in Clarendon’s History of
U||   the Rebellion, b. xv.
U||   Latch. Few things now are ‘latched’ or caught except a door or
U||   casement; but the word was formerly of much wider use. It is the O.E.
U||   lœccan.
U||   Those that remained threw darts at our men, and latching our darts,
U||   sent them again at us.—Golding, Cæsar, p. 60.
U||   Peahens are wont to lay by night, and that from an high place where
U||   they perch; and then, unless there be good heed taken that the eggs be
U||   latched in some soft bed underneath, they are soon broken.—Holland,
U||   Pliny, vol. i. p. 301.
U||   Lecture. Where words like ‘lecture’ and ‘reading’ exist side by side,
U||   it is very usual for one after a while to be appropriated to the doing
U||   of the thing, the other to the thing which is done. So it has been
U||   here; but they were once synonymous.
U||   [Pg 157]
U||   After the lecture of the law and of the prophets, the rulers of the
U||   synagogue sent unto them, saying, Good brethren, if ye have any sermon
U||   to exhort the people, say on.—Acts xiii. 15. Coverdale.
U||   That may be gathered out of Plutarch’s writings, out of those
U||   especially where he speaketh of the lecture of the poets.—North,
U||   Plutarch’s Lives, p. 982.
U||   In my lecture I often perceive how my authors commend examples for
U||   magnanimity and force, that rather proceed from a thick skin and
U||   hardness of the bones.—Florio, Montaigne’s Essays, p. 72.
U||   Legacy. This now owns no relation except with ‘lēgatum,’ which meant in
U||   juristic Latin a portion of the inheritance by testamentary disposition
U||   withdrawn from the heir, and bestowed upon some other. It was formerly
U||   used as a derivative of ‘legatus,’ ambassador, in the sense of
U||   embassage.
U||   They were then preaching bishops, and more often seen in pulpits than
U||   in princes’ palaces: more often occupied in his legacy, who said, Go ye
U||   into the whole world and preach the gospel to all men, than in
U||   embassages and affairs of princes.—Homilies, Against Peril of Idolatry.
U||   Otherwise, while he is yet far off, sending a legacy, he asketh those
U||   things that belong to peace.—Luke xiv. 32. Rheims.
U||   And his citizens hated him, and they sent a legacie after him, saying,
U||   We will not have this man to reign over us.—Luke xix. 14. Ibid.
U||   Levy. Troops are now raised, or ‘levied,’ indifferently: but a siege is
U||   only raised, and not ‘levied,’ as it too once might have been.
U||   Euphranor having levied the siege from this one city, forthwith led his
U||   army to Demetrias.—Holland, Livy, p. 1178.
U||   Lewd, [Pg 158] }
U||   Lewdly,
U||   Lewdness.
U||   There are three distinct stages in the meaning of the word ‘lewd;’ of
U||   these it has entirely overlived two, and survives only in the third,
U||   namely in that of wanton or lascivious. Without discussing here its
U||   etymology or its exact relation to ‘lay,’ it is sufficient to observe,
U||   that, as ‘lay,’ it was often used in the sense of ignorant, or rather
U||   unlearned. Next, according to the proud saying of the Pharisees, ‘This
U||   people who knoweth not the law are cursed’ (John vii. 49), and on the
U||   assumption, which would have its truth, that those untaught in the
U||   doctrines, would be unexercised in the practices, of Christianity, it
U||   came to signify vicious, though without designating one vice more than
U||   others. While in its present and third stage, it has, like so many
U||   other words, retired from this general designation of all vices, to
U||   express one of the more frequent, alone.
U||   Archa-Dei in the olde law Levites it kepten;
U||   Hadde nevere lewed man leve to leggen honde on that chest.
U||   Piers Plowman, B-text, Passus xii. 115 (Skeat).
U||   For as moche as the curatis ben often so lewed, that thei understonden
U||   not bookis of Latyn for to teche the peple, it is spedful not only to
U||   the lewed peple, but also to the lewed curatis, to have bookis in
U||   Englisch of needful loore to the lewed people.—Wycliffe Mss., p. 5.
U||   Of sondry thoughtes thus they jangle and trete
U||   As lewed peple demeth comunly

U||   Than they can in her lewdenes comprehende.

U||   Joon was a lewde fischere and untaught in scolys.—Purvey, Preface to
U||   Epistles of St. Jerome, p. 65.
U||   Neither was it Christ’s intention that there should be any thing in it
U||   [the Lord’s Prayer] dark or far from our[Pg 159] capacity, specially
U||   since it belongeth equally to all, and is as necessary for the lewd as
U||   the learned.—A Short Catechism, 1553.
U||   This is servitude,
U||   To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled
U||   Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
U||   Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled,
U||   Yet lewdly darest our ministering upbraid.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, vi. 178.
U||   If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness [ῥᾳδιούργημα], O ye
U||   Jews, reason would that I should bear with you.—Acts xviii. 14. (A.V.)
U||   Liberal. Often used by Shakespeare and his contemporaries as free of
U||   tongue, licentious or wanton in speech.
U||   There with fantastic garlands did she come,
U||   Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
U||   That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
U||   But our cold maids do dead-men’s-fingers call them.
U||   Shakespeare, Hamlet, act iv. sc. 7.
U||   Desdemona [of Iago]: Is he not a most profane and liberal
U||   counsellor?—Id., Othello, act ii. sc. 1.
U||   But that we know thee, Wyatt, to be true,
U||   Thy overboldness should be paid with death;
U||   But cease, for fear your liberal tongue offend.
U||   Webster, The Famous History of Sir Thomas Wyatt.
U||   Libel. This, properly a little book, is with us any defamatory speech
U||   or writing; but was not formerly so restricted; indeed, in the legal
U||   language of Scotland, where an indictment is in technical language a
U||   ‘libel,’ it still retains a wider meaning.
U||   Forsoothe, it is said, Who evere shal leeve his wyf, geve he to hir a
U||   libel.—Matt. v. 31. Wiclif.[Pg 160]
U||   Let the Allmightie geve me answere, and let him that is my contrary
U||   party sue me with a lybell.—Job xxxi. 35. Coverdale.
U||   Here is a libel too accusing Cæsar,
U||   From Lucius Vectius, and confirmed by Curius.
U||   Ben Jonson, Catiline, act v. sc. 4.
U||   Libertine. A striking evidence of the extreme likelihood that he who
U||   has no restraints on his belief will ere long have none upon his life,
U||   is given by this word ‘libertine.’ Applied at first to certain
U||   heretical sects, and intended to mark the licentious liberty of their
U||   creed, ‘libertine’ soon let go altogether its relation to what a man
U||   believed, and acquired the sense which it now has, a ‘libertine’ being
U||   one who has released himself from all moral restraints, and especially
U||   in his relations with the other sex.
U||   That the Scriptures do not contain in them all things necessary to
U||   salvation, is the fountain of many great and capital errors; I instance
U||   in the whole doctrine of the libertines, familists, quakers, and other
U||   enthusiasts, which issue from this corrupted fountain.—Bishop Taylor, A
U||   Dissuasive from Popery, part ii. b. 1, § 2.
U||   It is not to be denied that the said libertine doctrines do more
U||   contradict the doctrine of the Gospel, even Christianity itself, than
U||   the doctrines of the Papists about the same subjects do.—Baxter,
U||   Catholic Theology, part iii. p. 289.
U||   It is too probable that our modern libertines, deists, and atheists,
U||   took occasion from the scandalous contentions of Christians about many
U||   things, to disbelieve all.—A Discourse of Logomachies, 1711.
U||   Litigious. This word has changed from an objective to a subjective
U||   sense. Things were ‘litigious’ once, which offered matter for going to
U||   law; persons are ‘litigious’ now, who are prone to going to law.[Pg
U||   161] Both meanings are to be found in the Latin ‘litigiosus,’ though
U||   predominantly that which we have now made the sole meaning.
U||   Dolopia he hath subdued by force of arms, and could not abide to hear
U||   that the determination of certain provinces, which were debatable and
U||   litigious, should be referred to the award of the people of
U||   Rome.—Holland, Livy, p. 1111.
U||   Of the articles gainsaid by a great outcry, three and no more did seem
U||   to be litigious.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part i. p. 140.
U||   No fences parted fields, nor marks nor bounds
U||   Distinguished acres of litigious grounds.
U||   Dryden, Virgil’s Georgics, b. i. 193, 4.
U||   Lively. This had once nearly, if not altogether, the same meaning as
U||   ‘living.’ We have here the explanation of a circumstance which many
U||   probably have noted and regretted in the Authorized Version of the New
U||   Testament, namely that while λίθον ζῶντα at 1 Pet. ii. 4 is ‘a living
U||   stone,’ λίθοι ζῶντες, which follows immediately, ver. 5, is only
U||   ‘lively stones,’ ‘living’ being thus brought down to ‘lively’ with no
U||   correspondent reduction in the original to warrant it. But when our
U||   Version was made, there was scarcely any distinction between the forces
U||   of the words. Still it would certainly have been better to adhere to
U||   one word or the other.
U||   Mine enemies are lively (Heb. living), and they are strong.—Ps.
U||   xxxviii. 19. (A.V.)
U||   Was it well done to suffer him, imprisoned in chains, lying in a dark
U||   dungeon, to draw his lively breath at the pleasure of the
U||   hangman?—Holland, Livy, p. 228.
U||   Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
U||   It would have madded me; what shall I do
U||   Now I behold thy lively body so?
U||   Shakespeare, Titus Andronicus, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   That his dear father might interment have,
U||   [Pg 162]
U||   See, the young man entered a lively grave.
U||   Massinger, The Fatal Dowry, act ii. sc. 1.
U||   Livery. It need hardly be observed that the explanation of ‘livery’
U||   which Spenser offers (see below) is perfectly correct; but we do not
U||   any longer recognize the second of those uses of the word there
U||   mentioned by him. It is no longer applied to the ration, or stated
U||   portion of food, delivered at stated periods (the σιτομέτριον of Luke
U||   xii. 42), either to the members of a household, to soldiers, or to
U||   others.
U||   To bed they busked them anon,
U||   Their liveryes were served them up soone,
U||   With a merry cheer.
U||   Ballad of John de Reeve, 155.
U||   What Liverye is, we by common use in England knowe well enough,
U||   namelye, that it is, allowaunce of horse-meate, as they commonly use
U||   the woord in stabling, as to keepe horses at liverye, the which woord,
U||   I gess, is derived of livering or delivering foorth theyr nightlye
U||   foode. Soe in great howses the liverye is sayd to be served up for all
U||   night. And Liverye is also called the upper garment which serving-men
U||   weareth, soe called (as I suppose) for that it is delivered and taken
U||   from him at pleasure.—Spenser, View of the State of Ireland, p. 623
U||   (Globe edition).
U||   The emperor’s officers every night went through the town from house to
U||   house, whereat any English gentleman did repast or lodge, and served
U||   their liveries for all night; first the officers brought into the house
U||   a cast of fine manchet, and of silver two great pots, and white wine,
U||   and sugar, to the weight of a pound, &c.—Cavendish, Life of Cardinal
U||   Wolsey.
U||   Loiter,   }
U||   Loiterer.
U||   Whatever may be the derivation of ‘to loiter,’[290]17 it is certain
U||   that it[Pg 163] formerly implied a great deal more and worse than it
U||   implies now. The ‘loiterer’ then was very much what the tramp is now.
U||   God bad that no such strong lubbers should loyter and goe a begging,
U||   and be chargeable to the congregation.—Tyndale, Works, p. 217.
U||   He that giveth any alms to an idle beggar robbeth the truly poor; as S.
U||   Ambrose sometimes complaineth that the maintenance of the poor is made
U||   the spoil of the loiterer.—Sanderson, Sermons, 1671. vol. i. p. 198.
U||   Yf he be but once taken soe idlye roging, he [the Provost Marshal] may
U||   punnish him more lightlye, as with stockes or such like; but yf he be
U||   founde agayne soe loytring he may scourge him with whippes or roddes;
U||   after which yf he be agayne taken, lett him have the bitterness of the
U||   marshall lawe.—Spenser, View of the State of Ireland, p. 679 (Globe
U||   Edition).
U||   They spend their youth in loitering, bezzling, and harlotting.—Milton,
U||   Animadversions on Remonstrants’ Defence.
U||   Lover. This word has undergone two restrictions, of which formerly it
U||   knew nothing. A natural delicacy, and an unwillingness to confound
U||   under a common name things essentially different, has caused ‘lover’ no
U||   longer to be equivalent with friend, but always to imply a relation
U||   resting on the difference of sex; while further, and within these
U||   narrower limits, the ‘lover’ now is always the man, not as once the man
U||   or the woman indifferently. We may still indeed speak of ‘a pair of
U||   lovers,’ but then datur denominatio a potiori. ‘Leman’ had something of
U||   the same history, though that history ended in leaving this a
U||   designation of the woman alone.
U||   If ye love them that love you, what thank have ye therefore? for
U||   sinners also love their lovers.—Luke vi. 32. Coverdale.[Pg 164]
U||   For Hiram was ever a lover of David.—1 Kin. v. 1. (A.V.)
U||   This Posthumus,
U||   Most like a noble lord in love, and one
U||   That had a royal lover, took his hint.
U||   Shakespeare, Cymbeline, act v. sc. 5.
U||   If I freely may discover
U||   What would please me in a lover,
U||   I would have her fair and witty,
U||   Savouring more of court than city.
U||   Ben Jonson, The Poetaster.
U||   Lucid interval. We limit this at present to the brief and transient
U||   season when a mind, ordinarily clouded and obscured by insanity,
U||   recovers for a while its clearness. It had no such limitation formerly,
U||   but was of very wide use, as the four passages quoted below, in each of
U||   which its application is different, will show.[291]18
U||   [Pg 165]
U||   East of Edom lay the land of Uz, where Job dwelt, so renowned for his
U||   patience, when the devil heaped afflictions upon him, allowing him no
U||   lucid intervals.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. iv. c. 2.
U||   Some beams of wit on other souls may fall,
U||   Strike through, and make a lucid interval:
U||   But Shadwell’s genuine night admits no ray,
U||   His rising fogs prevail upon the day.
U||   Dryden, Mac-Flecknoe.
U||   Such is the nature of man, that it requires lucid intervals; and the
U||   vigour of the mind would flag and decay, should it always jog on at the
U||   rate of a common enjoyment, without being sometimes quickened and
U||   exalted with the vicissitude of some more refined pleasures.—South,
U||   Sermons, 1744, vol. viii. p. 403.
U||   Thus he [Lord Lyttelton] continued, giving his dying benediction to all
U||   around him. On Monday morning a lucid interval gave some small hopes;
U||   but these vanished in the evening.—Narrative of the Physician, inserted
U||   in Johnson’s Life of Lord Lyttelton.
U||   Lumber. As the Lombards were the bankers, so also they were the
U||   pawnbrokers of the Middle Ages; indeed, as they would often advance
U||   money upon pledges, the two businesses were very closely joined, would
U||   often run in, to one another. The ‘lumber’ room was originally the
U||   Lombard room, or room where the Lombard banker and broker stowed away
U||   his pledges; ‘lumber’ then, as in the passage from Butler, the pawns
U||   and pledges themselves. As these would naturally often accumulate here
U||   till they became out of date and unserviceable, the steps are easy to
U||   be traced by which the word came to possess its present meaning.
U||   Lumber, potius lumbar, as to put one’s clothes to lumbar, i.e. pignori
U||   dare, oppignorare.—Skinner, Etymologicon.
U||   [Pg 166]
U||   And by an action falsely laid of trover
U||   The lumber for their proper goods recover.
U||   Butler, Upon Critics.
U||   They put up all the little plate they had in the lumber, which is
U||   pawning it, till the ships came.—Lady Murray, Lives of George Baillie
U||   and of Lady Grisell Baillie.
U||   Lurch. ‘To lurch’ is seldom used now except of a ship, which ‘lurches’
U||   when it makes something of a headlong dip in the sea; the fact that by
U||   so doing it, partially at least, hides itself, and so ‘lurks,’ explains
U||   this employment of the word. But ‘to lurch,’ generally as an active
U||   verb, was of much more frequent use in early English; and soon
U||   superinduced on the sense of lying concealed that of lying in wait with
U||   the view of intercepting and seizing a prey. After a while this
U||   superadded notion of intercepting and seizing some booty quite thrust
U||   out that of lying concealed; as in all three of the quotations which
U||   follow. See Skeat’s Dictionary.
U||   It is not an auspicate beginning of a feast, nor agreeable to amity and
U||   good fellowship, to snatch or lurch one from another, to have many
U||   hands in a dish at once, striving a vie who should be more nimble with
U||   his fingers.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 679.
U||   I speak not of many more [discommodities of a residence]: too far off
U||   from great cities, which may hinder business; or too near them, which
U||   lurcheth all provisions, and maketh every thing dear.—Bacon, Essays, 45
U||   (ed. Abbott, ii. p. 50).
U||   At the beginning of this war [the Crusades] the Pope’s temporal power
U||   in Italy was very slender; but soon after he grew within short time
U||   without all measure, and did lurch a castle here, gain a city there
U||   from the emperor, while he was employed in Palestine.—Fuller, Holy War,
U||   b. i. c. 11.
U||   [Pg 167]
U||   Lust. Used at this present only in an ill sense, not as ἐπιθυμία, but
U||   as ἐπιθυμία κακή (Col. iii. 5), and this mainly in one particular
U||   direction. ‘Lust’ had formerly no such limitations, nor has it now in
U||   German. The same holds good of the verb.
U||   Of prikyng and of huntyng for the hare
U||   Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.
U||   Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, 192.
U||   Through faith a man is purged of his sins, and obtaineth lust unto the
U||   law of God.—Tyndale, Prologue upon the Epistle to the Romans.
U||   It was not because of the multitude of you above all nations that the
U||   Lord had lust unto you and chose you.—Deut. vii. 7. Coverdale.
U||   My lust to devotion is little, my joy none at all.—Bishop Hall,
U||   Letters, Dec. 2, Ep. 1.
U||   Thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul
U||   lusteth after.—Deut. xii. 15. (A.V.)
U||   Luxury,    }
U||   Luxurious.
U||   ‘Luxuria’ in classical Latin was very much what our ‘luxury’ is now.
U||   The meaning which in our earlier English was its only one, namely
U||   indulgence in sins of the flesh, it derived from the use of ‘luxuria’
U||   in the medieval ethics, where it never means anything else but this.
U||   The weakening of the influence of the scholastic theology, joined to a
U||   more familiar acquaintance with classical Latinity, has probably caused
U||   its return to the classical meaning. In the definition given by
U||   Phillips (see below), we note the process of transition from its old
U||   meaning to its new, the old still remaining, but the new superinduced
U||   upon it.
U||   O foule luste, O luxurie, lo thin ende!
U||   Nought oonly that thou feyntest mannes mynde,
U||   But verrayly thou wolt his body schende.
U||   Chaucer, The Man of Lawes Tale (Morris, ii. p. 198).
U||   [Pg 168]
U||   Luxury and lust fasten a rust and foulness on the mind, that it cannot
U||   see sin in its odious deformity, nor virtue in its unattainable
U||   beauty.—Bates, Spiritual Perfection, c. 1.
U||   Luxury, all superfluity and excess in carnal pleasures, sumptuous fare
U||   or building; sensuality, riotousness, profuseness.—Phillips, New World
U||   of Words.
U||   She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.
U||   Shakespeare, Much Ado about Nothing, act iv. sc. 1.
U||   Again, that many of their Popes be such as I have said, naughty,
U||   wicked, luxurious men, they openly confess.—Jackson, The Eternal Truth
U||   of Scriptures, b. ii. c. 14.
U||   Magnificent,  }
U||   Magnificence.
U||   Frequently used by our elder writers where we should employ munificent
U||   or generous. Yet there lay in the word something more than in these;
U||   something of the μεγαλοπρέπεια of Aristotle; a certain grandeur
U||   presiding over and ordering this large distribution of wealth. Behind
U||   both uses an earlier and a nobler than either may be traced, as is
U||   evident from my first quotation.
U||   Then cometh magnificence, that is to say when a man doth and performeth
U||   gret werkes of goodnesse.—Chaucer, The Persones Tale.
U||   Every amorous person becometh liberal and magnificent, although he had
U||   been aforetime a pinching snudge; in such sort as men take more
U||   pleasure to give away and bestow upon those whom they love, than they
U||   do take and receive of others.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 1147.
U||   Am I close-handed,
U||   Because I scatter not among you that
U||   I must not call my own? know, you court-leeches,
U||   A prince is never so magnificent
U||   As when he’s sparing to enrich a few
U||   With the injuries of many.
U||   Massinger, The Emperor of the East, act ii. sc. 1.
U||   [Pg 169]
U||   Bounty and magnificence are virtues very regal; but a prodigal king is
U||   nearer a tyrant than a parsimonious.—Bacon, Essays, Of a King.
U||   Maid. A word which, in its highest sense as = virgin, might once be
U||   applied to either sex, to Sir Galahad as freely as to the Pucelle, but
U||   which is now restricted to one. Compare παρθένος in Greek.
U||   To him [John the Apostle] God hangyng in the cross bitook his modir,
U||   that a mayde schulde kepe a mayde.—Wiclif, Prolog of John.
U||   I wot wel that thapostil was a mayde;
U||   But natheles, though that he wrot or sayde
U||   He wold that every wight were such as he,
U||   All nys but counseil to virginité.
U||   Chaucer, Prologe of the Wyf of Bathe, 79.
U||   Sir Galahad is a maid and sinner never; and that is the cause he shall
U||   achieve where he goeth that ye nor none such shall not attain.—Sir T.
U||   Malory, Morte D’Arthur, b. xiii. c. 16.
U||   Make,  }
U||   Maker.
U||   The very early use of ‘maker,’ as equivalent to poet, and ‘to make’ as
U||   applied to the exercise of the poet’s art, is evidence that the words
U||   are of genuine home-growth, and not mere imitations of the Greek
U||   ποιητής and ποιεῖν, which Sir Philip Sidney, as will be seen below,
U||   suggests as possible. The words, like the French ‘trouvère’ and
U||   ‘troubadour,’ the O.H.G. ‘scof,’ and the O.E. ‘sceop,’ mark men’s sense
U||   that invention, and in a certain sense, creation, is the essential
U||   character of the poet. The quotation from Chaucer will sufficiently
U||   prove how entirely mistaken Sir John Harington was, when he affirmed
U||   (Apology for Poetry, p. 2) that Puttenham in his Art of English Poesy,
U||   1589, was the first who[Pg 170] gave ‘make’ and ‘maker’ this meaning.
U||   Sir Walter Scott somewhere claims them as Scotticisms; but exclusively
U||   such they certainly are not.
U||   And eke to me hit is a greet penaunce,
U||   Sith rym in English hath swich scarsitee,
U||   To folowe word by word the curiositee
U||   Of Graunson, flour of hem that make in Fraunce.
U||   Chaucer, Compleynt of Venus, 79 (Skeat).
U||   The God of shepherds, Tityrus, is dead,
U||   Who taught me homely, as I can, to make.
U||   Spenser, The Shepherd’s Calendar, June.
U||   The old famous poete Chaucer, for his excellencie and wonderful skil in
U||   making, his scholler Lidgate (a worthy scholler of so excellent a
U||   maister) calleth the Loadestarre of our language.—E. K., Epistle
U||   Dedicatory to Spenser’s Shepherd’s Calendar.
U||   There cannot be in a maker a fouler fault than to falsify his accent to
U||   serve his cadence, or by untrue orthography to wrench his words to help
U||   his rhyme.—Puttenham, Art of English Poesy, b. ii. c. 8.
U||   The Greeks named the poet ποιητής, which name, as the most excellent,
U||   hath gone through other languages. It cometh of this word ποιεῖν, to
U||   make; wherein I know not whether by luck or wisdom we Englishmen have
U||   met well with the Greeks in calling him a maker.—Sir P. Sidney, Defence
U||   of Poesy.
U||   Mansion. This is a finely selected word, suggested no doubt by the
U||   ‘mansiones’ of the Vulgate, whereby our Translators, and Tyndale before
U||   them, rendered the μοναί of John xiv. 2. Knowing, however, as we do
U||   that μοναί never meant ‘mansions’ in our modern, or auctioneers’ sense
U||   of the word, we cannot doubt that by this word they intended places of
U||   tarrying, which might be for a longer or a shorter time; resting places
U||   which remained for the Christian traveller[Pg 171] who should have
U||   reached at length his heavenly home. This use of ‘mansion’ as a place
U||   of tarrying is frequent enough in our early literature, although our
U||   modern use is by no means unknown.
U||   They [the Angels] be pure minds and were never neither blinded through
U||   sin, ne hindered through any earthly mansion and corruptible
U||   body.—Hutchinson, Works, p. 160 (ed. 1842).
U||   Before the starry threshold of Jove’s court
U||   My mansion is, where those immortal shapes
U||   Of bright aerial spirits live unsphered,
U||   In regions mild of calm and serene air.
U||   Milton, Comus, i. 4.
U||   Manure. The same word as ‘manœuvre,’ to work with the hand; and thus,
U||   to till or cultivate the earth, this tillage being in earlier periods
U||   of society the great and predominant labour of the hands. We restrain
U||   the word now to one particular branch of this cultivation, but our
U||   ancestors made it to embrace the whole.
U||   The manuring hand of the tiller shall root up all that burdens the
U||   soil.—Milton, Reason of Church Government.
U||   It [Japan] is mountainous and craggy, full of rocks and stony places,
U||   so that the third part of this empire is not inhabited or
U||   manured.—Memorials of Japan (Hakluyt Society), p. 3.
U||   A rare and excellent wit untaught doth bring forth many good and evil
U||   things together; as a fat soil, that lieth unmanured, bringeth forth
U||   both herbs and weeds.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 185.
U||   Every man’s hand itching to throw a cudgel at him, who, like a
U||   nut-tree, must be manured by beating, or else would never bear
U||   fruit.—Fuller, Holy War, ii. 11.
U||   Mean,     }
U||   Meanness.
U||   O.E. ‘gemǽne,’ Goth. ‘gamains’ (compare Germ. ‘gemein’), cognate with
U||   Latin ‘communis’ (our ‘common’)—all with a history[Pg 172] very closely
U||   corresponding to that of the Greek κοινός (see Acts x. 14). The
U||   connotation of moral baseness only accrued to the word by degrees.
U||   And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself.—Isai.
U||   ii. 9. (A.V.)
U||   But, for his meannesse and disparagement,
U||   My Sire, who me too dearely well did love,
U||   Unto my choice by no meanes would assent.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, iv. 7, 16.
U||   Mechanic,   }
U||   Mechanical.
U||   A word which now simply expresses a fact, and is altogether untinged
U||   with passion or sentiment; but in its early history it ran exactly
U||   parallel to the Greek βάναυσος, which, expressing first one who plied a
U||   handicraft, came afterwards, in obedience to certain constant
U||   tendencies of language, to imply the man ethically illiberal. See the
U||   quotation from Holland, s. v. ‘Fairy.’
U||   Base and mechanical niggardise they [flatterers] account temperate
U||   frugality.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 93.
U||   Base dunghill villain and mechanical.
U||   Shakespeare, 2 Henry VI., act i. sc. 3.
U||   It was never a good world, since employment was counted mechanic, and
U||   idleness gentility.—Whitlock, Zootomia, p. 30.
U||   Meddle. This had once no such offensive meaning of mixing oneself up in
U||   other people’s business as now it has. On the contrary, Barrow in one
U||   of his sermons draws expressly the distinction between ‘meddling’ and
U||   being meddlesome, and only condemns the latter.
U||   In the drynke that she meddlid to you, mynge ye double to hir.—Apoc.
U||   xviii. 6. Wiclif.[Pg 173]
U||   How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a
U||   Samaritan? For the Jews meddle not [oὐ συγχρῶνται] with the
U||   Samaritans.—John iv. 9. Cranmer.
U||   We beseech you, brethren, that ye study to be quiet, and to meddle with
U||   your own business.—1 Thess. iv. 10, 11. Tyndale.
U||   Tho he, that had well y-cond his lere,
U||   Thus medled his talke with many a teare.
U||   Spenser, The Shepherd’s Calendar, May.
U||   Mediterranean. Only seas are ‘mediterranean’ now, and for us only one
U||   Sea; but there is no reason why cities and countries should not be
U||   characterized as ‘mediterranean’ as well; and they were so once. We
U||   have preferred, however, to employ ‘inland.’
U||   Their buildings are for the most part of tymber, for the mediterranean
U||   countreys have almost no stone.—The Kyngdome of Japonia, p. 6.
U||   An old man, full of days, and living still in your mediterranean city,
U||   Coventry.—Henry Holland, Preface to Holland’s Cyropædia.
U||   It [Arabia] hath store of cities, as well mediterranean as
U||   maritime.—Holland, Ammianus.
U||   Medley. The same word as the French ‘mêlée.’ It is plain from the
U||   frequent use of the French ‘mêlée’ in the description of battles that
U||   we feel now the want of a corresponding English word. There have been
U||   attempts, though hardly successful ones, to naturalize ‘mêlée,’ and as
U||   ‘volée’ has become in English ‘volley,’ that so ‘mêlée’ should become
U||   ‘melley.’ Perhaps, as Tennyson has sanctioned these, employing ‘mellay’
U||   in his Princess, they may now succeed. But there would have been no
U||   need of this, nor yet of borrowing the modern French form, if ‘medley’
U||   had been allowed[Pg 174] to keep this more passionate use, which once
U||   it possessed.
U||   The consul for his part forslowed not to come to handfight. The medley
U||   continued above three hours, and the hope of victory hung in equal
U||   balance.—Holland, Livy, p. 1119.
U||   Now began the conflict for the winning and defending of that old
U||   castle, which proved a medley of twelve hours long.—Swedish
U||   Intelligencer, vol. ii. p. 41.
U||   Melancholy. This has now ceased, nearly or altogether, to designate a
U||   particular form of moody madness, the German ‘Tiefsinn,’ which was
U||   ascribed by the old physicians to a predominance of black bile mingling
U||   with the blood. It was not, it is true, always restrained to this
U||   particular form of mental unsoundness; thus Burton’s ‘Anatomy of
U||   Melancholy’ has not to do with this one form of madness, but with all.
U||   This, however, was its prevailing use, and here is to be found the link
U||   of connexion between its present use, as a deep pensiveness or sadness,
U||   and its past.
U||   That property of melancholy, whereby men become to be delirious in some
U||   one point, their judgment standing untouched in others.—H. More, A
U||   Brief Discourse of Enthusiasm, sect. xiv.
U||   Luther’s conference with the devil might be, for ought I know, nothing
U||   but a melancholy dream.—Chillingworth, The Religion of Protestants,
U||   Preface.
U||   Though I am persuaded that none but the devil and this melancholy
U||   miscreant were in the plot [the Duke of Buckingham’s murder], yet in
U||   foro Dei many were guilty of this blood, that rejoiced it was
U||   spilt.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part ii. p. 80.
U||   [Pg 175]
U||   Some melancholy men have believed that elephants and birds and other
U||   creatures, have a language whereby they discourse with one
U||   another.—Bishop Reynolds, Passions and Faculties of the Soul, c. 39.
U||   Mere,   }
U||   Merely.
U||   There is a good note on these words, and on the changes of meaning
U||   which they have undergone, in Craik’s English of Shakespeare, p. 80. He
U||   there says: ‘Merely (from the Latin merus and mere) means purely, only.
U||   It separates that which it designates and qualifies from everything
U||   else. But in so doing the chief or most emphatic reference may be made
U||   either to that which is included, or to that which is excluded. In
U||   modern English it is always to the latter. In Shakespeare’s day the
U||   other reference was more common, that namely to what was included.’
U||   With them all the people of Mounster went out, and many other of them
U||   which were mere English, thenceforth joined themselves with the Irish
U||   against the king, and termed themselves very Irish.—Spenser, View of
U||   the State of Ireland.
U||   Our wine is here mingled with water and with myrrh; there [in heaven]
U||   it is mere and unmixed.—Bishop Taylor, The Worthy Communicant.
U||   The great winding-sheets, that bury all things in oblivion, are two,
U||   deluges and earthquakes. As for conflagrations and great droughts, they
U||   do not merely dispeople and destroy. Phaeton’s car went but a day; and
U||   the three years’ drought, in the time of Elias, was but particular, and
U||   left people alive.—Bacon, Essays, 58.
U||   Fye on’t; O fye! ’tis an unweeded garden,
U||   That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
U||   Possess it merely.
U||   Shakespeare, Hamlet, act i. sc. 2.
U||   [Pg 176]
U||   Mess. This used continually to be applied to a quarternion, or group of
U||   four persons or things. Probably in the distribution of food to large
U||   numbers, it was found most convenient to arrange them in fours, and
U||   hence this application of the word. A ‘mess’ at the Inns of Court still
U||   consists of four. A phrase-book published in London in 1617 bears this
U||   title, ‘Janua Linguarum Quadrilinguis, or A Messe of Tongues, Latine,
U||   English, French, and Spanish.’
U||   There lacks a fourth thing to make up the mess.—Latimer, Sermon 5.
U||   Where are your mess[292]19 of sons to back you now?
U||   Shakespeare, 3 Henry VI. act i. sc. 4.
U||   Amongst whom [converted Jews] we meet with a mess of most eminent men;
U||   Nicolaus Lyra, that grand commentator on the Bible; Hieronymus de
U||   Sanctâ Fide, turned Christian about anno 1412; Ludovicus Carettus,
U||   living in Paris anno 1553; and the never sufficiently to be praised
U||   Emmanuel Tremellius.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, part ii. b.
U||   5.
U||   Metal. The Latin ‘metallum’ signified a mine before it signified the
U||   metal which was found in the mine; and Jeremy Taylor uses ‘metal’ in
U||   this sense of mine. This may be a latinism peculiar to him, as he has
U||   of such not a few; in which case it would scarcely have a right to a
U||   place in this little volume, which does not propose to note the
U||   peculiarities of single writers, but the general course of the
U||   language. I, however, insert it, counting it more probable that my
U||   limited reading hinders me from furnishing an example of this use from
U||   some other author, than that such does not somewhere exist.
U||   [Pg 177]
U||   It was impossible to live without our king, but as slaves live, that
U||   is, such who are civilly dead, and persons condemned to metals.—Bishop
U||   Taylor, Ductor Dubitantium, Epistle Dedicatory.
U||   Methodist. This term is restricted at present to the followers of John
U||   Wesley; but it was once applied to those who followed a certain
U||   ‘method’ in philosophical speculation, or in the ethical treatment of
U||   themselves or others.
U||   The finest methodists, according to Aristotle’s golden rule of
U||   artificial bounds, condemn geometrical precepts in arithmetic, or
U||   arithmetical precepts in geometry, as irregular and abusive.—G. Harvey,
U||   Pierce’s Supererogation, p. 117.
U||   For physick, search into the writings of Hippocrates, Galen and the
U||   methodists.—Sanderson, Sermons, vol. ii. p. 135.
U||   All of us have some or other tender parts of our souls, which we cannot
U||   endure should be ungently touched; every man must be his own methodist
U||   to find them out.—Jackson, Justifying Faith, b. iv. c. 5.
U||   Militia. By this name, as the contests between Charles I. and his
U||   Parliament have made us all to know, the entire military force of the
U||   nation, and not a part of it only, was designated in the seventeenth
U||   century. It is true indeed that this force did much more nearly
U||   resemble our militia than our standing army, but it was never used for
U||   that to the exclusion of this.
U||   It was a small thing to contend with the Parliament about the sole
U||   power of the militia, which we see him doing little less than laying
U||   hands on the weapons of God Himself, which are his judgements, to wield
U||   and manage them by the sway and bent of his own frail
U||   cogitations.—Milton, Iconoclastes, c. 26.
U||   [Pg 178]
U||   The king’s captains and soldiers fight his battles, and yet he is
U||   summus imperator, and the power of the militia is his.—Bishop Taylor,
U||   Ductor Dubitantium, iii. 3, 7.
U||   Ye are of his flock and his militia; ye are now to fight his battles,
U||   and therefore to put on his armour.—Id., On Preparation for
U||   Confirmation, § 7.
U||   Minion. Once no more than darling or dearling (mignon). It is quite a
U||   superaddition of later times that the ‘minion’ is an unworthy object,
U||   on whom an excessive fondness is bestowed.
U||   Map now an Adam in thy memory,
U||   By God’s own hand made with great majesty;
U||   No idiot fool, nor drunk with vain opinion,
U||   But God’s disciple, and his dearest minion.
U||   Sylvester, Du Bartas’ Weeks, The Imposture.
U||   Whoso to marry a minion wife
U||   Hath had good chance and hap,
U||   Must love her and cherish her all his life,
U||   And dandle her in his lap.
U||   Old Song.
U||   Minute. ‘Minutes’ are now ‘minúte’ portions of time; they might once be
U||   ‘minúte’ portions of anything.
U||   But whanne a pore widewe was comun, sche keste two mynutis, that is a
U||   ferthing.—Mark xii. 42. Wiclif.
U||   Let us, with the poor widow of the Gospel, at least give two
U||   minutes.—Becon, The Nosegay, Preface.
U||   An enquiry into the minutes of conscience is commonly the work of
U||   persons that live holily.—Bishop Taylor, Doctrine and Practice of
U||   Repentance, Preface.
U||   And now, after such a sublimity of malice, I will not instance in the
U||   sacrilegious ruin of the neighbouring temples, which needs must have
U||   perished in the flame. These are but minutes, in respect of the ruin
U||   prepared for the living temples.—Id., Sermon on the Gunpowder Treason.
U||   [Pg 179]
U||   Miscreant. A settled conviction that to believe wrongly is the way to
U||   live wrongly has caused that in all languages words, which originally
U||   did but indicate the first, have gradually acquired a meaning of the
U||   second. There is no more illustrious example of this than ‘miscreant,’
U||   which now charges him to whom it is applied not with religious error,
U||   but with extreme moral depravity; while yet, according to its
U||   etymology, it did but mean at the first misbeliever, and as such would
U||   have been as freely applied to the morally most blameless of these as
U||   to the vilest and the worst. In the quotation from Shakespeare York
U||   means to charge the Maid of Orleans, as a dealer in unlawful charms,
U||   with apostasy from the Christian faith, according to the low and
U||   unworthy estimate of her character, above which even Shakespeare
U||   himself has not risen.
U||   We are not therefore ashamed of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,
U||   because miscreants in scorn have upbraided us that the highest of our
U||   wisdom is, Believe.—Hooker, Ecclesiastical Polity, b. v.
U||   One sort you say be those that believe not in Christ, but deny Christ
U||   and his Scripture; as be the Turks, paynims, and such other
U||   miscreants.—Frith, Works, 1572, p. 62.
U||   Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake.
U||   Shakespeare, 1 Henry VI., act v. sc. 2.
U||   The consort and the principal servants of Soliman had been honourably
U||   restored without ransom; and the emperor’s generosity to the miscreant
U||   was interpreted as treason to the Christian cause.—Gibbon, Decline and
U||   Fall of the Roman Empire, c. 58.
U||   Miser, [Pg 180] }
U||   Misery,
U||   Miserable.
U||   We may notice a curious shifting of parts in ‘miser,’ ‘misery,’
U||   ‘miserable.’ There was a time when the ‘miser’ was the wretched man, he
U||   is now the covetous; at the same time ‘misery,’ which is now
U||   wretchedness, and ‘miserable,’ which is now wretched, were severally
U||   covetousness and covetous. They have in fact exactly reversed their
U||   uses. Men still express by some words of this group, although not by
U||   the same, by ‘miser’ (and ‘miserly’), not as once by ‘misery’ and
U||   ‘miserable,’ their deep moral conviction that the avaricious man is his
U||   own tormentor, and bears his punishment involved in his sin. A passage,
U||   too long to quote, in Gascoigne’s Fruits of War, st. 72-74, is very
U||   instructive on the different uses of the word ‘miser’ even in his time,
U||   and on the manner in which it was even then hovering between the two
U||   meanings.
U||   Because thou sayest, ‘That I am rich and enriched and lack nothing;’
U||   and knowest not that thou art a miser [et nescis quia tu es miser,
U||   Vulg.] and miserable and poor and blind and naked.—Rev. iii. 17.
U||   Rhemish Version.
U||   Vouchsafe to stay your steed for humble miser’s sake.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, ii. 1, 8.
U||   He [Perseus] returned again to his old humour which was born and bred
U||   with him, and that was avarice and misery.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p.
U||   215.
U||   But Brutus, scorning his [Octavius Cæsar’s] misery and niggardliness,
U||   gave unto every band a number of wethers to sacrifice, and fifty silver
U||   drachmas to every soldier.—Id., ib., p. 830.
U||   If avarice be thy vice, yet make it not thy punishment; miserable men
U||   commiserate not themselves; bowelless unto themselves, and merciless
U||   unto their own bowels.—Sir T. Browne, Letter to a Friend.
U||   [Pg 181]
U||   The liberal-hearted man is by the opinion of the prodigal, miserable;
U||   and by the judgment of the miserable, lavish.—Hooker, Ecclesiastical
U||   Polity, b. v. c. 65.
U||   Miss. Now to be conscious of the loss of, and nearly answering to the
U||   Latin ‘desiderare,’ but once to do without, to dispense with.
U||   But as ’tis,
U||   We cannot miss him; he does make our fire,
U||   Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices
U||   That profit us.
U||   Shakespeare, Tempest, act i. sc. 2.
U||   I will have honest valiant souls about me,
U||   I cannot miss thee.
U||   Beaumont and Fletcher, The Mad Lover, act. ii.
U||   Model. This is due to a French form from a late Latin diminutive of
U||   ‘modulus,’ a diminutive of ‘modus;’ but this diminutive sense which
U||   once went constantly with the word, and which will alone explain the
U||   quotations which follow, when it lies in the word now, exists only by
U||   accident of context.
U||   O England, model to thy inward greatness,
U||   Like little body with a mighty heart.
U||   Shakespeare, Henry V., act ii. Chorus.
U||   And nothing can we call our own but death,
U||   And that small model of the barren earth
U||   Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
U||   Id., Richard II., act iii. sc. 2.
U||   If Solomon’s Temple were compared to some structures and fanes of
U||   heathen gods, it would appear as St. Gregory’s to St. Paul’s (the babe
U||   by the mother’s side), or rather this David’s model would be like David
U||   himself standing by Goliath, so gigantic were some pagan fabrics in
U||   comparison thereof.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. iii. c. 3.
U||   [Pg 182]
U||   Mood. It is hardly necessary to observe that there are two ‘moods’ in
U||   the English language, the one the Latin ‘modus,’ and existing in the
U||   two forms of ‘mood’ (grammatical) and ‘mode;’ the other the Anglo-Saxon
U||   ‘mód,’ the German ‘muth.’ It is this last with which we are dealing
U||   here. It would seem as if its homonym had influenced it so far as to
U||   take out in great part the force from it, though not from ‘moody;’ but
U||   it had not always so done.
U||   And on here bare knees adoun they falle,
U||   And wolde han kist his feet ther as he stood,
U||   Till atte laste aslaked was his mood.
U||   Chaucer, The Knightes Tale, 900.
U||   And as a lion skulking all in night
U||   Far off in pastures, and, come home, all dight
U||   In jaws and breastlocks with an oxe’s blood
U||   New feasted on him, his looks full of mood,
U||   So looked Ulysses.
U||   Chapman, Homer’s Odysseis, xxii. 518.
U||   Then Phœbus gathered up his steeds that yet for fear had run
U||   Like flaighted fiends, and in his mood without respect begun
U||   To beat his whipstock on their pates, and lash them on their sides.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. ii.
U||   Morose. It is very curious that while the classical ‘mōrosus’ expressed
U||   one given overmuch to his own manners, habits, ways (mores), very
U||   nearly the Greek αὐθέκαστος, the medieval ‘mŏrosus’ was commonly
U||   connected with ‘mora,’ a delay;[293]20 and in treatises of Christian
U||   ethics was the technical word to express the sin of delaying upon
U||   impure, wanton,[Pg 183] or, as in the quotation from South, malignant
U||   thoughts, instead of rejecting them on the instant. See, for instance,
U||   Gerson, Opp., vol. i. p. 377, for evidence constantly recurring of its
U||   connexion for him with ‘mora.’ So long as the scholastic theology
U||   exerted more or less influence on our own, ‘morose’ was often employed
U||   in this sense; which, however, it has since entirely foregone. I owe
U||   the third quotation given below to Todd, who is so entirely unaware of
U||   this history of ‘morose,’ that he explains it there as ungovernable!
U||   Here are forbidden all wanton words, and all morose delighting in
U||   venereous thoughts, all rolling and tossing such things in our
U||   minds.—Bishop Taylor, Doctrine and Practice of Repentance, c. 4, § 1.
U||   All morose thoughts, that is, delaying, dwelling, or insisting on such
U||   thoughts, fancying of such unclean matters with delectation.—Hammond,
U||   Practical Catechism, b. ii. § 6.
U||   In this [the seventh] commandment are forbidden all that feed this sin
U||   [adultery], or are incentives to it, as luxurious diet, inflaming
U||   wines, an idle life, morose thoughts, that dwell in the fancy with
U||   delight.—Nicholson, Exposition of the Catechism, 1662, p. 123.
U||   For we must know that it is the morose dwelling of the thoughts upon an
U||   injury, a long and sullen meditation upon a wrong, that incorporates
U||   and rivets it into the mind.—South, Sermons, vol. x. p. 278.
U||   Mortal. We speak still of a ‘mortal’ sin or a ‘mortal’ wound, but the
U||   active sense has nearly departed from the word, as the passive has
U||   altogether departed from ‘deadly,’ which see.
U||   Were there a serpent seen with forkéd tongue
U||   That slily glided towards your majesty,
U||   [Pg 184]
U||   It were but necessary you were waked,
U||   Lest, being suffered in that harmful slumber,
U||   The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal.
U||   Shakespeare, 2 Henry VI., act iii. sc. 2.
U||   Come, thou mortal wretch,
U||   With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
U||   Of life at once untie.
U||   Id., Antony and Cleopatra, act v. sc. 2.
U||   Mountebank. Now any antic fool; but once restrained to the quack-doctor
U||   who at fairs and such places of resort, having mounted on a bank or
U||   bench, from thence proclaimed the virtue of his drugs; being described
U||   by Whitlock (Zootomia, p. 436) as ‘a fellow above the vulgar more by
U||   three planks and two empty hogsheads than by any true skill.’ See the
U||   quotation from Jackson, s. v. ‘Authentic.’
U||   Such is the weakness and easy credulity of men, that a mountebank or
U||   cunning woman is preferred before an able physician.—Whitlock,
U||   Zootomia, p. 437.
U||   Giving no cause of complaint to any but such as are unwilling to be
U||   healed of their shameful and dangerous diseases, who love ignorant and
U||   flattering mountebanks more than the most learned and faithful
U||   physicians of souls.—Gauden, Hieraspistes, p. 427.
U||   Above the reach of antidotes, the power
U||   Of the famed Pontic mountebank to cure.
U||   Oldham, Third Satire upon the Jesuits.
U||   Muse. There is a very curious use of ‘Muse’ in our earlier literature,
U||   according to which the female sex of this inspirer of song falls quite
U||   out of sight. This recurs too often and too deliberately to be
U||   explained away as the accidental inaccuracy of some single writer.
U||   [Pg 185]
U||   Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds
U||   Intends our Muse to vaunt his heavenly verse.
U||   Marlowe, Dr. Faustus, 5, 6.
U||   So is it not with me as with that Muse,
U||   Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse.
U||   Shakespeare, Sonnet 21.
U||   So may some gentle Muse,
U||   With lucky words favour my destined urn,
U||   And, as he passes, turn.
U||   Milton, Lycidas, 19.
U||   Sharp-judging Adriel, the Muses’ friend,
U||   Himself a Muse.
U||   Dryden, Absalom and Achitophel, pt. 1.
U||   Mutton. It is a refinement in the English language, one wanting in some
U||   other languages which count themselves as refined or more, that it has
U||   in so many cases one word to express the living animal, and another its
U||   flesh prepared for food; ox and beef, calf and veal, deer and venison,
U||   sheep and mutton. In this last instance the refinement is of somewhat
U||   late introduction. At one time they were synonyms.
U||   Peucestas, having feasted them in the kingdom of Persia, and given
U||   every soldier a mutton to sacrifice, thought he had won great favour
U||   and credit among them.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 505.
U||   A starved mutton’s carcass would better fit their palates.—Ben Jonson,
U||   The Sad Shepherd, act i. sc. 2.
U||   Namely. Now only designates; but, like the German ‘namentlich,’ once
U||   designated as first and chief, as deserving above all others to be
U||   named.
U||   For there are many disobedient, and talkers of vanity, and deceivers of
U||   minds, namely [μάλιστα] they of the circumcision.—Tit. i. 10.
U||   Tyndale.[Pg 186]
U||   For in the darkness occasioned by the opposition of the earth just in
U||   the mids between the sun and the moon, there was nothing for him
U||   [Nicias] to fear, and namely at such a time, when there was cause for
U||   him to have stood upon his feet, and served valiantly in the
U||   field.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 265.
U||   Naturalist. At present the student of natural history; but in the
U||   sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the name was often given to the
U||   deist, as one who denied any but a religion of nature, ‘Natural
U||   religion men’ such were sometimes called. See the quotation from
U||   Rogers, s. v. ‘Civil.’
U||   But that he [the atheist] might not be shy of me, I have conformed
U||   myself as near his own garb as I might, without partaking of his folly
U||   or wickedness; and have appeared in the plain shape of a mere
U||   naturalist myself, that I might, if it were possible, win him off from
U||   downright atheism.—H. More, Antidote against Atheism, Preface, p. 7.
U||   This is the invention of Satan, that whereas all will not be profane,
U||   nor naturalists, nor epicures, but will be religious, lo, he hath a
U||   bait for every fish, and can insinuate himself as well into religion
U||   itself as into lusts and pleasures.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 115.
U||   Heathen naturalists hold better consort with the primitive Church
U||   concerning the nature of sin original than the Socinians.—Jackson, Of
U||   Christ’s Everlasting Priesthood, b. x. c. 8, § 4.
U||   Needful. This was once often equivalent to ‘needy.’ The words, however,
U||   have in more recent times been discriminated in use, and ‘needy’ is
U||   active, and ‘needful’ passive.
U||   These ferthinges shal be gaderid at everi moneth ende, and delid forth
U||   to the needful man in honor of Christ and his moder.—English Gilds, p.
U||   38.
U||   [Pg 187]
U||   Grieve not the heart of him that is helpless, and withdraw not the gift
U||   from the needful.—Ecclus. iv. 2. Coverdale.
U||   For thou art the poor man’s help, and strength for the needful in his
U||   necessity.—Isai. xxv. 3. Id.
U||   Great variety of clothes have been permitted to princes and nobility,
U||   and they usually give those clothes as rewards to servants and other
U||   persons needful enough.—Bishop Taylor, Holy Living, iv. 8, 13.
U||   Nephew. Restrained at this present to the son of a brother or a sister;
U||   but formerly of much laxer use, a grandson, or even a remoter lineal
U||   descendant. In East Anglia it is still so used in the popular language
U||   (see Nall, Dialects of the East Coast, s. v.). ‘Nephew’ in fact has
U||   undergone exactly the same change of meaning that ‘nepos’ in Latin
U||   underwent; which in the Augustan age meaning grandson, in the
U||   post-Augustan acquired the signification of ‘nephew’ in our present
U||   acceptation of that word. See ‘Niece.’
U||   The warts, black moles, spots and freckles of fathers, not appearing at
U||   all upon their own children’s skin, begin afterwards to put forth and
U||   show themselves in their nephews, to wit, the children of their sons
U||   and daughters.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 555.
U||   With what intent they [the apocryphal books] were first published,
U||   those words of the nephew of Jesus do plainly enough signify: After
U||   that my grandfather Jesus had given himself to the reading of the law
U||   and the prophets, he purposed also to write something pertaining to
U||   learning and wisdom.—Hooker, Ecclesiastical Polity, b. v. c. 20.
U||   If any widow have children or nephews [ἔκγονα], let them learn first to
U||   show piety at home, and to requite their parents.—1 Tim. v. 4. (A.V.)
U||   Nice. The use of ‘nice’ in the sense of fastidious, difficult to
U||   please, still survives, indeed this is now,[Pg 188] as in times past,
U||   the ruling notion of the word; only this ‘niceness’ is taken now much
U||   oftener in good part than in ill; nor, even when taken in an ill sense,
U||   would the word be used exactly as in the passage which follows.
U||   A. W. [Anthony Wood] was with him several times, ate and drank with
U||   him, and had several discourses with him concerning arms and armory,
U||   which he understood well; but he found him nice and supercilious.—A.
U||   Wood, Athenæ Oxonienses, 1848, vol. i. p. 161.
U||   Niece. This word has undergone the same change and limitation of
U||   meaning as ‘nephew,’ with indeed the further limitation that it is now
U||   applied to the female sex alone, to the daughter of a brother or a
U||   sister, being once used, as ‘neptis’ was at the first, for children’s
U||   children, male and female alike. See ‘Nephew.’
U||   Laban answeride to hym: My dowytres and sones, and the flockis, and
U||   alle that thou beholdist, ben myne, and what may I do to my sones and
U||   to my neces?—Gen. xxi. 43 (cf. Exod. xxxiv. 7). Wiclif.
U||   The Emperor Augustus, among other singularities that he had by himself
U||   during his life, saw, ere he died, the nephew of his niece, that is to
U||   say, his progeny to the fourth degree of lineal descent.—Holland,
U||   Pliny, vol. i. p. 162.
U||   Within the compass of which very same time he [Julius Cæsar] lost by
U||   death first his mother, then his daughter Julia, and not long after his
U||   niece by the said daughter.—Id., Suetonius, p. 11.
U||   Noisome,     }
U||   Noisomeness.
U||   At present offensive and moving disgust; but once noxious and actually
U||   hurtful; thus a skunk would be ‘noisome’ now; a tiger was ‘noisome’
U||   then. In all passages of[Pg 189] the Authorized Translation of the
U||   Bible where the word occurs, as at Ezek. xiv. 15, 21, it is used not in
U||   the present meaning, but the past. See ‘Annoy.’
U||   They that will be rich fall into temptations and snares, and into many
U||   foolish and noisome [βλαβεράς] lusts, which drown men in perdition and
U||   destruction.—1 Tim. vi. 9. Geneva.
U||   He [the superstitious person] is persuaded that they be gods indeed,
U||   but such as be noisome, hurtful, and doing mischief unto men.—Holland,
U||   Plutarch’s Morals, p. 260.
U||   This noisome creature [the crocodile] is one of the greatest wonders we
U||   meet with, in that from so small a beginning as an egg, not much bigger
U||   than that of a turkey, they increase to eight or ten yards in
U||   length.—Herbert, Travels, 1636, p. 323.
U||   They [the prelates] are so far from hindering dissension, that they
U||   have made unprofitable, and even noisome, the chiefest remedy we have
U||   to keep Christendom at one, which is, by Councils.—Milton, Reason of
U||   Church Government, b. i. c. 6.
U||   Sad in his time was the condition of the Israelites, oppressed by the
U||   Midianites, who swarmed like grasshoppers for number and noisomeness,
U||   devouring all which the other had sown.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of
U||   Palestine, part i. b. ii. c. 8.
U||   Novel,    }
U||   Novelist.
U||   ‘Novels’ once were simply news, ‘nouvelles;’ and the ‘novelist’ not a
U||   writer of new tales, but an innovator, a bringer in of new fashions
U||   into the Church or State.
U||   She brynges in her bille som novels new;
U||   Behold! it is of an olif tree
U||   A branch, thynkes me.
U||   Townley Mysteries.
U||   But, see and say what you will, novelists had rather be talked of, that
U||   they began a fashion and set a copy for[Pg 190] others, than to keep
U||   within the imitation of the most excellent precedents.—Hacket, Life of
U||   Archbishop Williams, part ii. p. 36.
U||   Every novelist with a whirligig in his brain must broach new opinions,
U||   and those made canons, nay sanctions, as sure as if a General Council
U||   had confirmed them.—Adams, The Devil’s Banquet, 1614, p. 52.
U||   I can hardly believe my eyes while I read such a petit novelist
U||   charging the whole Church as fools and heretics for not subscribing to
U||   a silly heretical notion, solely of his own invention.—South,
U||   Animadversions on Dr. Sherlock’s Book, p. 3.
U||   Nursery. We have but one use of ‘nursery’ at this present, namely as
U||   the place of nursing; but it was once applied as well to the person
U||   nursed, or the act of nursing.
U||   A jolly dame, no doubt; as appears by the well battling of the plump
U||   boy, her nursery.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, part i. b. ii.
U||   c. 8.
U||   If nursery exceeds her [a mother’s] strength, and yet her conscience
U||   will scarce permit her to lay aside and free herself from so natural,
U||   so religious a work, yet tell her, God loves mercy better than
U||   sacrifice.—Rogers, Matrimonial Honour, p. 247.
U||   I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
U||   On her kind nursery.
U||   Shakespeare, King Lear, act i. sc. 1.
U||   Obelisk. The ‘obelus’ is properly a sharp-pointed spear or spit. With a
U||   sign resembling this, spurious or doubtful passages were marked in the
U||   books of antiquity, which sign bore therefore this name of ‘obelus,’ or
U||   sometimes of its diminutive ‘obeliscus.’ It is in this sense that we
U||   find ‘obelisk’ employed by the writers in the seventeenth century;
U||   while for[Pg 191] us at the present a small pillar tapering towards the
U||   summit is the only ‘obelisk’ that we know.
U||   The Lord Keeper, the most circumspect of any man alive to provide for
U||   uniformity, and to countenance it, was scratched with their obelisk,
U||   that he favoured Puritans, and that sundry of them had protection
U||   through his connivency or clemency.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop
U||   Williams, part i. p. 95.
U||   I have set my mark upon them [i.e. affected pedantic words]; and if any
U||   of them may have chanced to escape the obelisk, there can arise no
U||   other inconvenience from it but an occasion to exercise the choice and
U||   judgment of the reader.—Phillips, New World of Words, Preface.
U||   Obnoxious. This, in its present lax and slovenly use a vague
U||   unserviceable synonym for offensive, is properly applied to one who on
U||   the ground of a mischief or wrong committed by him is justly liable to
U||   punishment (ob noxam pœnæ obligatus); and is used in this sense by
U||   South (see below). But there often falls out of the word the sense of a
U||   wrong committed; and that of liability to punishment, whether just or
U||   unjust, only remains; it does so very markedly in the quotation from
U||   Donne. But we punish, or wish to punish, those whom we dislike, and
U||   thus ‘obnoxious’ has obtained its present sense of offensive.
U||   They envy Christ, but they turn upon the man, who was more obnoxious to
U||   them, and they tell him that it was not lawful for him to carry his bed
U||   that day [John v. 10].—Donne, Sermon 20.
U||   Examine thyself in the particulars of thy relations; especially where
U||   thou governest and takest accounts of others, and art not so obnoxious
U||   to them as they to thee.—Bishop Taylor, The Worthy Communicant, c. vi.
U||   sect. 2.
U||   [Pg 192]
U||   What shall we then say of the power of God Himself to dispose of men?
U||   little, finite, obnoxious things of his own making?—South, Sermons,
U||   1744, vol. viii. p. 315.
U||   He [Satan] is in a chain, and that chain is in God’s hand; and
U||   consequently, notwithstanding his utmost spite, he cannot be more
U||   malicious than he is obnoxious.—Id., ib. vol. vi. p. 287.
U||   Obsequious,     }
U||   Obsequiousness.
U||   There lies ever in ‘obsequious’ at the present the sense of an
U||   observance which is overdone, of an unmanly readiness to fall in with
U||   the will of another; there lay nothing of this in the Latin
U||   ‘obsequium,’ nor yet in our English word as employed two centuries ago.
U||   See the quotation from Feltham, s. v. ‘Garb.’
U||   Besides many other fishes in divers places, which are very obeisant and
U||   obsequious, when they be called by their names.—Holland, Plutarch’s
U||   Morals, p. 970.
U||   I ever set this down, that the only course to be held with the Queen
U||   was by obsequiousness and observance.—Lord Bacon, Defence of Himself.
U||   His corrections are so far from compelling men to come to heaven, as
U||   that they put many men farther out of their way, and work an obduration
U||   rather than an obsequiousness.—Donne, Sermon 45.
U||   In her relation to the king she was the best pattern of conjugal love
U||   and obsequiousness.—Bates, Sermon upon the Death of the Queen.
U||   Occupy,  }
U||   Occupier.
U||   He now ‘occupies’ who has in present possession; but the word involved
U||   once the further signification of using, employing, laying out that
U||   which was thus possessed; and by an ‘occupier’ was meant a trader or
U||   retail dealer.
U||   [Pg 193]
U||   He [Eumenes] made as though he had occasion to occupy money, and so
U||   borrowed a great sum of them.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 505.
U||   If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then
U||   shall I be weak, and be as another man.—Judges xvi. 11. (A.V.)
U||   Mercury, the master of merchants and occupiers [ἀγοραίων].—Holland,
U||   Plutarch’s Morals, p. 692.
U||   Offal. This, bearing its derivation on its front, namely that it is
U||   that which, as refuse and of little or no worth, is suffered or caused
U||   to fall off, we restrict at the present to the refuse of the butcher’s
U||   stall; but it was once employed in a much wider acceptation, an
U||   acceptation which here and there still survives. Thus, as one who
U||   writes to me, ‘in all her Majesty’s dockyards there is a monthly sale
U||   by auction of “offal wood,” being literally that which falls off from
U||   the log under the saw, axe, or adze.’
U||   Glean not in barren soil these offal ears,
U||   Sith reap thou may’st whole harvests of delight.
U||   Southwell, Lewd Love is Loss.
U||   Of gold the very smallest filings are precious, and our Blessed
U||   Saviour, when there was no want of provision, yet gave it in charge to
U||   his disciples, the off-fall should not be lost.—Sanderson, Preface to
U||   the Clavi Trabales.
U||   Poor Lazarus lies howling at his gates for a few crumbs; he only seeks
U||   chippings, offals; let him roar and howl, famish and eat his own flesh;
U||   he respects him not.—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy, part iii. sect. 1.
U||   Officious,    }
U||   Officiousness.
U||   Again and again we light on words used once in a good, but now in an
U||   unfavourable, sense. An ‘officious’ person is now a busy uninvited
U||   meddler in matters which[Pg 194] do not belong to him; so late as
U||   Burke’s time he might be one prompt and forward in due offices of
U||   kindness. The more honourable use of ‘officious’ now only survives in
U||   the distinction familiar to diplomacy between an ‘official’ and
U||   ‘officious’ communication.
U||   With granted leave officious I return.
U||   Milton, Paradise Regained, ii. 302.
U||   Officious, ready to do good offices, serviceable, friendly, very
U||   courteous and obliging.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   They [the nobility of France] were tolerably well bred, very officious,
U||   humane, and hospitable.—Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France,
U||   p. 251.
U||   Well try’d through many a varying year,
U||   See Levett to the grave descend,
U||   Officious, innocent, sincere,
U||   Of every friendless name the friend.
U||   S. Johnson (A.D. 1782).
U||   Which familiar and affectionate officiousness and sumptuous cost,
U||   together with that sinister fame that woman was noted with [Luke vii.
U||   37], could not but give much scandal to the Pharisees there present.—H.
U||   More, Grand Mystery of Godliness, b. viii. c. 13.
U||   Orient. This had once a beautiful use, as clear, bright, shining, which
U||   has now wholly departed from it. Thus, the ‘orient’ pearl of our
U||   earlier poets is not ‘oriental,’ but pellucid, white, shining.
U||   Doubtless it acquired this meaning originally from the greater
U||   clearness and lightness of the east, as the quarter whence the day
U||   breaks.
U||   Those shells that keep in the main sea, and lie deeper than that the
U||   sunbeams can pierce unto them, keep the finest and most delicate
U||   pearls. And yet they as orient as[Pg 195] they be, wax yellow with
U||   age.—Holland, Pliny, vol. i. p. 255.
U||   He, who out of that dark chaos made the glorious heavens, and garnished
U||   them with so many orient stars, can move upon thy dark soul and
U||   enlighten it, though now it be as void of knowledge as the evening of
U||   the first day was of light.—Gurnall, Christian in Complete Armour, ii.
U||   22, 1.
U||   Her wings and train of feathers, mixed fine
U||   Of orient azure and incarnadine.
U||   Sylvester, Du Bartas, Fifth Day.
U||   Κόκκος βαφική, a shrub, whose red berries or grains gave an orient
U||   tincture to cloth.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. iv. c. 6.
U||   Ortolan. This, the name now of a delicate bird haunting gardens, was
U||   once the name of the gardener (‘hortolanus,’ ‘ortolano’) himself.
U||   Though to an old tree it must needs be somewhat dangerous to be oft
U||   removed, yet for my part I yield myself entirely to the will and
U||   pleasure of the most notable ortolan.—State Papers, 1536, vol. vi. p.
U||   534.
U||   Ostler. Not formerly the servant of the inn having care of the horses,
U||   but the innkeeper or host, the ‘hosteller’ himself.
U||   And another dai he brougte forth twey pans, and gaf to the ostiler
U||   [stabulario, Vulg].—Luke x. 35. Wiclif.
U||   The innkeeper was old, fourscore almost;
U||   Indeed an emblem, rather than an host;
U||   In whom we read how God and Time decree
U||   To honour thrifty ostlers, such as he.
U||   Corbet. Iter. Boreale.
U||   Ought. Of the two perfects of the verb ‘to owe’ (see Morris, English
U||   Accidence, p. 189; and Earle, Philology of the English Tongue, § 289),
U||   namely[Pg 196] ‘ought’ and ‘owed,’ the former has come now to be used
U||   of a moral owing or obligation only, never of a material; but it was
U||   not always so. In the passage from Spenser ‘ought’ is used in the sense
U||   of ‘possessed.’ Among the many tacit alterations which our Authorized
U||   Version has at various times undergone, the substitution in many places
U||   of ‘owed’ for ‘ought’ is one.
U||   But th’ Elfin knight which ought that warlike wage,
U||   Disdaind to loose the meed he wonne in fray.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, i. 4, 39.
U||   There was a certain creditor, who had two debtors. The one ought five
U||   hundred pence, and the other fifty.—Luke vii. 41. (A. V.)
U||   Also we forgive the oversights and faults committed against us, and the
U||   crown-tax that ye ought us.—1 Macc. xiii. 39. Geneva Version.
U||   Overture. Not now an aperture or opening, in the literal and primary
U||   sense of the word, as formerly it was; but always in some secondary and
U||   derived.
U||   The squirrels also foresee a tempest coming; and look in what corner
U||   the wind is like to stand, on that side they stop up the mouth of their
U||   holes, and make an overture on the other side against it.—Holland,
U||   Pliny, b. viii. c. 38.
U||   Painful,     }
U||   Painfulness,
U||   Painfully.
U||   ‘Painful’ is now feeling pain, or inflicting it; it was once taking
U||   pains. Many things would not be so ‘painful’ in the present sense of
U||   the word, if they had been more ‘painful’ in the earlier,—as perhaps
U||   some sermons.
U||   Within fourteen generations, the royal blood of the kings of Judah ran
U||   in the veins of plain Joseph, a painful carpenter.—Fuller, Holy War, b.
U||   v. c. 29.
U||   [Pg 197]
U||   I think we have some as painful magistrates as ever was in
U||   England.—Latimer, Sermons, p. 142.
U||   Painfulness by feeble means shall be able to gain that which in the
U||   plenty of more forcible instruments is through sloth and negligence
U||   lost.—Hooker, Ecclesiastical Polity, b. v. § 22.
U||   O the holiness of their living, and painfulness of their
U||   preaching!—Fuller, Holy State, b. ii. c. 6.
U||   Whoever would be truly thankful, let him live in some honest vocation,
U||   and therein bestow himself faithfully and painfully.—Sanderson,
U||   Sermons, vol. i. p. 251.
U||   Palestine. This is now a name for the entire Holy Land; but in the
U||   Authorized Version ‘Palestine,’ or ‘Palestina,’ as it is written three
U||   times out of the four on which it occurs, is used in a far more
U||   restricted sense, namely, as equivalent to Philistia, that narrow strip
U||   of coast occupied by the Philistines. This a close examination of the
U||   several passages (see Wright’s Dictionary of the Bible) will make
U||   abundantly clear. And it is also invariably so employed by Milton; thus
U||   see, besides the passage quoted below, Samson Agonistes, 144, and On
U||   the Nativity, 199.
U||   Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote
U||   thee is broken.—Isai. xiv. 29. (A.V.)
U||   Such their [the Philistines’] puissance, that from them the Greeks and
U||   Latins called all this land Palestina, because the Philistines lived on
U||   the sea coast, most obvious to the notice of foreigners.—Fuller, A
U||   Pisgah Sight of Palestine, ii. 10, 23.
U||   Dagon his name, sea-monster, upward man
U||   And downward fish: yet had his temple high
U||   [Pg 198]
U||   Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast
U||   Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,
U||   And Accaron, and Gaza’s frontier bounds.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, i. 462.
U||   Palliate,   }
U||   Palliation.
U||   ‘To palliate’ is at this day to extenuate a fault through the setting
U||   out of whatever will best serve to diminish the estimate of its
U||   gravity; and does not imply any endeavour wholly to deny it; nay,
U||   implies rather a certain recognition and admission of the fault itself.
U||   Truer to its etymology once, it expressed the cloking of it, the
U||   attempt, successful or otherwise, entirely to conceal and cover it. Eve
U||   ‘palliates’ her fault in the modern sense of the word (Gen. iii. 13),
U||   Gehazi in the earlier (2 Kin. v. 25).
U||   You cannot palliate mischief, but it will
U||   Through all the fairest coverings of deceit
U||   Be always seen.
U||   Daniel, The Tragedy of Philotas, act iv. sc. 2.
U||   You see the Devil could fetch up nothing of Samuel at the request of
U||   Saul, but a shadow and a resemblance, his countenance and his mantle,
U||   which yet was not enough to cover the cheat, or to palliate the
U||   illusion.—South, Sermon on Easter Day.
U||   The generality of Christians make the external frame of religion but a
U||   palliation for sin.—H. More, Grand Mystery of Godliness, p. ix.
U||   Pantomime.—Now the mimic show itself, but at the first introduction of
U||   the word (Bacon’s constant use of ‘pantomimus’ and ‘pantomimi,’ and Ben
U||   Jonson’s as well, testify that it was new in their time), the player
U||   who presented the show.
U||   [Pg 199]
U||   I would our pantomimes also and stage-players would examine themselves
U||   and their callings by this rule.—Sanderson, Sermon on 1 Cor. vii. 24.
U||   The hypocrite cometh forth in a disguise, and acteth his part, and
U||   because men applaud him, thinketh God is of their mind, as the
U||   pantomime in Seneca, who observing the people well pleased with his
U||   dancing, did every day go up into the Capitol and dance before Jupiter,
U||   and was persuaded that he was also delighted in him.—Faringdon, Sermon
U||   10.
U||   Not that I think those pantomimes,
U||   Who vary actions with the times,
U||   Are less ingenious in their art
U||   Than those who dully act one part.
U||   Butler, Hudibras, p. 3, can. 2.
U||   Pathetic,     }
U||   Pathetical,
U||   Pathetically.
U||   The ‘pathetic’ is now only one kind of the passionate, that which,
U||   feeling pity, is itself capable of stirring it; but ‘pathetic’ or
U||   ‘pathetical’ and ‘passionate’ were once of an equal reach. When in a
U||   language like ours two words, derived from two different languages, as
U||   in this case from the Greek and from the Latin, exist side by side,
U||   being at the same time identical in signification, the desynonymizing
U||   process which we may note here, continually comes into play.
U||   He [Hiel, cf. Josh. vi. 26 and 1 Kings xvi. 34] mistood Joshua’s curse
U||   rather for a pathetical expression than prophetical prediction.—Fuller,
U||   A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. ii. c. 12.
U||   Whatever word enhanceth Joseph’s praise,
U||   Her echo doubles it, and doth supply
U||   Some more pathetic and transcendant phrase
U||   To raise his merit.
U||   Beaumont, Psyche, c. i. st. 148.
U||   For Truth, I know not how, hath this unhappiness fatal to her, ere she
U||   can come to the trial and inspection of the[Pg 200] understanding;
U||   being to pass through many little wards and limits of the several
U||   affections and desires, she cannot shift it, but must put on such
U||   colours and attire as those pathetical handmaids of the soul please to
U||   lead her in to their queen.—Milton, Reason of Church Government, b. ii.
U||   c. 3.
U||   But the principal point whereon our apostle pitcheth for evincing the
U||   priesthood of Christ to be far more excellent than the Levitical
U||   priesthood was, was reserved to the last, and pathetically though
U||   briefly avouched, ver. 20 [Heb. vii. 20].—Jackson, Of the Divine
U||   Essence and Attributes, b. ix. § 2.
U||   Pattern. One is at first tempted to accuse our Translators of an
U||   inaccuracy at Heb. ix. 23, since, whatever ὑπόδειγμα may mean
U||   elsewhere, it is impossible that it can there mean ‘pattern,’ in our
U||   sense of exemplar or original from which a copy or sketch is derived,
U||   ‘patron’ upon whom the client forms and fashions himself. This is
U||   inconsistent with, and would indeed entirely defeat, the whole argument
U||   of the Apostle. The ὑποδείγματα there can be only the earthly copies
U||   and imitations of the heavenly and archetypal originals, ἀντίτυπα τῶν
U||   ἀληθινῶν. A passage, however, in the Homilies entirely relieves them
U||   from any charge of error. All that can be said is that they have
U||   employed ‘pattern’ in a somewhat unusual sense, but one which an
U||   analogous use of ‘copy’ in our own day sufficiently explains.
U||   Which priests serve unto the patron [ὑποδείγματι] and shadow of
U||   heavenly things.—Heb. viii. 5. Geneva.
U||   It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens
U||   should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with
U||   better sacrifices than these.—Heb. ix. 23. (A.V.)
U||   Where most rebellions and rebels be, there is the express similitude of
U||   hell, and the rebels themselves are the very[Pg 201] figures of fiends
U||   and devils; and their captain, the ungracious pattern of Lucifer and
U||   Satan, the prince of darkness.—Homilies, Against Wilful Rebellion.
U||   Peevish,     }
U||   Peevishness.
U||   By ‘peevishness’ we now understand a small but constantly fretting
U||   ill-temper; yet no one can read our old authors, with whom ‘peevish’
U||   and ‘peevishness’ are of constant recurrence, without feeling that
U||   their use of them is different from ours; although precisely to
U||   determine what their use was is anything but easy. Gifford (Massinger,
U||   vol. i. p. 71) says confidently, ‘peevish is foolish;’ but upon
U||   induction from an insufficient number of passages. ‘Peevish’ is rather
U||   self-willed, obstinate. That in a world like ours those who refuse to
U||   give up their own wills should be continually crossed, and thus should
U||   become fretful, and ‘peevish’ in our modern sense of the word, is
U||   inevitable; and here is the history of the change of meaning which it
U||   has undergone.
U||   Valentine. Cannot your grace win her to fancy him?
U||   Duke. No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
U||   Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty.
U||   Shakespeare, Two Gentlemen of Verona, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   We provoke, rail, scoff, calumniate, challenge, hate, abuse
U||   (hard-hearted, implacable, malicious, peevish, inexorable as we are),
U||   to satisfy our lust or private spleen.—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy,
U||   part iii. § 1.
U||   Pertinax hominum genus, a peevish generation of men.—Id., ib., part
U||   iii. § 4.
U||   That grand document of keeping to the light within us they [the
U||   Quakers] borrow out of St. John’s Gospel; and yet they are so frantic
U||   and peevish, that they would fling away the staff without which they
U||   are not able to make one step in religion.—H. More, Grand Mystery of
U||   Godliness, b. viii. c. 12.
U||   [Pg 202]
U||   In case the Romans, upon an inbred peevishness and engraffed
U||   pertinacity of theirs, should not hear reason, but refuse an
U||   indifferent end, then both God and man shall be witness as well of the
U||   moderation of Perseus, as of their pride and insolent
U||   frowardness.—Holland, Livy, p. 1152.
U||   We must carefully distinguish continuance in opinion from obstinacy,
U||   confidence of understanding from peevishness of affection, a not being
U||   convinced from a resolution never to be convinced.—Bishop Taylor,
U||   Liberty of Prophesying, § ii. 10.
U||   Pencil. The distinction between ‘pencil’ and paint-brush is quite
U||   modern. The older use of ‘pencil’ (‘penecillus,’ or little tail) was
U||   etymologically more correct than the modern; the brush being so called
U||   because it hung and drooped as does that.
U||   Heaven knows, they were besmeared and overstained
U||   With slaughter’s pencil, where revenge did paint
U||   The fearful difference of incensed kings.
U||   Shakespeare, King John, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   Learning is necessary to him [the heretic], if he trades in a critical
U||   error; but if he only broaches dregs, and deals in some dull sottish
U||   opinion, a trowel will serve as well as a pencil to daub on such thick
U||   coarse colours.—Fuller, Profane State, b. v. c. 10.
U||   The first thing she did after rising was to have recourse to the
U||   red-pot, out of which she laid it on very thick with a pencil, not only
U||   on her cheeks, chin, under the nose, above the eyebrows and edges of
U||   the ears, but also on the inside of her hands, her fingers, and
U||   shoulders.—The Lady’s Travels into Spain, Letter 8.
U||   Penitentiary. It is curious that this word has possessed three entirely
U||   independent meanings, namely penitent, ordainer of penances in the
U||   Church, and place for penitents; only the last is current now.
U||   [Pg 203]
U||   So Manasseh in the beginning and middle of his reign filled the city
U||   with innocent blood, and died a penitentiary.—Jackson, Christ’s Session
U||   at God’s Right Hand, b. ii. c. 42.
U||   ’Twas a French friar’s conceit that courtiers were of all men the
U||   likeliest to forsake the world and turn penitentiaries.—Hammond, The
U||   Seventh Sermon, Works, vol. iv. p. 517.
U||   Penitentiary, a priest that imposes upon an offender what penance he
U||   thinks fit.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   Pensive,     }
U||   Pensiveness.
U||   He is ‘pensive,’ according to our present estimate of the word, in whom
U||   a certain mild and meditative sadness finds place; and in thus
U||   attaching to the word this meaning of a thoughtful sadness we are truer
U||   to its etymology than were our ancestors, when they used it, as they
U||   often did, to express the sharpest anguish of grief. Thus, in my first
U||   quotation, by ‘the pensive court’ is meant the Court of David, which
U||   has just received tidings of the slaughter by Absalom of all the king’s
U||   sons.
U||   The pensive court in doleful dumps did rue
U||   This dismal case.
U||   Fuller, Poem on David’s hainous Sin.
U||   Great is the wit of pensiveness, and when the head is racked
U||   With hard misfortune sharp forecast of practice entereth in.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. vi.
U||   What is care and thought? a plain token of diffidence and distrust of
U||   God. It is an unfaithful care and pensiveness of the mind for meat,
U||   drink, clothing.—Becon, Works, vol. iii. p. 611.
U||   Penury. This expresses now no more than the objective fact of extreme
U||   poverty; an ethical subjective[Pg 204] meaning not lying in it, as
U||   would sometimes of old. This is now retained only in ‘penurious,’
U||   ‘penuriousness.’
U||   God sometimes punishes one sin with another; pride with adultery,
U||   drunkenness with murder, carelessness with irreligion, idleness with
U||   vanity, penury with oppression.—Bishop Taylor, The Faith and Patience
U||   of the Saints.
U||   [Perseverance. This word frequently occurs in literature of the
U||   sixteenth and seventeenth century in the sense of perception,
U||   discernment. ‘Perseverance’=discernment should be carefully
U||   distinguished from ‘perseverance’ (French perseverance, Latin
U||   perseverantia)=persistency, constancy. The former in many texts is
U||   spelt with a c instead of an s, as ‘perceverance,’ ‘perceyverance,’
U||   ‘perceiverance.’ This spelling gives the key to the etymology; the word
U||   is a derivative from Old French percevoir, percever=Latin percipere, to
U||   perceive. For a good collection of illustrative passages see Notes and
U||   Queries (1st S. vii. 400.)]
U||   If the dead have anie perceverance.
U||   Golding (see N. and Q.)
U||   She had more perceverance of the Hebrues law.—Langley’s Polidore
U||   Vergile (see N. and Q.)
U||   For his dyet he [Ariosto] was verie temperate, and a great enemie of
U||   excesse and surfetting, and so carelesse of delicates as though he had
U||   no perseverance in the tast of meates.—Sir J. Harington, Life of
U||   Ariosto, p. 418.
U||   He [Æmilius Paulus] suddenly fell into a raving (without any
U||   perseverance of sickness spied in him before, or any change or
U||   alteration in him [πρὶν αἰσθέσθαι καὶ νοῆσαι τὴν μεταβολήν]), and his
U||   wits went from him in such sort that he died three days after.—North,
U||   Plutarch’s Lives, p. 221.
U||   [Pg 205]
U||   Person. We have forfeited the full force of the statement, ‘God is no
U||   respecter of persons;’ from the fact that ‘person’ does not mean for us
U||   now all that it once meant. ‘Person,’ from ‘persona,’ the mask
U||   constantly worn by the actor of antiquity, is by natural transfer the
U||   part or rôle in the play which each sustains, as πρόσωπον is in Greek.
U||   In the great tragi-comedy of life each sustains a ‘person;’ one that of
U||   a king, another that of a peasant; one must play Dives, another
U||   Lazarus. This ‘person’ God, for whom the question is not what ‘person’
U||   each sustains, but how he sustains it, does not respect.
U||   King. What, rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison
U||   The immediate heir of England! was this easy?
U||   May this be washed in Lethe, and forgotten?
U||   Chief Justice. I then did use the person of your father;
U||   The image of his power lay then in me.
U||   Shakespeare, 2 Henry IV., act v. sc. 2.
U||   Cæsar also is brought in by Julian attributing to himself the honour
U||   (if it were at all an honour to that person which he sustained), of
U||   being the first that left his ship and took land.—Milton, History of
U||   England, b. ii.
U||   Her gifts
U||   Were such as under government well seemed;
U||   Unseemly to bear rule, which was thy part
U||   And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.
U||   Id., Paradise Lost, x. 153.
U||   Certain it is, that no man can long put on a person and act a part but
U||   his evil manners will peep through the corners of his white robe, and
U||   God will bring a hypocrite to shame even in the eyes of men.—Bishop
U||   Taylor, Apples of Sodom.
U||   Perspective. ‘Telescope’ and ‘microscope’ are both as old as Milton;
U||   but for a long while ‘perspective’ (glass being sometimes understood,
U||   and sometimes[Pg 206] expressed) did the work of these. It is sometimes
U||   written ‘prospective.’ Our present use of ‘perspective’ hardly dates
U||   farther back than Dryden.
U||   A guilty conscience
U||   Is a black register, wherein is writ
U||   All our good deeds and bad, a perspective
U||   That shows us hell.
U||   Webster, Duchess of Malfi, act iv. sc. 2.
U||   While we look for incorruption in the heavens, we find they are but
U||   like the earth, durable in their main bodies, alterable in their parts;
U||   whereof, beside comets and new stars, perspectives begin to tell tales;
U||   and the spots that wander about the sun, with Phaeton’s favour, would
U||   make clear conviction.—Sir T. Browne, Hydriotaphia.
U||   Look through faith’s perspective with the magnifying end on invisibles
U||   (for such is its frame, it lesseneth visibles), and thou wilt see
U||   sights not more strange than satisfying.—Whitlock, Zootomia, p. 535.
U||   A tiny mite, which we can scarcely see
U||   Without a perspective.
U||   Oldham, Eighth Satire of M. Boileau.
U||   Pert. This word had once the meaning of brisk, lively, nimble; now it
U||   is this with a very distinct subaudition of sauciness and impertinence
U||   as well.
U||   Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
U||   Awake the pert and nimble spirit of youth.
U||   Shakespeare, Midsummer Night’s Dream, act i. sc. 1.
U||   And on the tawny sands and shelves
U||   Trip the pert faeries and the dapper elves.
U||   Milton, Comus, 117.
U||   Pester. There is no greater discomfort or annoyance than extreme
U||   straitness or narrowness of room; out of which in Greek the word
U||   στενοχωρία,[Pg 207] signifying this, has come to have a secondary
U||   signification of trouble or anguish. [In English, ‘to pester’ bears
U||   witness to the same fact, having first the meaning of to encumber or
U||   clog, then the second meaning of painfully cooping-up in a narrow and
U||   confined space, and lastly the meaning of to vex or annoy, which sense
U||   it still retains.]
U||   Now because the most part of the people might not possibly have a sight
U||   of him, they gat up all at once into the theatre, and pestered it quite
U||   full.—Holland, Livy, p. 1055.
U||   They within, though pestered with their own numbers, stood to it like
U||   men resolved, and in a narrow compass did remarkable deeds.—Milton,
U||   History of England, b. ii.
U||   The calendar is filled, not to say pestered with them [that is, with
U||   Saints’ Days], jostling one another for room, many holding the same day
U||   in copartnership of festivity.—Fuller, Worthies of England, c. 3.
U||   Physical,   }
U||   Physically.
U||   Though ‘physical’ has not dissociated itself from ‘physics,’ it has
U||   from ‘physic’ and ‘physician,’ being used now as simply the equivalent
U||   for ‘natural’ which the Greek language has supplied us; but it was not
U||   always so.
U||   Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
U||   To walk unbracéd and suck up the humours
U||   Of the dank morning?
U||   Shakespeare, Julius Cæsar, act ii. sc. 1.
U||   Attalus, surnamed Philometer (to say, lover of his mother), would plant
U||   and set physical herbs, as helleborum.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 739.
U||   And for physic, he [Lord Bacon] did indeed live physically,[294]21 but
U||   not miserably.—Rawley, Life of Lord Bacon.
U||   [Pg 208]
U||   Placard. Formerly used often in the sense of a license or permission,
U||   the ‘placard’ being properly the broad tablet or board on which this,
U||   as well as other edicts and ordinances, was exposed.
U||   Then for my voice I must (no choice)
U||   Away of force, like posting horse,
U||   For sundry men had placards then
U||   Such child to take.
U||   Tusser, Author’s Life.
U||   Others are of the contrary opinion, and that Christianity gives us a
U||   placard to use these sports; and that man’s charter of dominion over
U||   the creatures enables him to employ them as well for pleasure as
U||   necessity.—Fuller, Holy State, b. iii. c. 13.
U||   Plantation. We still ‘plant’ a colony, but a ‘plantation’ is now of
U||   trees only; and not of men. There was a time when ‘The Plantations’ was
U||   the standing name by which our transatlantic colonies were known. One
U||   of Bacon’s state-papers has this title, ‘Certain Considerations
U||   touching the Plantation in Ireland.’
U||   It is a shameful and unblessed thing to take the scum of people and
U||   wicked condemned men to be the people with whom you plant: and not only
U||   so, but it spoileth the plantation.—Lord Bacon, Essays, 33.
U||   Plantations make mankind broader, as generation makes it
U||   thicker.—Fuller, Holy State, b. iii. c. 16.
U||   Platform. This word has lost much of its meaning, that is in England;
U||   for it is very far from having so done in America. The only ‘platforms’
U||   which we know of here are structures of boards erected to serve a
U||   temporary need. But a ‘platform’ was once a scheme or pattern on which,
U||   as on a ground-plan,[Pg 209] other things, moral or material, might be
U||   disposed. Statesmen had their ‘platform’ of policy; Churches their
U||   ‘platform’ of doctrine and discipline; and so is it still in America,
U||   where the word is in constant use.
U||   They, [the courtiers of Dionysius] were every one occupied about
U||   drawing the platform of Sicilia, telling the nature of the Sicilian
U||   Sea, and reckoning up the havens and places looking towards
U||   Africk.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 456.
U||   The platform of this Tabernacle was by God delivered to Moses on the
U||   Mount, with a strict charge to make all things conformable
U||   thereunto.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. iv. c. 4.
U||   Plausible,    }
U||   Plausibly,
U||   Plausibility.
U||   That is ‘plausible’ now which presents itself as worthy of applause;
U||   yet always with a subaudition, or at least a suggestion, that it is not
U||   so really; it was once that which obtained applause, with at least the
U||   primâ facie likelihood that the applause which it obtained was
U||   deserved.
U||   This John Bishop of Constantinople, that assumed to himself the title
U||   of Universal Bishop or Patriarch, was a good man, given greatly to alms
U||   and fasting, but too much addicted to advance the title of his see;
U||   which made a plausible bishop seem to be Antichrist to Gregory the
U||   Great.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part ii. p. 66.
U||   The Romans plausibly did give consent
U||   For Tarquin’s everlasting banishment.
U||   Shakespeare, Lucrece, 1854.
U||   He was no sooner in sight than every one received him plausibly, and
U||   with great submission and reverence.—Stubbes, Anatomy of Abuses, p. 17.
U||   Being placed in the upper part of the world, [he] carried on his
U||   dignity with that justice, modesty, integrity, fidelity, and other
U||   gracious plausibilities, that in a place of trust he[Pg 210] contented
U||   those whom he could not satisfy, and in a place of envy procured the
U||   love of those who emulated his greatness.—Vaughan, Life and Death of
U||   Dr. Jackson.
U||   Poach,   }
U||   Poacher.
U||   A ‘poacher’ is strictly speaking an intruder; one who intrudes or
U||   ‘poaches’ into land where he has no business; the fact that he does so
U||   with intention of spoiling the game is superadded, not lying in the
U||   word.
U||   Pocher le labeur d’autruy. To poch into, or incroach upon another man’s
U||   imployment, practise or trade.—Cotgrave.
U||   So that, to speak truly, they [the Spaniards] have rather poached and
U||   offered at a number of enterprises, than maintained any
U||   constantly.—Lord Bacon, Notes of a Speech concerning a War with Spain.
U||   It is ill conversing with an ensnarer, delving into the bottom of your
U||   mind, to know what is hid in it. I would ask a casuist if it were not
U||   lawful for me not only to hide my mind, but to cast something that is
U||   not true before such a poacher.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams,
U||   part ii. p. 113.
U||   Polite,   }
U||   Politely.
U||   Between ‘polite’ and ‘polished’ this much of difference has now grown
U||   up and established itself, that ‘polite’ is always employed in a
U||   secondary and tropical sense, having reference to the polish of the
U||   mind, while it is free to use ‘polished’ in the literal and figurative
U||   sense alike.
U||   Polite bodies, as looking-glasses.—Cudworth, Intellectual System, p.
U||   731.
U||   Polite; well-polished, neat.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   In things artificial seldom any elegance is wrought without a
U||   superfluous waste and refuse in the transaction. No[Pg 211] marble
U||   statue can be politely carved, no fair edifice built, without almost as
U||   much rubbish and sweeping.—Milton, Reason of Church Government, b. i.
U||   c. 7.
U||   Politics,   }
U||   Politician.
U||   At the present ‘politics’ are always things, but were sometimes persons
U||   as well in times past. ‘Politician’ too had an evil subaudition. One so
U||   named was a trickster or underhand self-seeker and schemer in politics,
U||   or it might be, as it is throughout in the sermon of South, quoted
U||   below, in the ordinary affairs of life. Fuller calls his Life of the
U||   wicked usurper Andronicus, ‘The Unfortunate Politician.’
U||   It did in particular exasperate Tacitus, and other politicks of his
U||   temper, to see so many natural Romans renounce their name and country
U||   for maintenance of Jewish religion.—Jackson, The Eternal Truth of
U||   Scriptures, b. i. c. 20.
U||   Let them [spiritual persons] have the diligence and craft of fishers,
U||   the watchfulness and the care of shepherds, the prudence of politics,
U||   the tenderness of parents.—Bishop Taylor, Life of Christ, part ii. §
U||   12.
U||   If this arch-politician [the Devil] find in his pupils any remorse, any
U||   feeling or fear of God’s future judgment, he persuades them that God
U||   hath so great need of men’s souls that He will accept them at any time
U||   and upon any conditions.—Sir W. Raleigh, History of the World, b. i. c.
U||   7, § 9.
U||   Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with rods,
U||   Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
U||   Of this vile politician Bolingbroke.
U||   Shakespeare, 1 Henry IV., act i. sc. 3.
U||   A politician is the devil’s quilted anvil;
U||   He fashions all sins on him and the blows
U||   Are never heard.
U||   Webster, Duchess of Malfi, act iii. sc. 2.
U||   [Pg 212]
U||   The politician, whose very essence lies in this, that he is a person
U||   ready to do anything that he apprehends for his advantage, must first
U||   of all be sure to put himself in a state of liberty, as free and large
U||   as his principles, and so to provide elbow-room enough for his
U||   conscience to lay about it, and have its full play in.—South, Sermons,
U||   1744, vol. i. p. 324.
U||   Pomp,      }
U||   Pompous,
U||   Pompously.
U||   ‘Pomp’ is one of the many words which Milton employs with a strict
U||   classical accuracy, so that he is only to be perfectly understood when
U||   we keep in mind that a ‘pomp’ with him is always πομπή, a procession.
U||   He is not, however, singular here, as he often is, in the stricter use
U||   of a word. It is easy to perceive how ‘pomp’ obtained its wider
U||   application. There is no such favourable opportunity for the display of
U||   state and magnificence as a procession; this is almost the inevitable
U||   form which they take; and thus the word first applied to the most
U||   frequent display of these, came afterwards to be transferred to every
U||   display. In respect to ‘pompous’ and ‘pompously’ there is something
U||   else to note. There is in them always now the suggestion of that which
U||   is more in show than in substance, or, at any rate, of a magnificence
U||   which, if real, is yet vaingloriously and ostentatiously displayed. But
U||   they did not convey, and were not intended to convey, any such
U||   impression once.
U||   [Antiochus] also provided a great number of bulls with gilt horns, the
U||   which he conducted himself with a goodly pomp and procession to the
U||   very gate of the city [ἄχρι τῶν πυλῶν ἐπόμπευσε].—Holland, Plutarch’s
U||   Morals, p. 417.
U||   With goddess-like demeanour forth she went,
U||   Not unattended; for on her, as queen,
U||   A pomp of winning Graces waited still.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, viii. 59.
U||   The planets in their stations listening stood,
U||   [Pg 213]
U||   While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.
U||   Id., ib. vii. 563.
U||   What pompous powers of ravishment were here,[295]22
U||   What delicate extremities of pleasure.
U||   Beaumont, Psyche, can. xv. st. 299.
U||   All expresses related that the entertainment [of Prince Charles at
U||   Madrid] was very pompous and kingly.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop
U||   Williams, part i. p. 119.
U||   He [Hardecnute] gave his sister Gunildis, a virgin of rare beauty, in
U||   marriage to Henry the Alman Emperor; and to send her forth pompously,
U||   all the nobility contributed their jewels and richest
U||   ornaments.—Milton, History of England, b. vi.
U||   Popular,    }
U||   Popularity.
U||   He was ‘popular’ once, not who had acquired, but who was laying himself
U||   out to acquire, the favour of the people. ‘Popularity’ was the wooing,
U||   not, as now, the having won, that favour; exactly the Latin ‘ambitio.’
U||   The word, which is passive now, was active then.
U||   Of a senator he [Manlius] became popular, and began to break his mind
U||   and impart his designs unto the magistrates of the commons, finding
U||   fault with the nobility.—Holland, Livy, 224.
U||   And oft in vain his name they closely bite,
U||   As popular and flatterer accusing.
U||   P. Fletcher, Purple Island, c. 10.
U||   Divers were of opinion that he [Caius Gracchus] was more popular and
U||   desirous of the common people’s good will and favour than his brother
U||   had been before him. But indeed he was clean contrary.—North,
U||   Plutarch’s Lives, p 690.
U||   [Pg 214]
U||   Cato the Younger charged Muræna, and indited him in open court for
U||   popularity and ambition.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 243.
U||   Harold, lifted up in mind, and forgetting now his former shows of
U||   popularity, defrauded his soldiers their due and well-deserved share of
U||   the spoils.—Milton, History of England, b. vi.
U||   Portly,     }
U||   Portliness.
U||   There lies in ‘portly’ a certain sense of dignity of demeanour still,
U||   but always connoted with this a cumbrousness and weight, such as
U||   Spenser in his noble Epithalamion (see below) would never have ascribed
U||   to his bride, nor Shakespeare to the swift-footed Achilles (Troilus and
U||   Cressida, act iv. sc. 5), or to the youthful Romeo.
U||   The chief and most portly person of them all was one Hasdrubal
U||   [Insignis tamen inter ceteros Hasdrubal erat].—Holland, Livy, p. 7.
U||   He [Romeo] bears him like a portly gentleman.
U||   Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, act i. sc. 5.
U||   Rudely thou wrongest my deare hart’s desire,
U||   In finding fault with her too portly pride;
U||   For in those lofty lookes is close implide
U||   Scorn of base things and ’sdeigne of foule dishonor,
U||   Such pride is praise; such portlinesse is honor.
U||   Spenser, Sonnet 5.
U||   Pragmatical. This is always employed at the present in an ill sense;
U||   the ‘pragmatical’ man is not merely busy, but over-busy, officious,
U||   meddling; nay, more than this, with an assumption of bustling
U||   self-importance. The word’s etymology does not require this ill sense,
U||   which is merely superinduced upon it, and from which it was not indeed
U||   always, but often free in its earlier use.
U||   [Pg 215]
U||   It may appear at the first a new and unwonted argument, to teach men
U||   how to raise and make their fortune; but the handling thereof
U||   concerneth learning greatly both in honour and in substance. In honour,
U||   because pragmatical men may not go away with an opinion that learning
U||   is like a lark, that can mount and sing and please herself, and nothing
U||   else; but may know that she holdeth as well of the hawk, that can soar
U||   aloft, and also descend and strike upon the prey.—Lord Bacon,
U||   Advancement of Learning, b. ii.
U||   We cannot always be contemplative or pragmatical abroad; but have need
U||   of some delightful intermissions wherein the enlarged soul may leave
U||   off her severe schooling.—Milton, Tetrachordon.
U||   Preposterous,   }
U||   Preposterously.
U||   A word nearly or quite unserviceable now, being merely an ungraceful
U||   and slipshod synonym for absurd. But restore and confine it to its old
U||   use and to one peculiar branch of absurdity, the reversing of the true
U||   order and method of things, the putting of the last first, and the
U||   first last, and of what excellent service it would be capable!
U||   It is a preposterous order to teach first, and to learn after.—The
U||   Translators [of the Bible, 1611] to the Reader.
U||   King Asa justly received little benefit by them [physicians], because
U||   of his preposterous addressing himself to them before he went to God (2
U||   Chron. xvi. 12).—Fuller, Worthies of England, c. ix.
U||   To reason thus, I am of the elect, I therefore have saving faith, and
U||   the rest of the sanctifying qualities, therefore that which I do is
U||   good: thus I say to reason is very preposterous. We must go a quite
U||   contrary course, and thus reason: my life is good ... I therefore have
U||   the gifts of sanctification, and therefore am of God’s elect.—Hales,
U||   Sermon on St. Peter’s Fall.
U||   Some indeed preposterously misplace these, and make us partake of the
U||   benefit of Christ’s priestly office in the forgiveness[Pg 216] of our
U||   sins and our reconcilement to God, before we are brought under the
U||   sceptre of his kingly office by our obedience.—South, Sermons, 1744,
U||   vol. xi. p. 3.
U||   Pretend,    }
U||   Pretence,
U||   Pretension.
U||   To charge one with ‘pretending’ anything is now a much more serious
U||   charge than it was once. Indeed it was not necessarily, and only by
U||   accident, a charge at all. That was ‘pretended’ which one stretched out
U||   before himself and in face of others: but whether it was the thing it
U||   affirmed itself to be, or, as at present, only a deceitful resemblance
U||   of this, the word did not decide. While it was thus with ‘to pretend,’
U||   there was as yet no distinction recognized between ‘pretence’ and
U||   ‘pretension;’ they both signified the act of ‘pretending,’ or the thing
U||   ‘pretended;’ but whether truly or falsely it was left to the context,
U||   or to the judgment of the reader, to decide. ‘Pretence’ has since
U||   followed the fortunes of ‘pretend,’ and has fallen with it; while
U||   ‘pretension’ has disengaged itself from being a merely useless synonym
U||   of ‘pretence,’ and, retaining its relation to the earlier uses of the
U||   verb, now signifies a claim put forward which may or may not be valid,
U||   the word leaving this for other considerations to determine. Louis
U||   Napoleon assumed the dictatorship under the ‘pretence’ of resisting
U||   anarchy; the House of Orleans had ‘pretensions’ to the throne of
U||   France. But these distinctions are quite modern.
U||   Being preferred by King James to the bishopric of Chichester, and
U||   pretending his own imperfectness and insufficiency to undergo such a
U||   charge, he caused to be engraven about the seal of his bishopric, those
U||   words of St. Paul, Et[Pg 217] ad hæc quis idoneus?—Isaacson, Life and
U||   Death of Lancelot Andrewes.
U||   [The Sabbath] is rather hominis gratiâ quam Dei; and though God’s
U||   honour is mainly pretended in it, yet it is man’s happiness that is
U||   really intended by it, even of God Himself.—H. More, Grand Mystery of
U||   Godliness, b. viii. c. 13.
U||   I come no enemy, but to set free
U||   From out this dark and dismal house of pain
U||   Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host
U||   Of Spirits, that, in our just pretences armed,
U||   Fell with us from on high.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, ii. 822; cf. vi. 421.
U||   This is the tree whose leaves were intended for the healing of the
U||   nations, not for a pretence and palliation for sin.—H. More, Grand
U||   Mystery of Godliness, b. viii. c. 1.
U||   He [the Earl of Pembroke] was exceedingly beloved in the Court, because
U||   he never desired to get that for himself which others laboured for; but
U||   was still ready to promote the pretences of worthy men.—Clarendon,
U||   History of the Rebellion, b. i. c. 121.
U||   It is either secret pride, or base faintness of heart, or dull sloth,
U||   or some other thing, and not true modesty in us if being excellently
U||   gifted for some weighty employment in every other man’s judgment, we
U||   yet withdraw ourselves from it with pretensions of
U||   unsufficiency.—Sanderson, Sermons, 1671, p. 208.
U||   Prevaricate,   }
U||   Prevarication.
U||   This verb, often now very loosely used, had once a very definite
U||   meaning of its own. ‘To prevaricate’ is to betray the cause which one
U||   affects to sustain, the prevaricator is the feint pleader, as he used
U||   to be called, and, so far as I know, the words are always so used by
U||   our early writers. We have inherited the word from the Latin
U||   law-courts, which borrowed it from the life. The ‘prævaricator’ being
U||   one who halted on[Pg 218] two unequal legs, the name was transferred to
U||   him who, affecting to prosecute a charge, was in secret collusion with
U||   the opposite party, and so managed the cause as to ensure his escape.
U||   Observe in the two following passages the accuracy of use which so
U||   habitually distinguishes our writers of the seventeenth century as
U||   compared with too many of the nineteenth.
U||   I proceed now to do the same service for the divines of England; whom
U||   you question first in point of learning and sufficiency, and then in
U||   point of conscience and honesty, as prevaricating in the religion which
U||   they profess, and inclining to Popery.—Chillingworth, Religion of
U||   Protestants, Preface, p. 11.
U||   If we be not all enemies to God in this kind [in a direct opposition],
U||   yet in adhering to the enemy we are enemies; in our prevarications, and
U||   easy betrayings and surrendering of ourselves to the enemy of his
U||   kingdom, Satan, we are his enemies.—Donne, On the Nativity. Sermon 7.
U||   Prevent,    }
U||   Prevention.
U||   One may reach a point before another to help or to hinder him there;
U||   may anticipate his arrival either with the purpose of keeping it for
U||   him, or keeping it against him. ‘To prevent’ has slipped by very
U||   gradual degrees, which it would not be difficult to trace, from the
U||   sense of keeping for to that of keeping against, from the sense of
U||   arriving first with the intention of helping, to that of arriving first
U||   with the intention of hindering, and then generally from helping to
U||   hindering.
U||   So it is, that if Titus had not prevented the whole multitude of people
U||   which came to see him, and if he had not got him away betimes, before
U||   the games were ended, he had hardly escaped from being stifled amongst
U||   them.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 321.
U||   [Pg 219]
U||   Gentlemen that were brought low, not by their vices, but by misfortune,
U||   poveri vergognosi as the Tuscan calls them, bashful, and could not
U||   crave though they perished, he prevented their modesty, and would
U||   heartily thank those that discovered their commiserable condition to
U||   him.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part i. p. 201.
U||   That poor man had waited thirty and eight years [at the pool of
U||   Bethesda], and still was prevented by some other.—Bishop Taylor, Life
U||   of Christ, part iii. § 13.
U||   There he beheld how humbly diligent
U||   New Adulation was to be at hand;
U||   How ready Falsehood stept; how nimbly went
U||   Base pick-thank Flattery, and prevents command.
U||   Daniel, Civil Wars, b. ii. st. 56.
U||   Half way he met
U||   His daring foe, at this prevention more
U||   Incensed.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, vi. 129.
U||   Probable. Already in the best classical Latin ‘probabilis’ had passed
U||   over into the secondary meaning of ‘probatus;’ thus ‘probabilis orator’
U||   (Cicero) is an approved orator. ‘Probable’ is often so used by our
U||   scholarly writers of the seventeenth century; though we now use it only
U||   in its original sense of ‘likely.’ On the distinction between
U||   ‘probable’ and ‘likely,’ ‘probability’ and ‘likelihood,’ see Garden,
U||   Dictionary of Philosophical Terms.
U||   The Lord Bacon would have rewards given to those men who in the quest
U||   of natural experiments make probable mistakes. An ingenious miss is of
U||   more credit than a bungling casual hit.—Fuller, Mixt Contemplations, i.
U||   26.
U||   S. Ambrose, who was a good probable doctor, and one as fit to be relied
U||   on as any man else, hath these words.—Bishop Taylor, Doctrine and
U||   Practice of Repentance, Preface.
U||   [Pg 220]
U||   Probation. This is strictly speaking = δοκιμή, the process of proving;
U||   as ‘proof’ is = δοκίμιον or δοκιμεῖον, that by which this proving is
U||   carried out; thus toil is the δοκίμιον of soldiers (Herodian); and we
U||   now very properly keep the words apart according to this rule; but
U||   formerly this was not so.
U||   He, sir, was lapped
U||   In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
U||   Of his queen-mother, which for more probation
U||   I can with ease produce.
U||   Shakespeare, Cymbeline, act v. sc. 5.
U||   Also Philip the Evangelist had three daughters. Neither can it help to
U||   say that these children were born before his election; for this is but
U||   a simple saying, and no probation.—Frith, Works, 1572, p. 325.
U||   Prodigious. This notes little now but magnitude. Truer to its etymology
U||   once (from ‘prodigium’ = prōd + agium from ajo, see Brugmann, § 509),
U||   it signified the ominous or ominously prophetic.
U||   Blood shall put out your torches, and instead
U||   Of gaudy flowers about your wanton necks,
U||   An axe shall hang, like a prodigious meteor,
U||   Ready to crop your loves’ sweets.
U||   Beaumont and Fletcher, Philaster, act v. sc. 1.
U||   Without this comely ornament of hair, their [women’s] most glorious
U||   beauty appears as deformed, as the sun would be prodigious without
U||   beams.—Fuller, The Profane State, b. v. c. 5.
U||   I began to reflect on the whole life of this prodigious man.—Cowley, On
U||   the Government of Oliver Cromwell.
U||   Promote,   }
U||   Promoter,
U||   Promotion.
U||   ‘To promote,’ that is, to further or set forward, a ‘promoter,’ a
U||   furtherer, are now words of harmless, often of quite an honourable,
U||   signification. They were once[Pg 221] terms of extremest scorn; a
U||   ‘promoter’ being a common informer, and so called because he ‘promoted’
U||   charges and accusations against men (promotor litium: Skinner).
U||   There lack men to promote the king’s officers when they do amiss, and
U||   to promote all offenders.—Latimer, Last Sermon before Edward VI.
U||   Thou, Linus, that lov’st still to be promoting,
U||   Because I sport about King Henry’s marriage,
U||   Think’st this will prove a matter worth the carriage.
U||   Sir J. Harington, Epigrams, ii. 98.
U||   Aristogiton the sycophant, or false promoter, was condemned to death
U||   for troubling men with wrongful imputations.—Holland, Plutarch’s
U||   Morals, p. 421.
U||   His eyes be promoters, some trespass to spy.
U||   Tusser, Of an envious and haughty Neighbour.
U||   Promoters be those which in popular and penal actions do defer the
U||   names or complain of offenders, having part of the profit for their
U||   reward.—Cowell, The Interpreter, s. v.
U||   Covetousness and promotion and such like are that right hand and right
U||   eye which must be cut off and plucked out, that the whole man perish
U||   not.—Tyndale, Exposition of the Sixth Chap. of Matthew.
U||   Propriety. All ‘propriety’ is now mental or moral; where material
U||   things are concerned, we employ ‘property,’ at the first no more than a
U||   different spelling or slightly different form of the same word.
U||   But some man haply will say, That where private propriety is in place,
U||   public community is turned out of doors. Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p.
U||   680.
U||   He [the good servant] provides good bounds and sufficient fences
U||   betwixt his own and his master’s estate (Jacob, Gen. xxx. 36, set his
U||   flock three days’ journey from Laban’s), that no quarrel may arise
U||   about their propriety, nor suspicion[Pg 222] that his remnant hath
U||   eaten up his master’s whole cloth.—Fuller, The Holy State, b. i. c. 8.
U||   Hail, wedded love, mysterious law, true source
U||   Of human offspring, sole propriety
U||   In Paradise of all things common else.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, iv. 751.
U||   A propriety is nothing else but jus ad rem, when a man doth claim such
U||   a thing as his own, and has a power to use it and dispose of it in a
U||   lawful way for his own benefit and advantage.—Strong, Of the Two
U||   Covenants, b. iii. c. 1.
U||   Prose,  }
U||   Proser.
U||   ‘To prose’ is now to talk or to write heavily, tediously, without
U||   spirit and without animation; but ‘to prose’ was once the antithesis of
U||   to versify, and a ‘proser’ of a writer in metre. In the tacit
U||   assumption that vigour, animation, rapid movement, with all the
U||   precipitation of the spirit, belong to verse rather than to prose, lies
U||   the explanation of the changed uses of the words.
U||   It was found that whether ought was imposed me by them that had the
U||   overlooking, or betaken to of mine own choice in English or other
U||   tongue, prosing or versing, but chiefly this latter, the style, by
U||   certain vital signs it had, was likely to live.—Milton, Reason of
U||   Church Government, b. ii.
U||   And surely Nash, though he a proser were,
U||   A branch of laurel yet deserves to bear.
U||   Drayton, On Poets and Poesy.
U||   Prune. At present we only ‘prune’ trees; but our earlier authors use
U||   the word where we should use ‘preen,’ which indeed is but another form
U||   of the word. With us only birds ‘preen’ their feathers, while women, as
U||   in the example which follows, might ‘prune’ themselves of old.
U||   [Pg 223]
U||   A husband that loveth to trim and pamper his body, causeth his wife by
U||   that means to study nothing else but the tricking and pruning of
U||   herself.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 318.
U||   Publican. Formerly one who gathered the taxes, and paid them into the
U||   publicum or treasury; but now—though, as Johnson assures us, ‘in low
U||   language’—a man that keeps a house of public entertainment.
U||   The late king’s extorting publicans (whereof Ranolf Flambard, Bishop of
U||   Durham, the principal) were closely imprisoned.—Fuller, Church History,
U||   ii. 3, 13.
U||   They would not suffer him to take that money out of the treasury which
U||   was pressed and ready for him, but assigned and ordained certain moneys
U||   from the publicans and farmers of the city’s customs and revenues to
U||   furnish him.—Holland, Plutarch, p. 435.
U||   Pulpit. We distinguish now between the ‘pulpit’ and the rostrum; our
U||   ancestors did not so.
U||   I will myself into the pulpit first,
U||   And show the reason of our Cæsar’s death.
U||   Shakespeare, Julius Cæsar, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   He [Cicero] said that those orators who used to strain their voices and
U||   cry aloud in the pulpit were privy to their own weakness and
U||   insufficience otherwise.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 439.
U||   Punctual,   }
U||   Punctually.
U||   ‘This word is now confined to the meagre denoting of accuracy in
U||   respect to time—fidelity to the precise moment of an appointment. But
U||   originally it was just as often and just as reasonably applied to space
U||   as to time. Nor only was it applied to time and space, but it had a
U||   large and very elegant figurative use’ (De[Pg 224] Quincey, Note Book).
U||   Thus a ‘punctual’ narration was a narration which entered into minuter
U||   points of detail.
U||   The stars that seem to roll
U||   ... merely to officiate light
U||   Round this opacous earth, this punctual spot.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, viii. 19-23.
U||   Truly I thought I could not be too punctual in describing the animal
U||   life, it being so serviceable for our better understanding the
U||   divine.—H. More, Grand Mystery of Godliness, Preface, p. x.
U||   All curious solicitude about riches smells of avarice; even the very
U||   disposing of it with a too punctual and artificial liberality is not
U||   worth a painful solicitude.—Cotton, Montaigne’s Essays, b. iii. c. 9.
U||   Every one is to give a reason of his faith; but priests or ministers
U||   more punctually than any.—H. More, Grand Mystery of Godliness, b. x. c.
U||   12.
U||   Puny. The present use of ‘puny,’ as that which is at once weak and
U||   small, is only secondary and inferential. ‘Puny’ or ‘puisne’ (puis né)
U||   is born after another, therefore younger; and only by inference smaller
U||   and weaker.
U||   It were a sign of ignorant arrogancy, if punies or freshmen should
U||   reject the axioms and principles of Aristotle, usual in the schools,
U||   because they have some reasons against them which themselves cannot
U||   answer.—Jackson, The Eternal Truth of Scriptures, c. i.
U||   [The worthy soldier] had rather others should make a ladder of his dead
U||   corpse to scale a city by it, than a bridge of him whilst alive for his
U||   punies to give him the go-by, and pass over him to preferment.—Fuller,
U||   Holy State, b. iv. c. 17.
U||   He is dead and buried, and by this time no puny among the mighty
U||   nations of the dead; for though he left this[Pg 225] world not very
U||   many days past, yet every hour, you know, addeth largely unto that dark
U||   society.—Sir T. Browne, Letter to a Friend, p. 1.
U||   Purchase. Now always to acquire in exchange for money, to buy; but much
U||   oftener in our old writers simply to acquire, being properly to hunt,
U||   ‘pourchasser;’ and then to take in hunting; then to acquire; and then,
U||   as the commonest way of acquiring is by giving money in exchange, to
U||   buy. The word occurs six times in our Version of the New Testament,
U||   Acts i. 18; viii. 10; xx. 28; Ephes. i. 14; 1 Tim. iii. 13; 1 Pet. ii.
U||   9, margin; in none of these is the notion of buying involved. At Acts
U||   i. 18, this is especially noteworthy. It is there said: ‘This man
U||   purchased a field with the reward of iniquity.’ There will always
U||   remain certain difficulties in reconciling the different records of the
U||   death of Judas; but if St. Peter had here affirmed that Judas had
U||   bought this field of blood, these difficulties would be seriously
U||   increased, for the chief priests were the actual buyers (Matt. xxvii.
U||   7). He affirms no such thing, neither did our Translators understand
U||   him to do so, but simply that Judas made that ominous potter’s field
U||   his own (ἐκτήσατο). The Revised Version has ‘obtained.’
U||   And therefore true consideration of estate can hardly find what to
U||   reject, in matter of territory, in any empire, except it be some
U||   glorious acquists obtained sometime in the bravery of wars, which
U||   cannot be kept without excessive charge and trouble, of which kind were
U||   the purchases of King Henry VIII., that of Tournay, and that of
U||   Bologne.—Bacon, History of King Henry VII.
U||   The purchases of our own industry are joined commonly with labour and
U||   strife.—Id., Colours of Good and Evil, 9.
U||   [Pg 226]
U||   Meditation considers anything that may best make us to avoid the place
U||   and to quit a vicious habit, or master and rectify an untoward
U||   inclination, or purchase a virtue or exercise one.—Bishop Taylor, Life
U||   of Christ, part i. § 5.
U||   [Men] will repent, but not restore; they will say Nollem factum, they
U||   wish they had never done it; but since it is done, you must give them
U||   leave to rejoice in their purchase.—Id., Sermon preached to the
U||   University of Dublin.
U||   As it is a happiness for us to purchase friends, so is it misery to
U||   lose them.—Reynolds, God’s Revenge against Murther, b. v. hist. 21.
U||   Pursuer. ‘Pursue’ and ‘pursuer’ are older words in the language than
U||   ‘persecute’ and ‘persecutor’—earlier adoptions of ‘persequor’ and
U||   ‘persecutor,’ through Old French and not immediately from the Latin.
U||   Besides the meaning which they still retain, they once also covered the
U||   meanings which these later words have, since their introduction,
U||   appropriated as exclusively their own. In Scotch law the prosecutor is
U||   the ‘pursuer,’ ὁ διώκων.
U||   That first was a blaspheme and pursuere.—1 Tim. i. 13. Wiclif.
U||   If God leave them in this hardness of heart, they may prove as
U||   desperate opposites and pursuers of all grace, of Christ and
U||   Christians, as the most horrible open swine, as we see in Saul and
U||   Julian.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 106.
U||   Quaint,   }
U||   Quaintly.
U||   In ‘quaint,’ which is the Middle English ‘quaynt,’ ‘queynt,’ ‘coint,’
U||   Old French ‘cointe,’ the same word as the Latin ‘cognitum,’ there lies
U||   always now the notion of a certain curiosity and oddness, however these
U||   may be subordinated to ends of beauty and grace, and indeed[Pg 227] may
U||   themselves be made to contribute to these ends: pretty after some
U||   bygone standard of prettiness; but all this is of late introduction
U||   into the word, which had once simply the meaning of neat, graceful,
U||   skilful, subtle, knowing.
U||   O britel joye, O sweete venym queynte,
U||   O monstre that so subtily canst peynte
U||   Thyn giftes, under hiew of stedfastnesse,
U||   That thou desceyuest bothe more and lesse.
U||   Chaucer, The Marchaundes Tale (Morris, ii. p. 343).
U||   I grant, my Lord, the damsel is as fair
U||   As simple Suffolk’s homely towns can yield,
U||   But in the court be quainter dames than she.
U||   Greene, Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay, sc. 1.
U||   But you, my lord, were glad to be employed,
U||   To show how quaint an orator you are.
U||   Shakespeare, 2 Henry VI., act iii. sc. 2.
U||   Whom evere I schal kisse, he it is; holde ye him, and lede ye warli, or
U||   queyntly.—Mark xiv. 44. Wiclif (earlier version).
U||   A ladder quaintly made of cords.
U||   Shakespeare, Two Gentlemen of Verona, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   Querulous. Not formerly, as now, addicted to the making of complaints,
U||   but quarrelsome.
U||   There inhabit these regions a kind of people, rude, warlike, ready to
U||   fight, querulous, and mischievous.—Holland, Camden’s Scotland, p. 39.
U||   Not querulous, or clamorous in his discourse; ‘He shall not strive nor
U||   cry, neither shall any hear his voice in the streets;’ but meek and
U||   quiet.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. iii. c. 6.
U||   Race. Formerly ‘race,’ the Old French ‘raïs,’ the same word as the
U||   Latin ‘radicem,’ was used in the sense of a root.
U||   A race of ginger.—Shakespeare, Winter’s Tale, act iv. sc. 3.
U||   [Pg 228]
U||   Raisin. It is conveniently agreed now that ‘raisin’ shall be employed
U||   only of the dried grape, but this does not lie in ‘racemus,’ of which
U||   ‘raisin’ is the French equivalent, nor yet in its earlier uses; indeed,
U||   ‘raisins of the sun’ (Sir J. Harington) was a phrase commonly employed
U||   when the dried fruit was intended.
U||   Nether in the vyneyerd thou schalt gadere reysyns and greynes fallynge
U||   doun, but thou schalt leeve to be gaderid of pore men and
U||   pilgryms.—Lev. xix. 10. Wiclif.
U||   Rascal,    }
U||   Rascality.
U||   The lean unseasonable members of the herd of deer were formerly so
U||   called; then the common people, the plebs as distinguished from the
U||   populus; it is only in comparatively modern English that the word is
U||   one of moral contempt. [In Anglo-French the word ‘rascaille’ was used
U||   in the sense of a rabble; for references and etymology see
U||   Mayhew-Skeat, Dict. of Middle English.]
U||   And he smoot of the puple seventi men, and fifti thousandis of the
U||   raskeyl [Et percussit de populo septuaginta viros et quinquaginta
U||   millia plebis (Vulg.)].—1 Kin. vi. 19. Wiclif.
U||   The common priests be not so obedient unto their ordinaryes that they
U||   will pay money except they know why. Now it is not expedient that every
U||   rascal should know the secretes of the very true cause, for many
U||   considerations.—Tyndale, The Practice of Popishe Prelates.
U||   Now shall I tel you which ben bestes of chace;
U||   And ye shall, my dere sones, other bestes all,
U||   Whereso ye hem finde, rascall hem call.
U||   Juliana Berners, The Book of St. Albans.
U||   As one should in reproach say to a poor man, Thou raskall knave, where
U||   raskall is properly the hunter’s term given to[Pg 229] young deer, lean
U||   and out of season, and not to people.—Puttenham, Art of English Poesy,
U||   1811, p. 150.
U||   Both sorts of seasoned deer,
U||   Here walk the stately red, the freckled fallow there;
U||   The bucks and lusty stags among the rascals strewed,
U||   As sometimes gallant spirits amongst the multitude.
U||   Drayton, Polyolbion, song 13.
U||   The report which these roving hunters had made to their countrymen of
U||   that pleasant land, did invite the chief heads of their clans, with
U||   their several rascalities, to flock into Europe, like beggars dismissed
U||   out of prison, invited to a solemn banquet.—Jackson, A Treatise on the
U||   Divine Essence, b. vi. c. 25, § 6.
U||   Rather. This survives for us now only as an adverb, but meets us often
U||   in Middle English as an adjective, as the comparative of ‘rathe,’
U||   quick, swift, early.
U||   This is he that Y seide of, aftir me is comun a man, which was maad
U||   bifor me; for he was rather than Y [quia prior me erat, Vulg.].—John i.
U||   30. Wiclif.
U||   If the world hatith you, wite ye that it hadde me in hate rather than
U||   you [me priorem vobis odio habuit, Vulg.].—John xv. 18. Wiclif.
U||   The Sarazines maden another cytie more far from the see, and clepeden
U||   it the newe Damyete, so that now no man dwellethe at the rathere town
U||   of Damyete.—Sir John Mandeville, Voyage and Travaile, p. 46,
U||   Halliwell’s edition.
U||   Whatsoever thou or such other say, I say that the pilgrimage that now
U||   is used is to them that do it, a praisable and a good mean to come the
U||   rather to grace.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs; Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   The rather lambs been starved with cold.
U||   Spenser, The Shepherd’s Calendar, February.
U||   [Pg 230]
U||   Receipt. At this present the act of receiving, or acknowledgment of
U||   having received; but not seldom once the place for receiving, or
U||   receptacle.
U||   To conclude, his house was a common receipt for all those that came
U||   from Greece to Rome.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 446.
U||   Fountains I intend to be of two natures, the one that sprinkleth or
U||   spouteth water, the other a fair receipt of water, of some thirty or
U||   forty foot square, but without fish, or slime, or mud.—Bacon, Essays,
U||   46.
U||   Reclaim. A ‘reclamation’ is still sometimes a calling out against; but
U||   ‘to reclaim’ is never, I think, anything now but to call back again;
U||   never to disclaim.
U||   Herod, instead of reclaiming what they exclaimed [Acts xii. 22],
U||   embraced and hugged their praises as proper to himself, and thereupon
U||   an angel and worms, the best and basest of creatures, met in his
U||   punishment, the one smiting, the other eating him up.—Fuller, A Pisgah
U||   Sight of Palestine, b. ii. c. 8.
U||   Recognize. This verb means now to revive our knowledge of a person or
U||   thing; to reacquaint oneself with it; but in earlier usage to review,
U||   as in my first quotation, to reconnoitre, as in my second.
U||   In recognizing this history I have employed a little more labour,
U||   partly to enlarge the argument which I took in hand, partly also to
U||   assay, whether by any painstaking I might pacify the stomachs, or to
U||   satisfy the judgments of these importune quarrellers.—Foxe, Book of
U||   Martyrs; Epistle Dedicatory [of the Second Edition] to the Queen’s
U||   Majesty.
U||   In quartering either in village, field, or city, he [a commander] ought
U||   himself to recognize all avenues, whereby his enemies may come to
U||   him.—Monro, His Expedition, p. 9.
U||   [Pg 231]
U||   Reduce. That which is ‘reduced’ now is brought back to narrower limits,
U||   or lower terms, or more subject conditions, than those under which it
U||   subsisted before. But nothing of this lies of necessity in the word,
U||   nor yet in the earlier uses of it. According to these, that was
U||   ‘reduced’ which was brought back to its former estate, an estate that
U||   might be, and in all the following examples is, an ampler, larger, or
U||   more prosperous one than that which it superseded.
U||   The drift of the Roman armies and forces was not to bring free states
U||   into servitude, but contrariwise, to reduce those that were in bondage
U||   to liberty.—Holland, Livy, p. 1211.
U||   There remained only Britain [i.e. Britany] to be reunited, and so the
U||   monarchy of France to be reduced to the ancient terms and
U||   bounds.—Bacon, History of King Henry VII.
U||   That he might have these keys to open the heavenly Hades to reduced
U||   apostates, to penitent, believing, self-devoting sinners, for this it
U||   was necessary He should put on man, become obedient to death, even that

U||   Religion,  }
U||   Religious.
U||   Not, as too often now, used as equivalent for godliness; but like
U||   θρησκεία, for which it stands Jam. i. 27, it expressed the outer form
U||   and embodiment which the inward spirit of a true or a false devotion
U||   assumed. In the Middle Ages a ‘religion’ was a monastic Order, and they
U||   were ‘religious’ who had entered into one of these.
U||   We would admit and grant them, that images used for no religion, or
U||   superstition rather, we mean of none worshipped, nor in danger to be
U||   worshipped of any, may be suffered.—Homilies; Against Peril of
U||   Idolatry.

U||   Remark. There are no ‘remarks’ now but verbal ones. ‘To remark’ was
U||   once to point out, to designate.
U||   They [the publicans and harlots] are moved by shame, and punished by
U||   disgrace, and remarked by punishments, and frighted by the
U||   circumstances and notices of all the world, and separated from sober
U||   persons by laws and an intolerable character.—Bishop Taylor, Of

U||   Milton, Samson Agonistes, 1308.
U||   Remonstrate,  }
U||   Remonstrance.
U||   Its present sense, namely to expostulate, was only at a late date
U||   superinduced on the word. ‘To remonstrate’ is properly to make any show
U||   or representation in regard to some step that has been taken. It is now
U||   only such show or representation as protests against this step; and
U||   always assumes this step to have been distasteful; but this limitation
U||   lies not of necessity in the word.
U||   Properties of a faithful servant: a sedulous eye, to observe all
U||   occasions within or without, tending to remonstrate the habit
U||   within.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 309.

U||   It [the death of Lady Carbery] was not (in all appearance) of so much

U||   to all that stood in that sad attendance that this soul was dear to
U||   Him.—Bishop Taylor, Funeral Sermon on Lady Carbery.
U||   I consider that in two very great instances it was remonstrated that
U||   Christianity was the greatest persecution of natural justice and
U||   equality in the whole world.—Id., Life of Christ, Preface, § 32.
U||   When Sir Francis Cottington returned with our king’s oath, plighted to
U||   the annexed conditions for the ease of the Roman Catholics, the
U||   Spaniards made no remonstrance of joy, or of an ordinary liking of
U||   it.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part i. p. 145.
U||   No; the atheist is too wise in his generation to make remonstrances and
U||   declarations of what he thinks. It is his heart and the little council
U||   that is held there, that is only privy to his monstrous
U||   opinions.—South, Sermons, 1744, vol. ix. p. 78.
U||   Remorse,    }
U||   Remorseful.
U||   In ‘remorseless’ and in the phrase ‘without remorse,’ we retain a sense
U||   of ‘remorse’ as equivalent with pity, which otherwise has quite passed
U||   away from it. It may thus have acquired this meaning. There is nothing
U||   which is followed in natures not absolutely devilish with so swift
U||   revulsion of mind as acts of cruelty. Nowhere does the conscience so
U||   quickly sting the guilty actor as in and after these; and thus
U||   ‘remorse,’ which is the penitence of the natural man, the penitence not
U||   wrought by the spirit of grace, while it means the revulsion of the
U||   mind and conscience against any evil which has been done, came to mean
U||   predominantly revulsion against acts of cruelty, the pity which
U||   followed close on these; and thus pity in general, and not only as in
U||   this way called out.
U||   [Pg 235]
U||   King Richard by his own experience grew sensible of the miseries which
U||   merchants and mariners at sea underwent. Wherefore, now touched with

U||   Repeal. ‘To repeal’ (compare Old French ‘rapeler’) is to recall, and
U||   seldom or never applied now except to some statute or law, but formerly
U||   of far wider use.

U||   convertible with it.

U||   Or else conclude my words effectual.
U||   Shakespeare, 2 Henry VI., act iii. sc. 1.
U||   [Pg 236]
U||   Require. This has now something almost imperative in it; being less to
U||   request or to entreat than to command; but it was not so always.
U||   We do instantly require and desire the Blessed Virgin Mary with all the
U||   holy company of heaven, continually to pray for us.—Will of Henry VIII.
U||   Lord of his fortune he salutes thee, and
U||   Requires to live in Egypt.
U||   Shakespeare, Antony and Cleopatra, act iii. sc. 12.
U||   Resent,     }
U||   Resentment.
U||   When first introduced into the language (this was in the seventeenth
U||   century; ‘vox nova in nostrâ linguâ:’ Junius), ‘to resent’ meant to
U||   have a sense or feeling of that which had been done to us; but whether
U||   a sense of gratitude for the good, or of enmity for the evil, the word
U||   itself did not decide, and was employed in both meanings. It has fared
U||   not otherwise with ‘ressentiment’ in French. Of this Génin, La Langue
U||   de Molière, writes, ‘Ce mot, dont l’usage a déterminé l’acception en
U||   mauvaise part, ne signifiait jadis que sentiment avec plus de force.’
U||   Must we conclude from the fact that the latter is now the exclusive
U||   employment of it, that our sense of injuries is much stronger and more
U||   lasting than our sense of benefits?
U||   ’Tis by my touch alone that you resent
U||   What objects yield delight, what discontent.
U||   Beaumont, Psyche, can. iv. st. 156.
U||   Perchance as vultures are said to smell the earthliness of a dying
U||   corpse; so this bird of prey [the evil Spirit which personated Samuel]
U||   resented a worse than earthly savour in the soul of Saul, an evidence

U||   [Pg 237]
U||   The judicious prelate will prefer a drop of the sincere milk of the

U||   1.
U||   I resented as I ought the news of my mother-in-law’s death.—Sancroft,
U||   Variorum Shakespeare, vol. i. p. 518.
U||   Sadness does in some cases become a Christian, as being an index of a
U||   pious mind, of compassion, and a wise, proper resentment of
U||   things.—Bishop Taylor, Sermon 23, part ii.
U||   The Council taking notice of the many good services performed by Mr.
U||   John Milton, their Secretary for foreign languages, particularly for
U||   his book in vindication of the Parliament and people of England against
U||   the calumnies and invectives of Salmasius, have thought fit to declare
U||   their resentment and good acceptance of the same, and that the thanks
U||   of the Council be returned to Mr. Milton.—Extract from ‘The Council
U||   Book,’ 1651, June 18.
U||   Residence, }
U||   Resident.
U||   It will be seen from the quotations which follow that ‘residence’ in
U||   the seventeenth century meant something quite different from ordinary
U||   place of habitation, which is all the meaning which now it has.
U||   Separation in it is wrought by weight, as in the ordinary residence or
U||   settlement of liquors.—Bacon, Natural History, § 302.
U||   Of waters of a muddy residence we may make good use and quench our
U||   thirst, if we do not trouble them; yet upon any ungentle disturbance we
U||   drink down mud, instead of a clear stream.—Bishop Taylor, Sermon on the
U||   Gunpowder Treason.
U||   The inexperienced Christian shrieks out whenever his vessel shakes,
U||   thinking it always a danger that the watery pavement is not stable and
U||   resident like a rock.—Id., Sermon 11, part 3.
U||   Restive, [Pg 238] }
U||   Restiveness.
U||   Any one now invited to define a ‘restive’ horse would certainly put
U||   into his definition that it was one with too much motion; but in
U||   obedience to its etymology ‘restive’ would have once meant one with too
U||   little; determined to stand still when it ought to go forward. [It is
U||   the Old French restif, stubborn, drawing backward (see Cotgrave), from
U||   rester, Latin restare, to stand still.] Immobile, lazy, stubborn, are
U||   the three stages of meaning which the word went through, before it
U||   reached the fourth and present.
U||   Bishops or presbyters we know, and deacons we know, but what are
U||   chaplains? In state perhaps they may be listed among the upper
U||   serving-men of some great man’s household, the yeoman ushers of
U||   devotion, where the master is too resty or too rich to say his own
U||   prayers, or to bless his own table.—Milton, Iconoclastes, c. xxiv.
U||   Restive, or Resty, drawing back instead of going forward, as some
U||   horses do.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   Nothing hindereth men’s fortunes so much as this: Idem manebat, neque
U||   idem decebat; men are where they were, when occasions turn. From
U||   whatsoever root or cause this restiveness of mind proceedeth, it is a
U||   thing most prejudicial.—Bacon, Advancement of Learning, b. ii.
U||   The snake, by restiness and lying still all winter, hath a certain
U||   membrane or film growing over the whole body.—Holland, Pliny, part i.
U||   p. 210.
U||   Retaliate,   }
U||   Retaliation.
U||   It has fared with ‘retaliate’ and ‘retaliation’ as it has with ‘resent’
U||   and ‘resentment,’ that whereas men could once speak of the
U||   ‘retaliation’ of benefits as well as of wrongs, they only ‘retaliate’
U||   injuries now.
U||   Our captain would not salute the city, except they would
U||   retaliate.—Diary of Henry Teonge, Aug. 1, 1675.
U||   [Pg 239]
U||   [The king] expects a return in specie from them [the Dissenters], that
U||   the kindness which he has graciously shown them may be retaliated on
U||   those of his own persuasion.—Dryden, The Hind and the Panther, Preface.
U||   His majesty caused directions to be sent for the enlargement of the
U||   Roman priests, in retaliation for the prisoners that were set at
U||   liberty in Spain to congratulate the prince’s welcome.—Hacket, Life of
U||   Archbishop Williams, part i. p. 166.
U||   Revoke. This has now a much narrower range of meaning than the Latin
U||   ‘revocare;’ but some took for granted once that wherever the one word
U||   could have been used in Latin, the other might be used in English.
U||   The wolf, who would not be
U||   Revokëd from the slaughter for the sweetness of the blood,
U||   Persisted sharp and eager still, until that as he stood,
U||   Fast biting on a bullock’s neck, she turned him into stone.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. xi.
U||   Her knees revoked their first strength, and her feet
U||   Were borne above the ground with wings to greet
U||   The long-grieved queen with news her king was come.
U||   Chapman, The Odyssey of Homer, b. xxiii. l. 5.
U||   Rig. A somewhat vulgar word, with the present use of which, however, we
U||   are probably all familiar from its occurrence in John Gilpin:
U||   ‘He little guessed when he set out
U||   Of running such a rig.’
U||   But a ‘rig’ in its earlier use was not so often a strange uncomely
U||   feat, as a wanton uncomely person.
U||   Let none condemn them [the girls] for rigs because thus hoyting with
U||   the boys, seeing the simplicity of their age was a patent to privilege
U||   any innocent pastime.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. iv. 6.
U||   [Ripple.[Pg 240] It is now in literary English a poetical word, and
U||   nothing is ‘rippled’ but the surface of the water. This is probably a
U||   distinct word from the ‘ripple’ of the Whitby dialect, which means to
U||   scratch slightly as with a pin upon the skin (see Robinson’s
U||   ‘Glossary,’ English Dialect Society, 1876). This is precisely the
U||   meaning of ‘ripple’ in the citation from Holland below. For cognates of
U||   this ‘ripple’ to scratch see Skeat’s ‘Dictionary’ (s. v. ‘rip’).]
U||   On a sudden an horseman’s javelin, having slightly rippled the skin of
U||   his [Julian’s] left arm, pierced within his short ribs, and stuck fast
U||   in the nether lappet or fillet of his liver.—Holland, Ammianus, p. 264.
U||   Rogue. There was a time when ‘rogue’ meant no more than wandering
U||   mendicant. What of dishonesty is implied now in the word was afterwards
U||   superinduced upon it; as has also been the case with ‘tramp’ and
U||   ‘vagabond.’
U||   Mine enemy’s dog,
U||   Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
U||   Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
U||   To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
U||   In short and musty straw?
U||   Shakespeare, King Lear, act iv. sc. 7.
U||   Rogue signifieth with us an idle sturdy beggar, that, wandering from
U||   place to place without passport, after he hath been by justices
U||   bestowed upon some certain place of abode, or offered to be bestowed,
U||   is condemned to be so called; who for the first offence is called a
U||   rogue of the first degree, and punished by whipping, and boring through
U||   the gristle of the right ear with a hot iron an inch in compass, and
U||   for the second offence is called a rogue of the second degree, and put
U||   to death as a felon, if he be above eighteen years old.—Cowell, The
U||   Interpreter, s.v.
U||   [Pg 241]
U||   The third sort of those that live unprofitably and without a calling
U||   are our idle sturdy rogues and vagrant towns-end beggars. I mean such
U||   as are able to work, yet rather choose to wander abroad the country,
U||   and to spend their days in a most base and ungodly course of
U||   life.—Sanderson, Sermons, 1671, vol. i. p. 197.
U||   Romantic. It is much rarer to find words which in lapse of time have
U||   mended their position than those which have seen theirs grow worse. But
U||   such there are, and this is one of them. Who would have expected two
U||   centuries ago that ‘romantic’ would have held the place of honour which
U||   now it does; would have divided with ‘classical’ the whole world of
U||   modern literature?
U||   Can anything in nature be imagined more profane and impious, more
U||   absurd, and indeed romantic, than such a persuasion [namely that
U||   whenever in Scripture the Covenant is mentioned, the Scotch Covenant
U||   was intended]? and yet, as impious and absurd as it was, it bore down
U||   all before it, and overturned the equallest and best framed government
U||   in the world.—South, Sermons, 1737, vol. vi. p. 42.
U||   Room. In certain connexions we still employ ‘room’ for place, but in
U||   many more it obtains this meaning no longer. Thus one who accepts the
U||   words, ‘When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in
U||   the highest room’ (Luke xiv. 8), according to the present use of
U||   ‘room,’ will probably imagine to himself guests assembling in various
U||   apartments, some more honourable than other; and not, as indeed the
U||   meaning is, taking higher or lower places at one and the same table.
U||   In Clarence, Henry, and his son, young Edward,
U||   And all the unlooked-for issue of their bodies,
U||   To take their rooms, ere I can place myself?
U||   Shakespeare, 3 Henry VI., act iii. sc. 2.
U||   [Pg 242]
U||   If he have but twelve pence in’s purse, he will give it for the best
U||   room in a playhouse.—Sir T. Overbury, Characters: A Proud Man.
U||   Ruffian,   }
U||   Ruffianly.
U||   The Old French ‘ruffien,’ the Italian ‘ruffiano,’ the Spanish ‘rufian,’
U||   all signify the setter-forward of an infamous traffic between the
U||   sexes; nor will the passages quoted below leave any doubt that this is
U||   the proper meaning of ‘ruffian’ in English, others being secondary and
U||   derived from it. At the same time the ‘ruffian’ is not merely the
U||   ‘leno,’ he is the ‘amasius’ as well. For some instructive English uses
U||   of the word, see Ascham’s Scholemaster, Wright’s edit. pp. 44, 215.
U||   Let young men consider the precious value of their time, and waste it
U||   not in idleness, in jollity, in gaming, in banqueting, in ruffians’
U||   company.—Homilies; Against Idleness.
U||   Xenocrates, casting but his eye upon Polemon, who was come into his
U||   school like a ruffian, by his very look only redeemed him from his
U||   loose life.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 112.
U||   He [her husband] is no sooner abroad than she is instantly at home,
U||   revelling with her ruffians.—Reynolds, God’s Revenge against Murther,
U||   b. iii. hist. 11.
U||   Who in London hath not heard of his [Greene’s] dissolute and licentious
U||   living; his fond disguising of a Master of Art with ruffianly hair,
U||   unseemly apparel, and more unseemly company?—G. Harvey, Four Letters
U||   touching Robert Greene, p. 7.
U||   Some frenchified or outlandish monsieur, who hath nothing else to make
U||   him famous, I should say infamous, but an effeminate, ruffianly, ugly,
U||   and deformed lock.—Prynne, The Unloveliness of Love-locks, p. 27.
U||   Rummage. At present so to look for one thing as in the looking to
U||   overturn and unsettle a great[Pg 243] many others. It is a sea-term,
U||   and signified at first to dispose with such orderly method goods in the
U||   hold of a ship that there should be the greatest possible room, or
U||   ‘roomage.’ The quotation from Phillips shows the word in the act of
U||   transition from its former use to its present.
U||   And that the masters of the ships do look well to the romaging, for
U||   they might bring away a great deal more than they do, if they would
U||   take pain in the romaging.—Hakluyt, Voyages, vol. i. p. 308.
U||   To rummage (sea-term): To remove any goods or luggage from one place to
U||   another, especially to clear the ship’s hold of any goods or lading, in
U||   order to their being handsomely stowed and placed; whence the word is
U||   used upon other occasions, for to rake into, or to search
U||   narrowly.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   Sad,     }
U||   Sadly,
U||   Sadness.
U||   This had once the meaning of earnest, serious, sedate. The passage from
U||   Shakespeare quoted below marks ‘sadly’ and ‘sadness’ in their
U||   transitional state from the old meaning to the new; Benvolio using
U||   ‘sadness’ in the old sense, Romeo pretending to understand him in the
U||   new. For the etymology of ‘sad’ see Mayhew-Skeat, Dict. of Middle
U||   English.
U||   O dere wif, o gemme of lustyhede,
U||   That were to me so sade, and eke so trewe.
U||   Chaucer, The Manciples Tale.
U||   He may have one year, or two at the most, an ancient and sad matron
U||   attending on him.—Sir T. Elyot, The Governor, b. i. c. 6.
U||   For when I thinke how farre this earth doth us divyde,
U||   Alas, mesemes, love throws me down, I fele how that I slide.

U||   Ben. Groan? why, no;
U||   But sadly tell me who?
U||   Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, act i. sc. 1.
U||   Sampler. This has now quite dissociated itself in meaning from
U||   ‘exemplar,’ of which it is the popular form, as ‘sample’ has done from
U||   ‘example;’ not so, however, once.
U||   Job, the sawmpler of pacience.—Preparatory Epistles of St. Jerome to
U||   Wiclif’s Bible.
U||   Sash. At present always a belt or girdle of the loins; not so, however,
U||   when first introduced from the East. By the ‘sash,’ or ‘shash’ as it
U||   was then always spelt, was understood the roll of silk, fine linen, or
U||   gauze, worn about the head; in fact a turban. The word is of Persian
U||   origin.
U||   Shash: Cidaris seu tiara, pileus Turcicus, ut doct. Th. H. placet, ab
U||   It. Sessa, gausapina cujus involucris Turcæ pileos suos
U||   adornant.—Skinner, Etymologicon.
U||   So much for the silk in Judea, called Shesh in Hebrew, whence haply
U||   that fine linen or silk is called shashes, worn at this day about the
U||   heads of eastern people.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b. ii. c.
U||   14.
U||   He [a Persian merchant] was apparelled in a long robe of cloth of gold,
U||   his head was wreathed with a huge shash or tulipant of silk and
U||   gold.—Herbert, Travels, 1638, p. 191.
U||   Scarce, [Pg 245] }
U||   Scarcely,
U||   Scarcity.
U||   Now expressing the fact that the thing to which this epithet is applied
U||   is rare, not easily to be come by; but in the time of Chaucer, Wiclif,
U||   and Gower, and till a later day, parsimonious or stingy. For the
U||   derivation see Skeat’s Dictionary.
U||   Ye schul use the richesses the whiche ye han geten by youre witte and
U||   by youre travaile, in such a maner, that men holde yow not skarse ne to

U||   Secure,   }
U||   Securely,
U||   Security.
U||   In our present English the difference between ‘safe’ and ‘secure’ is
U||   hardly recognized, but once it was otherwise. ‘Secure’ (‘securus,’ from
U||   sē- + cura) was subjective; it was a man’s own sense, well grounded or
U||   not, of the absence of danger; ‘safe’ was objective, the actual fact of
U||   such absence of danger. A man, therefore, might not be ‘safe,’ just
U||   because he was ‘secure’ (thus see Judges xviii. 7, 10, 27, and Paradise
U||   Lost, iv. 791). I may observe that our use of ‘secure’ at Matt. xxviii.
U||   14, is in fact this early, though we may easily read the passage as
U||   though it were employed in the modern sense. ‘We will secure you’ of
U||   our Version represents ἀμερίμνους ὑμᾶς ποιήσομεν of the original.
U||   [Pg 246]
U||   My wanton weakness did herself betray
U||   With too much play.
U||   I was too bold; he never yet stood safe
U||   That stands secure.
U||   Quarles, Emblems, ii. 14.
U||   We cannot endure to be disturbed or awakened from our pleasing
U||   lethargy. For we care not to be safe, but to be secure.—Bishop Taylor,
U||   Of Slander and Flattery.
U||   Man may securely sin, but safely never.
U||   Ben Jonson, The Forest, xi.
U||   We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
U||   But yet we strike not, but securely perish.
U||   Shakespeare, Richard II., act ii. sc. 1.

U||   Security some men call the suburbs of hell,
U||   Only a dead wall between.
U||   Webster, Duchess of Malfi, act v. sc. 2.
U||   Sedition,  }
U||   Seditious.
U||   There was an attempt on the part of some scholarly writers at the
U||   beginning of the seventeenth century to keep ‘sedition’ true to its
U||   etymology, and to the meaning which ‘seditio’ bears in the Latin. This
U||   is the explanation of its employment as a rendering of διχοστασίαι,
U||   Gal. v. 21, as quoted below; which in our present English would be more
U||   accurately rendered, secessions, dissensions, or divisions; in exactly
U||   which sense ‘seditious’ is there used by our Translators. So too,[Pg
U||   247] when Satan, in the quotation given below, addresses Abdiel
U||   ‘seditious Angel,’ this is to find the same explanation, as is clear
U||   from the words which immediately follow. He the one faithful, taking
U||   the Lord’s side, had in so doing divided the ranks of those who adhered
U||   to the fallen Archangel, and separated from them, being therein
U||   ‘seditious.’ The quotation from Bishop Andrewes not less evidently
U||   shows how distinct in his mind ‘seditions’ were from those overt acts
U||   of petty treason which we now call by this name; however, they might
U||   often lead to such.
U||   Whom you find thus magnifying of changes and projecting new plots for
U||   the people, be sure they are in the way to sedition. For (mark it) they
U||   do sedire, that is seorsim ire, go aside; they have their meetings
U||   apart about their new alterations. Now of sedire comes sedition,
U||   side-going. For if that be not looked to in time, the next news is, the
U||   blowing of a trumpet, and Sheba’s proclamation, We have no part in
U||   David. It begins in Shimei, it ends in Sheba.—Andrewes, Of the
U||   Gunpowder Treason, Serm. 6.
U||   Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, ... seditions
U||   (in R.V. ‘divisions’).—Gal. v. 20, 21. (A.V.)
U||   Ill for thee, but in wished hour
U||   Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest
U||   From flight, seditious Angel, to receive
U||   Thy merited reward.
U||   Milton, Paradise Lost, vi. 150.
U||   See. Not always confined as now to the seat or residence of a bishop;
U||   nor indeed did it necessarily involve the notion of a seat of authority
U||   at all.

U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, iv. 10, 30.
U||   Seedsman. Between the ‘seedsman’ and the ‘sower’ there is now a useful
U||   distinction. The one sells the seed; the other scatters it in the
U||   furrow; but the distinction is comparatively modern.
U||   The higher Nilus swells
U||   The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
U||   Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
U||   And shortly comes to harvest.
U||   Shakespeare, Antony and Cleopatra, act ii. sc. 7.
U||   Sensual,    }
U||   Sensuality.
U||   ‘Sensual’ is employed now only in an ill meaning, and implies ever a
U||   predominance of sense in quarters where it ought not so to predominate.
U||   Milton, feeling that we wanted another word affirming this predominance
U||   where no such fault was implied by it, and that ‘sensual’ only
U||   imperfectly expressed this, employed, I know not whether he coined,
U||   ‘sensuous,’ a word which, if it had rooted itself in the language at
U||   once, might have proved of excellent service. ‘Sensuality’ has had
U||   always an ill meaning, but not always the same ill meaning which it has
U||   now. Any walking by sense and sight rather than by faith was
U||   ‘sensuality’ of old.
U||   Hath not the Lord Jesus convinced thy sensual heart by sensual
U||   arguments? If thy sense were not left-handed, thou[Pg 249] mightest
U||   with thy right hand bear down thine infidelity; for God hath given
U||   assurance sufficient by his Son to thy very sense, if though wert not
U||   brutish (1 John i. 1).—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 493.
U||   There cannot always be that degree of sensual, pungent, or delectable
U||   affections towards religion as towards the desires of nature and
U||   sense.—Bishop Taylor, Life of Christ, part ii. § 12.
U||   Far as creation’s ample range extends,
U||   The scale of sensual, mental powers ascends.
U||   Pope, Essay on Man, b. i.
U||   I do take him to be a hardy captain; but yet a man more meet to be
U||   governed than to govern; for all his enterprizes be made upon his own
U||   sensuality, without the advice and counsel of those that been put in
U||   trust by the King’s Majesty.—State Papers, 1538, vol. iii. p. 95.
U||   He who might claim this absolute power over the soul to be believed
U||   upon his bare word, yet seeing the sensuality of man and our woful
U||   distrust, is willing to allow us all the means of strengthening our
U||   souls in his promise, by such seals and witnesses as confirm
U||   it.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 483.
U||   A great number of people in divers parts of this realm, following their
U||   own sensuality, and living without knowledge and due fear of God, do
U||   wilfully and schismatically abstain and refuse to come to their own
U||   parish churches.—Act of Uniformity, 1662.
U||   Servant. A wooer, follower, admirer, lover, not of necessity an
U||   accepted one, was a ‘servant’ in the chivalrous language of two or
U||   three centuries ago.
U||   Valentine. Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.

U||   much that he makes any court to me.—Letters from Dorothy Osborne, Lett.

U||   [Pg 250]
U||   Servility. The subjective abjectness and baseness of spirit of one who
U||   is a slave, or who acts as one, is always implied by this word at the
U||   present; while once it did but express the objective fact of an
U||   outwardly servile condition in him of whom it was predicated, leaving
U||   it possible that in spirit he might be free notwithstanding.
U||   Such servility as the Jews endured under the Greeks and Asiatics, have
U||   they endured under the Saracen and the Turk.—Jackson, The Eternal Truth
U||   of Scriptures, b. i. c. 26.
U||   We are no longer under the servility of the law of Moses, but are all
U||   the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.—H. More, The Grand
U||   Mystery of Godliness, b. viii. c. 6.
U||   The same [faith] inclined Moses to exchange the dignities and delights
U||   of a court for a state of vagrancy and servility.—Barrow, Sermon 3, On
U||   the Apostles’ Creed.
U||   [Shed. This verb was once in common use in the sense of to separate,
U||   divide, or part. This ‘shed’ is the representative of the O.E.
U||   ‘sceādan’ (scādan), the equivalent of the modern German ‘scheiden.’
U||   With these words is connected the modern geographical term ‘watershed,’
U||   i.e. water-divider. ‘To shed’ is still used in the North in the sense
U||   of to divide or separate (Halliwell). From this verb comes the word
U||   ‘sheeding,’ the name of a territorial division in the Isle of Man.
U||   Probably our modern ‘shed,’ to scatter, pour, may be the same word as
U||   ‘shed,’ to separate, with a development of meaning, but the relation of
U||   the two words has not been satisfactorily made out yet.]
U||   They say also that the manner of making the shed [διακρίνεσθαι] of
U||   new-wedded wives’ hair with the iron head of a[Pg 251] javelin came up
U||   then likewise.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 22.
U||   They were never so careful to comb their heads as when they should to
U||   the battle; for then they did noint their selves with sweet oils, and
U||   did shed their hair.—Id., ibid. p. 45.
U||   Sheer. It is curious that Christopher Sly’s declaration that he was
U||   ‘fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale’ (Taming of the Shrew,
U||   Induction, sc. 2) should have given so much trouble to some of the
U||   early commentators upon Shakespeare. ‘Sheer,’ which is pure, unmixed,
U||   was used of things concrete once, although mostly of things abstract
U||   now.
U||   They had scarcely sunk through the uppermost course of sand above, when
U||   they might see small sources to boil up, at the first troubled, but
U||   afterward they began to yield sheer and clear water in great
U||   abundance.—Holland, Livy, p. 1911.
U||   Thou sheer, immaculate, and silver fountain,
U||   From whence this stream through muddy passages
U||   Hath held his current.
U||   Shakespeare, King Richard II., act v. sc. 3.
U||   Thou never hadst in thy house, to stay men’s stomachs,
U||   A piece of Suffolk cheese, or gammon of bacon,
U||   Or any esculent, but sheer drink only,
U||   For which gross fault I here do damn thy license.
U||   Massinger, A New Way to pay Old Debts, act iv. sc. 2.
U||   Shelf. ‘To shelve’ as to shoal, still remains; but not so, except in
U||   mariners’ charts, ‘shelf’ as = shallow or sandbank. This ‘shelf’ is
U||   quite a distinct word from the ‘shelf’ (of a cupboard).
U||   I thought fit to follow the rule of coasting maps, where the shelves
U||   and rocks are described as well as the safe channel.—Davenant, Preface
U||   to Gondibert.
U||   God wisheth none should wreck on a strange shelf;
U||   To Him man’s dearer than t’ himself.
U||   Ben Jonson, The Forest, iii.

U||   The tossing vessel sailed on shoaly ground.
U||   Sure of his pilot’s loss, he takes himself
U||   The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.
U||   Dryden, Virgil’s Æneid, b. v.
U||   Shrew. There are at the present no ‘shrews’ save female ones; but the
U||   word, like so many others which we have met with, now restrained to one
U||   sex, was formerly applied to both. It conveyed also of old a much
U||   deeper moral reprobation than now or in the Middle English it did. Thus
U||   Lucifer is a ‘shrew’ in Piers Plowman, and two murderers are ‘shrews’
U||   in the quotation from Chaucer which follows.
U||   And thus accorded ben these schrewes twayn
U||   To sle the thridde, as ye han herd me sayn.

U||   The weakness of the world’s moral indignation against evil causes a

U||   An ant is a wise creature for itself; but it is a shrewd thing in an
U||   orchard or garden.—Bacon, Essay 23.

U||   Siege. A ‘siege’ is now the sitting down of an army before a fortified
U||   place with the purpose of taking it; and has no other meaning but this.
U||   It had once the double meaning, abstract and concrete, of the French
U||   ‘siège,’ a seat.
U||   Whanne mannus sone schal come in his majeste and alle hise aungels with
U||   hym, thanne he schal sitte on the sege of his majeste, and alle folkis

U||   Silliness.
U||   A deep conviction of men that he who departs from evil will make
U||   himself a prey, that none will be a match for the world’s evil who is
U||   not himself evil, has brought to pass the fact that a number of words,
U||   signifying at first goodness, signify next well-meaning simplicity; the
U||   notions of goodness and foolishness, with a strong predominance of the
U||   last, for a while interpenetrating one another in them; till at length
U||   the latter quite expels the former, and remains as the sole possessor
U||   of the word. I need hardly mention the Greek ἄκακος, εὐήθης, εὐήθεια:
U||   while the same has happened in regard of the O.E. ‘sǽlig,’ which (the
U||   same word as the German ‘selig’) has successively meant, (1) blissful,
U||   (2) innocent, harmless, (3) weakly foolish.
U||   Oh God, quod she, so worldly selynesse,

U||   Sincere,   }
U||   Sincerity.
U||   The etymology of ‘sincerus’ being uncertain, it is impossible to say
U||   what is the primary notion of our English ‘sincere.’ These words belong
U||   now to an ethical sphere exclusively, and even there their meaning is
U||   not altogether what once it was; but the absence of foreign admixture
U||   which they predicate might be literal once.
U||   [Pg 255]
U||   The mind of a man, as it is not of that content or receipt to
U||   comprehend knowledge without helps and supplies, so again, it is not
U||   sincere, but of an ill and corrupt tincture.—Bacon, Of the

U||   The Germans are a people that more than all the world, I think, may
U||   boast sincerity, as being for some thousands of years a pure and

U||   Skeleton. Now the framework of bones as entirely denuded of the flesh;

U||   certain obscure Words.
U||   Smug. One of many words which have been spoilt for poetic use through
U||   being drawn into our serio-comic vocabulary. It still means neat, trim,
U||   being connected with the German ‘schmuck,’ trim, spruce; but seeks to
U||   present the very neatness which it implies in a ridiculous ignoble
U||   point of view. Any such intention was very far from it once.
U||   And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
U||   In a new channel, fair and evenly.

U||   [Pg 256]
U||   Snail. It is curious what different objects men will be content for
U||   long to confuse under a common name. Thus in some provincial dialects
U||   of Germany they have only one name, ‘padde’ (compare our ‘paddock’),
U||   for frog and toad. So too ‘snail’ (cochlea) and ‘slug’ (limax) with us
U||   were both to a comparatively recent period included under the former
U||   name. ‘Slug’ indeed, in the sense of slothful, is an old word in the
U||   language; but only at the end of the seventeenth or beginning of the
U||   eighteenth century was it transferred to that familiar pest of our
U||   gardens which we now call by this name. Indeed up to the present day in
U||   many of our provincial dialects slugs and snails are invariably both
U||   included under the latter name; the snail proper being sometimes
U||   distinguished from the other as the ‘shell-snail’ (see Holland’s
U||   Plutarch, p. 212). See an interesting discussion in the Philological
U||   Society’s Transactions, 1860-1, pp. 102-106.
U||   There is much variety even in creatures of the same kind. See these two
U||   snails. One hath a house, the other wants it; yet both are snails, and
U||   it is a question whether case is the better. That which hath a house
U||   hath more shelter, that which wants it hath more freedom.—Bishop Hall,
U||   Occasional Meditations.
U||   Snails, a soft and exosseous animal, whereof in the naked and greater

U||   disadvantage, if not utter undoing.—Sanderson, Sermons, 1671, vol. ii.
U||   p. 241.
U||   Soft,     }
U||   Softness.
U||   It is not an honourable fact that ‘soft’ and ‘softness’ should now be
U||   terms of slight, almost of contempt, when ethically employed; although
U||   indeed it is only a repetition of what we find in χρηστός, εὐήθης,
U||   ‘gutig,’ ‘bonhomie,’ and other words not a few.
U||   That they speak evil of no man, that they be no fighters, but soft
U||   [ἐπιεικεῖς], showing all meekness unto all men.—Titus iii. 2. Tyndale.

U||   Let your softness [τὸ ἐπιεικὲς ὑμῶν] be known unto all men.—Phil. iv.
U||   5. Cranmer.
U||   Sonnet. A ‘sonnet’ now must consist of exactly fourteen lines, neither
U||   more nor less; and these with a fixed arrangement, though admitting a
U||   certain relaxation, of the rhymes; but ‘sonnet’ used often to be
U||   applied to any shorter poem, especially of an amatory kind.
U||   He [Arion] had a wonderful desire to chaunt a sonnet or hymn unto
U||   Apollo Pythius.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 343.
U||   If ye will tell us a tale, or play a jig, or show us a play and fine

U||   innocence.—South, Sermons, vol. ii. p. 427.

U||   [Sparkle. It is probable that ‘to sparkle’ in the sense of to scatter
U||   is not the same word as our modern ‘sparkle,’ the diminutive of
U||   ‘spark,’ a small particle of fire. I think that it is almost certain
U||   that the ‘sparkle’ in the passages given below is a later form of
U||   ‘sparple,’ to scatter, see Trevisa, v. 287 (Rolls Series), and
U||   Promptorium. The Middle English ‘sparplen’ is the same word as the
U||   French ‘esparpiller,’ to scatter, disparkle asunder (see Cotgrave);
U||   compare also Italian ‘sparpagliare’ (Florio).[Pg 259] For the etymology
U||   of ‘sparple’ see Mayhew-Skeat, Dict. of Middle English (s. v.

U||   And awhile chawing all those things in his mouth, he spitteth it upon
U||   him whom he desireth to kill; who being sparkled therewith, dieth by
U||   force of the poison within the space of half an hour.—Purchas’s
U||   Pilgrims, part ii. p. 1495.
U||   Specious. Like the Latin ‘speciosus,’ it simply signified beautiful
U||   once; it now means always presenting a deceitful appearance of that
U||   beauty which is not really possessed, and is never used in any but an
U||   ethical sense.
U||   This prince hadde a dowter dere, Asneth was her name,
U||   A virgine ful specious, and semely of stature.
U||   Metrical Romance of the Fourteenth Century.
U||   And they knew him, that it was he which sate for alms at the Specious
U||   Gate of the temple.—Acts iii. 10. Rheims.
U||   His mind as pure and neatly kept
U||   As were his nurseries, and swept
U||   So of uncleanness or offence
U||   That never came ill odour thence;
U||   And add his actions unto these,
U||   They were as specious as his trees.
U||   Ben Jonson, Epitaph on Master Vincent Corbet.
U||   Which [almug-trees], if odoriferous, made that passage as sweet to the
U||   smell as specious to the sight.—Fuller, Α Pisgah Sight of Palestine, b.
U||   iii. c. 2, § 5.
U||   Spice. We have in English a double adoption of the Latin ‘species,’
U||   namely ‘spice’ and ‘species’.[Pg 260] ‘Spice,’ the earlier form (Old
U||   French ‘espice’), is now limited to certain aromatic drugs, which, as
U||   consisting of various kinds, have this name of ‘spices.’ But ‘spice’
U||   was once employed as ‘species’ is now.
U||   Absteyne you fro al yvel spice [ab omni specie malâ, Vulg.]—1 Thess. v.
U||   22. Wiclif.
U||   The spices of envye ben these.—Chaucer, The Persones Tale (Morris, p.
U||   304).
U||   Justice, although it be but one entire virtue, yet is described in two
U||   kinds of spices. The one is named justice distributive, the other is
U||   called commutative.—Sir T. Elyot, The Governor, b. iii. c. 1.
U||   Spill. Nothing appears so utterly and irrecoverably lost as liquid
U||   poured upon the ground; and thus it has come to pass that ‘to spill,’
U||   the Ο. E. ‘spillan,’ which had once the meaning of to waste, to
U||   squander, to consume, to destroy, and that in any way, is now
U||   restricted to this single meaning.
U||   O litel child, alas! what is thi gilt,
U||   That never wroughtest synne as yet, parde?
U||   Why wil thyn harde fader han the spilt?
U||   Chaucer, The Man of Lawes Tale.
U||   If the colors ... be not well tempered or not well laid, or be used in
U||   excess, or never so little disordered and misplaced, they disfigure the
U||   stuff, and spill the whole workmanship, taking away all beauty and good
U||   liking from it.—Puttenham, Art of English Poesy, b. iii. c. 1.
U||   Spill not the morning, the quintessence of the day, in
U||   recreations.—Fuller, Holy State, b. iii. c. 13.
U||   Spinster. A name that was often applied to women of evil life, in that
U||   they were set to enforced labour of spinning in the Spittle or House of
U||   Correction (it is still called ‘The Spinning House’ at[Pg 261]
U||   Cambridge), and thus were ‘spinsters.’ None of our Dictionaries, so far
U||   as I have observed, take note of this use of the word.
U||   Many would never be indicted spinsters, were they spinsters indeed, nor
U||   come to so public and shameful punishments, if painfully employed in
U||   that vocation.—Fuller, Worthies of England: Kent.
U||   Geta. These women are still troublesome;
U||   There be houses provided for such wretched women,
U||   And some small rents to set ye a spinning.
U||   Drusilla. Sir,
U||   We are no spinsters, nor, if you look upon us,
U||   So wretched as you take us.
U||   Beaumont and Fletcher, The Prophetess, act iii. sc. 1.
U||   Spruce. The exploits of the Teutonic Knights against the Pruzzi, the
U||   stubborn heathen of Lithuania, made Prussia to be very familiar on the
U||   lips of men in the later Middle Ages (see Weigand, s. v. Preuszen).
U||   This Prussia, Sprutia very often in medieval Latin, appears now as
U||   ‘Pruce’ (so in Chaucer), and now as ‘Spruce’ (see Skeat’s Dictionary);
U||   and in this latter form it survives in our spruce fir, which was
U||   brought from Northern Europe, in spruce beer, and in spruce, more
U||   vaguely applied to a certain neatness and smartness of outward
U||   appearance; one which it is implied had reached us from those quarters.
U||   They were apparelled after the fashion of Prussia or Spruce.—Hall,
U||   Chronicle, Henry VIII.
U||   Norway in that age, the sprucest of the three kingdoms of Scandia, and
U||   best tricked up with shipping, sent her fleet of tall soldiers to
U||   Syria.—Fuller, Holy War, b. v. c. 22.
U||   Squander. The examples which follow will show that ‘to squander’ had
U||   once, if not a different, yet a[Pg 262] much wider use than it now, at
U||   least in our classical English, retains. In the northern dialects it is
U||   still used as equivalent to ‘disperse.’
U||   He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; ... he hath
U||   a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath,
U||   squandered abroad.—Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice, act i. sc. 3.
U||   The minister is not to come into the pulpit, as a fencer upon the
U||   stage, to make a fair flourish against sin, but rather as a captain
U||   into the field, to bend his forces specially against the strongest
U||   troops of the enemy, and to squander and break through the thickest
U||   ranks.—Sanderson, Sermon 2, ad Clerum.
U||   They charge, recharge, and all along the sea
U||   They chase and squander the huge Belgian fleet.
U||   Dryden, Annus Mirabilis, st. 67.
U||   Staple. A curious change has come over this word. We should now say,
U||   Cotton is the great ‘staple,’ that is, the established merchandize, of
U||   Manchester; our ancestors would have reversed this and said, Manchester
U||   is the great ‘staple,’ or established mart, of cotton. We make the
U||   goods prepared or sold the ‘staple’ of the place; they made the place
U||   the ‘staple’ of the goods. See Cowell, The Interpreter, s. v.
U||   Men in all ages have made themselves merry with singling out some
U||   place, and fixing the staple of stupidity and stolidity
U||   therein.—Fuller, Worthies of England: Nottinghamshire.
U||   Staple; a city or town, where merchants jointly lay up their
U||   commodities for the better uttering of them by the great; a public
U||   storehouse.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   Starve. This word, the O.E. ‘steorfan,’ the German ‘sterben,’ to die,
U||   is only by comparatively[Pg 263] modern use restricted to dying by cold
U||   or by hunger; in this restriction of use, resembling the French
U||   ‘noyer,’ to kill by drowning, while ‘necare,’ from which it descends,
U||   is to kill by any manner of death. But innumerable words are thus like
U||   rivers, which once pouring their waters through many channels, have now
U||   left dry and abandoned them all, save one, or, as in the present
U||   instance it happens, save two.
U||   For wele or woo sche wol him not forsake:
U||   Sche is not wery him to love and serve,
U||   Theigh that he lay bedred til that he sterve.
U||   Chaucer, The Marchaundes Tale.
U||   But, if for me ye fight, or me will serve,
U||   Not this rude kind of battell, nor these armes
U||   Are meet, the which doe men in bale to sterve.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, ii. 6, 34.
U||   State. Used often by our old writers for a raised dais or platform, on
U||   which was placed a chair or throne with a canopy (the German
U||   ‘Thronhimmel’) above it; being the chiefest seat of honour; thus in
U||   Massinger’s Bondman, act i. sc. 3, according to the old stage-direction
U||   Archidamus ‘offers Timoleon the state.’ But there is another use of
U||   ‘state’ not unfrequent in the seventeenth century, though altogether
U||   unknown in our own. A ‘state’ was a republic, as contradistinguished
U||   from a monarchy. This usage, which the States of Holland may have
U||   contributed to bring about, does not seem to have lasted very long.
U||   But for a canopy to shade her head,
U||   No state which lasts no longer than ’tis stayed,
U||   And fastened up by cords and pillars’ aid.
U||   Beaumont, Psyche, can. xix. st. 170.
U||   [Pg 264]
U||   Their majesties were seated as is aforesaid under their canopies or
U||   states, whereof that of the Queen was somewhat lesser and lower than
U||   that of the King, but both of them exceeding rich.—History of the
U||   Coronation of King James II., 1687, p. 61.
U||   When he went to court, he used to kick away the state, and sit down by
U||   his prince cheek by jowl. Confound these states, says he, they are a
U||   modern invention.—Swift, History of John Bull, part ii. c. 1.
U||   What say some others? A government of states would do much better for
U||   you than a monarchy.—Andrewes, Sermon 6, Of the Gunpowder Treason.
U||   Dull subjects see too late
U||   Their safety in monarchal reign;
U||   Finding their freedom in a state
U||   Is but proud strutting in a chain.
U||   Davenant, The Dream.
U||   Those very Jews, who, at their very best
U||   Their humour more than loyalty expressed,
U||   Thought they might ruin him, they could create;
U||   Or melt him to a golden calf, a state.
U||   Dryden, Absalom and Achitophel, 66.
U||   Stationer. There was a time when ‘stationer,’ meaning properly no more
U||   than one who had his station, that is, in the market-place or
U||   elsewhere, included the bookseller and the publisher, as well as the
U||   dealer in the raw material of books. But when, in the division of
U||   labour, these became separate businesses, the name was restrained to
U||   him who dealt in the latter articles alone.
U||   Stacyonere, or he that sellythe bokys, stacionarius,
U||   bibliopola.—Promptorium.
U||   I doubt not but that the Animadverter’s stationer doth hope and desire
U||   that he hath thus pleased people in his book, for the advancing of the
U||   price and quickening the sale thereof.—Fuller, Appeal of Injured
U||   Innocence, p. 38.
U||   [Pg 265]
U||   The right of the printed copies (which the stationer takes as his own
U||   freehold), was dispersed in five or six several hands.—Oley, Preface to
U||   Dr. Jackson’s Works.
U||   Quarles, Chapman, Heywood, Wither had applause,
U||   And Wild, and Ogilby in former days;
U||   But now are damned to wrapping drugs and wares,
U||   And cursed by all their broken stationers.
U||   Oldham, A Satire.
U||   Stickle,  }
U||   Stickler.
U||   Now to stand with a certain pertinacity to one’s point, refusing to
U||   renounce or go back from it; but formerly to interpose between
U||   combatants and separate them, when they had sufficiently satisfied the
U||   laws of honour. Our present meaning of the word connects itself with
U||   the past in the fact that the ‘sticklers,’ or seconds, as we should
U||   call them now, often fulfilled another function, being ready to
U||   maintain in their own persons and by their own arms the quarrel of
U||   their principals, and thus to ‘stickle’ for it. [The word ‘stickle’
U||   represents the Middle English ‘stightlen,’ to order, arrange; for an
U||   interesting account of its cognates see Skeat’s Dictionary.]
U||   I styckyll betwene wrastellers, or any folkes that prove mastries to se
U||   that none do other wronge, or I parte folkes that be redy to
U||   fyght.—Palsgrave.
U||   Betwixt which three a question grew,
U||   Which should the worthiest be;
U||   Which violently they pursue,
U||   And would not stickled be.
U||   Drayton, Muses’ Elysium, Nymph. 6.
U||   The same angel [in Tasso], when half of the Christians are already
U||   killed, and all the rest are in a fair way of being routed, stickles
U||   betwixt the remainders of God’s hosts and the race of fiends; pulls the
U||   devils backwards by the tails, and drives them from their
U||   quarry.—Dryden, Dedication of Translations from Juvenal, p. 122.
U||   [Pg 266]
U||   In ancient times they were wont to employ third persons as sticklers,
U||   to see no treachery nor disorder were used, and to bear witness of the
U||   combat’s success.—Florio, Montaigne, ii. 27.
U||   The dragon wing of night o’erspreads the earth,
U||   And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
U||   Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, act v. sc. 9.
U||   Our former chiefs, like sticklers of the war,
U||   First fought to inflame the parties, then to poise;
U||   The quarrel loved, but did the cause abhor,
U||   And did not strike to hurt, but make a noise.
U||   Dryden, On the Death of Oliver Cromwell.
U||   Stomach. Already in classical Latin ‘stomachus’ had all the uses,
U||   courage, pride, indignation, ill-will, which ‘stomach’ may be seen in
U||   the following quotations to have once possessed, but which at this day
U||   have nearly or quite departed from it.
U||   And sence we herde therof oure hert hath failed us, neither is there a
U||   good stomache more in eny man, by the reasone of youre commynge.—Josh.
U||   ii. 11. Coverdale.
U||   He was a man
U||   Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
U||   Himself with princes.
U||   Shakespeare, Henry VIII., act iv. sc. 2.
U||   Arius, discontented that one should be placed before him in honour,
U||   whose superior he thought himself in desert, became through envy and
U||   stomach prone unto contradiction, and bold to broach that heresy
U||   wherein the Deity of our Lord Jesus Christ was denied.—Hooker,
U||   Ecclesiastical Polity, b. v. § 42.
U||   [Stout. This word is now generally used in the sense of corpulent, less
U||   frequently in the sense of strong, robust. In provincial use ‘stout’
U||   has sometimes the meaning of proud, and this is probably the[Pg 267]
U||   original meaning of the word. ‘Stout’ is the same word as the Old
U||   French estout, bold, proud, which represents a Germanic base stolto-;
U||   compare modern German stolz, proud (see Kluge, s. v.). In the passages
U||   below the word retains its old meaning.]
U||   Commonly it is seen that they that be rich are lofty and
U||   stout.—Latimer, Sermons, p. 545.
U||   I stout and you stout,
U||   Who will carry the dirt out?
U||   Old Proverb.
U||   Come all to ruin; let
U||   Thy mother rather feel thy pride, than fear
U||   Thy dangerous stoutness; for I mock at death
U||   With as big heart as thou.
U||   Shakespeare, Coriolanus, act iii. sc. 2.
U||   Stove. This word, which was probably introduced from Holland, has much
U||   narrowed its meaning. Bath, hothouse, any room where air or water was
U||   artificially heated, was a ‘stove’ once.
U||   When a certain Frenchman came to visit Melanchthon, he found him in his
U||   stove, with one hand dandling his child in the swaddling-clouts, and
U||   the other holding a book and reading it.—Fuller, Holy State, b. ii. c.
U||   9.
U||   How tedious is it to them that live in stoves and caves half a year
U||   together, as in Iceland, Muscovy, or under the pole!—Burton, Anatomy of
U||   Melancholy, part i. sect. 2.
U||   When most of the waiters were commanded away to their supper, the
U||   parlour or stove being nearly emptied, in came a company of musketeers,
U||   shot every one his man, and so proceeded to an apothecary’s house,
U||   where Wallenstein lay.—Letters and Despatches of Thomas Earl of
U||   Strafford, vol. i. p. 226.
U||   Street. This, one of the words which the Romans left behind them when
U||   they quitted Britain,[Pg 268] and which the Saxons learned from the
U||   Britons, is more properly a road or causeway (‘via strata’) than a
U||   street, in our present sense of the word; and as late as Coverdale was
U||   so used.
U||   For they soughte them thorow every strete, and yet they founde them
U||   not.—Josh. ii. 22. Coverdale.
U||   But when one sawe that all the people stode there still, he removed
U||   Amasa from the strete unto the felde.—1 Sam. xx. 12. Coverdale.
U||   Sublime. There is an occasional use of ‘sublime’ by our earlier poets,
U||   a use in which it bears much the meaning of the Greek ὑπερήφανος, or
U||   perhaps approaches still more closely to that of μετέωρος, high and
U||   lifted up, as with pride; which has now quite departed from it.
U||   For the proud Soldan, with presumptuous cheer
U||   And countenance sublime and insolent,
U||   Sought only slaughter and avengément.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, v. 8, 30.
U||   Their hearts were jocund and sublime,
U||   Drunk with idolatry, drunk with wine.
U||   Milton, Samson Agonistes, 1669.
U||   Sue. One now ‘sues’ or follows another into the courts of law, being,
U||   as in the legal language of Greece, ὁ διώκων, the ‘pursuer;’ but ‘to
U||   sue’ was once to follow, without any such limitation of meaning.
U||   If thou wolt be perfite, go, and sille alle thingis that thou hast, and
U||   come, and sue me.—Matt. xix. 21. Wiclif.
U||   And anoon thei leften the nettis and sueden hym.—Mark i. 19. Id.
U||   [Pg 269]
U||   Sure. Used once in the sense of affianced, or, as it would be sometimes
U||   called, ‘hand-fasted.’ See ‘Assure,’ ‘Ensure.’
U||   The king was sure to dame Elizabeth Lucy, and her husband before
U||   God.—Sir T. More, History of King Richard III.
U||   Suspect,   }
U||   Suspicion.
U||   To ‘suspect’ is properly to look under, and out of this fact is derived
U||   our present use of the word; but in looking under you may also look up,
U||   and herein lies the explanation of an occasional use of ‘suspect’ and
U||   ‘suspicion’ which we find in our early writers.
U||   Pelopidas being sent the second time into Thessaly, to make accord
U||   betwixt the people and Alexander, the tyrant of Pheres, was by this
U||   tyrant (not suspecting the dignity of an ambassador, nor of his
U||   country) made prisoner.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 927.
U||   If God do intimate to the spirit of any wise inferiors that they ought
U||   to reprove, then let them suspect their own persons, and beware that
U||   they make no open contestation, but be content with privacy.—Rogers,
U||   Naaman the Syrian, p. 330.
U||   Cordeilla, out of mere love, without the suspicion of expected reward,
U||   at the message only of her father in distress, pours forth true filial
U||   tears.—Milton, History of England, b. i.
U||   Sycophant. The early meaning of ‘sycophant,’ when it was employed as
U||   equivalent to informer, delator, calumniator, ‘promoter’ (which see),
U||   agreed better with its use in the Greek than does our present.
U||   Employing it now in the sense of false and fawning flatterer, we might
U||   seem at first sight to employ it in a sense not merely altogether
U||   unconnected with, but quite opposite to, its former. Yet[Pg 270] indeed
U||   there is a very deep inner connexion between the two uses. It is not
U||   for nothing that Jeremy Taylor treats of these two, namely ‘Of Slander
U||   and Flattery,’ in one and the same course of sermons; seeing that, as
U||   the Italian proverb has taught us, ‘He who flatters me before, spatters
U||   me behind.’
U||   The poor man, that hath nought to lose, is not afraid of the sycophant
U||   or promoter.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 261.
U||   He [St. Paul] in peril of the wilderness, that is of wild beasts; they
U||   [rich men] not only of the wild beast called the sycophant, but of the
U||   tame beast too, called the flatterer.—Andrewes, Sermon preached at the
U||   Spittle.
U||   Sanders, that malicious sycophant, will have no less than twenty-six
U||   wain-load of silver, gold, and precious stones to be seized into the
U||   king’s hands by the spoil of that monument.—Heylin, History of the
U||   Reformation, 1849, vol. i. p. 20.
U||   Symbol. The employment of ‘symbol’ in its proper Greek sense of
U||   contribution thrown into a common stock, as in a pic-nic or the like,
U||   is frequent in Jeremy Taylor, and examples of it may be found in other
U||   scholarly writers of the seventeenth century.
U||   The consideration of these things hath oft suggested, and at length
U||   persuaded me to make this attempt, to cast in my mite to this treasury,
U||   my symbolum toward so charitable a work.—Hammond, A Paraphrase on the
U||   Psalms, Preface.
U||   Christ hath finished his own sufferings for expiation of the world; yet
U||   there are ‘portions that are behind of the sufferings’ of Christ, which
U||   must be filled up by his body the Church; and happy are they that put
U||   in the greatest symbol; for ‘in the same measure you are partakers of
U||   the sufferings of Christ, in the same shall ye be also of the
U||   consolation.’—Bishop Taylor, The Faith and Patience of the Saints.
U||   [Pg 271]
U||   There [in Westminster Abbey] the warlike and the peaceful, the
U||   fortunate and the miserable, the beloved and the despised princes,
U||   mingle their dust and pay down their symbol of mortality.—Id., Holy
U||   Dying, c. i. § 2.
U||   Table. The Latin ‘tabula’ had for one of its meanings picture or
U||   painting; and this caused that ‘table’ was by our early writers used
U||   often in the same meaning.
U||   The table wherein Detraction was expressed, he [Apelles] painted in
U||   this form.—Sir T. Elyot, The Governor, b. iii. c. 27.
U||   You shall see, as it were in a table painted before your eyes, the
U||   evil-favouredness and deformity of this most detestable vice.—Homilies:
U||   Against Contention.
U||   Learning flourished yet in the city of Sicyon, and they esteemed the
U||   painting of tables in that city to be the perfectest for true colours
U||   and fine drawing, of all other places.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 843.
U||   Taint. This and ‘tint’ or ‘teint,’ the one connected more closely with
U||   the French, the other with the Italian form of the word, have divided
U||   off from one another, but own a common origin—‘tingo,’ ‘tinctus.’ The
U||   fact that discoloration commonly accompanies decay explains our present
U||   use of ‘taint.’
U||   A most delicate and beautiful young lady, slender of body, tall of
U||   stature, fair of taynt and complexion.—Reynolds, God’s Revenge against
U||   Murther, b. i. hist. 1.
U||   But in the court be quainter dames than she,
U||   Whose faces are enrich’d with honour’s taint.
U||   Greene, Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay, sc. 1.
U||   And Nero will be tainted with remorse.
U||   Shakespeare, 3 Henry VI., act iii. sc. 1.
U||   [Pg 272]
U||   Talent. The original meaning, as of ‘talent’ in Old French, ‘talento’
U||   in Italian, ‘talante’ in Spanish, was will, inclination, from
U||   ‘talentum’ (τάλαντον), balance, scales, and then inclination of
U||   balance; thus in Spenser (Fairy Queen, iii. 4, 61), ‘maltalent’ is
U||   grudge or ill-will (compare Old French ‘maltalant’ in the Chanson de
U||   Roland, 271). It is probably under the influence of the Parable of the
U||   Talents (Matt. xxv.) that it has travelled to its present meaning.
U||   Clarendon still employs it very distinctly in its older sense.
U||   Whoso then wold wel understonde these peines, and bethinke him wel that
U||   he hath deserved these peines for his sinnes, certes he shold have more
U||   talent for to sighe and to wepe than for to singe and playe.—Chaucer,
U||   The Persones Tale.
U||   The meaner sort rested not there, but creating for their leader Sir
U||   John Egremond, a factious person and one who had of a long time borne
U||   an ill talent towards the king, entered into open rebellion.—Bacon,
U||   History of King Henry VII.
U||   Though the nation generally was without any ill talent to the Church,
U||   either in the point of the doctrine or the discipline, yet they were
U||   not without a jealousy that Popery was not enough
U||   discountenanced.—Clarendon, History of the Rebellion, b. i. c. 194.
U||   Tall. [This word occurs in earlier English with a great variety of
U||   meanings. A very common meaning is seemly, fine, elegant; for examples
U||   see Oliphant’s New English (index). In old plays it often meant
U||   valiant, brave, great (Halliwell). In the Complaint of Mars ‘talle’
U||   occurs, apparently in the sense of obedient, docile (see Skeat, Minor
U||   Poems of Chaucer, iv. 38). The word in the sense of lofty in stature
U||   may[Pg 273] perhaps be distinct from the above ‘tall’; at any rate the
U||   modern sense of tall seems to be the primary one in the Welsh and
U||   Cornish tal, high. See Skeat’s Dictionary.]
U||   Tal, or semely, Decens, elegans.—Promptorium.
U||   He [the Earl of Richmond’s] companions being almost in despair of
U||   victory were suddenly recomforted by Sir William Stanley, which came to
U||   succours with three thousand tall men.—Grafton, Chronicle.
U||   Tamburlaine. Where are my common soldiers now, that fought
U||   So lionlike upon Asphaltis’ plains?
U||   Soldier. Here, my lord.
U||   Tamburlaine. Hold ye, tall soldiers, take ye queens apiece.
U||   Marlowe, Tamburlaine the Great, part ii. act iv. sc. 4.
U||   He [Prince Edward] would proffer to fight with any mean person, if
U||   cried up for a tall man.—Fuller, Holy War, b. iv. c. 29.
U||   Tarpaulin. Not any longer used in the sense of sailor, except in the
U||   shorter form of ‘tar.’ See the quotation from Smollett, s. v.
U||   ‘Companion.’
U||   The Archbishop of Bordeaux is at present General of the French naval
U||   forces, who though a priest, is yet permitted to turn tarpaulin and
U||   soldier.--Turkish Spy, Letter 2.
U||   Tawdry. ‘Tawdry’ laces and such like were cheap and showy articles of
U||   finery bought at St. Etheldrida’s or St. Awdry’s fair; but it is only
U||   in later times that this cheapness, showiness, with a further
U||   suggestion of vulgarity, made themselves distinctly felt in the word.
U||   [The Old English form of ‘Etheldrida’ was ‘Æthelthry̅th,’ which means
U||   noble strength. See Sweet, Oldest English Texts, p. 638.]
U||   [Pg 274]
U||   Bind your fillets fast,
U||   And gird in your waist
U||   For more fineness with a tawdry lace.
U||   Spenser, Shepherd’s Calendar, Fourth Eclogue.
U||   Come, you promised me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet
U||   gloves.—Shakespeare, Winter’s Tale, act iv. sc. 3.
U||   Temper. What has been said under ‘Humour,’ which see, will also explain
U||   ‘Temper,’ and the earlier uses of it which we meet. The happy ‘temper’
U||   would be the happy mixture, the blending in due proportions, of the
U||   four principal ‘humours’ of the body.
U||   The exquisiteness of his [the Saviour’s] bodily temper increased the
U||   exquisiteness of his torment, and the ingenuity of his soul added to
U||   his sensibleness of the indignities and affronts offered to
U||   him.—Fuller, A Pisgah Sight of Palestine, vol. i. p. 345.
U||   Concupiscence itself follows the crasis and temperature of the body. If
U||   you would know why one man is proud, another cruel, another intemperate
U||   or luxurious, you are not to repair so much to Aristotle’s ethics, or
U||   to the writings of other moralists, as to those of Galen, or of some
U||   anatomists, to find the reason of these different tempers.—South,
U||   Sermons, 1744, vol. ii. p. 5.
U||   Temperament. The Latin ‘temperamentum’ had sometimes very nearly the
U||   sense of our English ‘compromise’ or the French ‘transaction,’ and
U||   signified, as these do, a middle term reached by mutual concession, by
U||   a tempering of the extreme claims upon either side. This same use of
U||   ‘temperament’ appears from time to time in such of our writers as have
U||   allowed their style to be modified by their Latin studies.
U||   [Pg 275]
U||   Safest, therefore, to me it seems that none of the Council be moved
U||   unless by death, or just conviction of some crime. However, I forejudge
U||   not any probable expedient, any temperament that can be found in things
U||   of this nature, so disputable on either side.—Milton, The Ready and
U||   Easy Way to establish a Free Commonwealth.
U||   Many temperaments and explanations there would have been, if ever I had
U||   a notion that it [Observations on the Minority] should meet the public
U||   eye.—Burke, Letter to Lawrence.
U||   Termagant. A name at this present applied only to women of fierce
U||   temper and ungoverned tongue, but formerly to men and women alike; and
U||   indeed predominantly to men; ‘Termagant’ in the popular notion being
U||   the name of one of the three gods of the Saracens. [See Mayhew-Skeat,
U||   Dict. of Middle English (s. v. ‘Tervagant’).]
U||   Art thou so fierce, currish, and churlish a Nabal, that even when thou
U||   mightest live in the midst of thy people (as she told Elisha [2 Kings
U||   iv. 13]), thou delightest to play the tyrant and termagant among
U||   them?—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 270.
U||   This would make a saint swear like a soldier, and a soldier like
U||   Termagant.—Beaumont and Fletcher, King or No King.
U||   Thews. It is a remarkable evidence of the influence of Shakespeare upon
U||   the English language, that while, so far as yet has been observed,
U||   every other writer, one single instance excepted, employs ‘thews’ in
U||   the sense of manners, qualities of mind and disposition, his employment
U||   of it in the sense of nerves, muscular vigour, has quite overborne the
U||   other; which, once so familiar in our literature, has[Pg 276] now quite
U||   passed away. See a valuable note in Craik’s English of Shakespeare, p.
U||   117.
U||   To alle gode thewes born was she;
U||   As lyked to the goddes, or she was born,
U||   That of the shefe she sholde be the corn.

U||   Id., ib., 10, 59.
U||   Think,      }
U||   Thought,
U||   Thoughtful.
U||   Many, as they read or hear in our English Bible these words of our
U||   Lord, ‘Take no thought for your life’ (Matt. vi. 25; cf. 1 Sam. ix. 5),
U||   are perplexed, for they cannot help feeling that there is some
U||   exaggeration in them, that He is urging here something which is
U||   impossible, and which, if possible, would not be desirable, but a
U||   forfeiting of the true dignity of man. Or perhaps, if they are able to
U||   compare the English with the Greek, they blame our Translators for
U||   having given an emphasis to the precept which it did not possess in the
U||   original. But neither is the fact. ‘Thought’ is constantly anxious care
U||   in our earlier English, as the examples which follow will abundantly
U||   prove; and ‘to think,’ though not so frequently, is to take anxious
U||   care. To this day they will say in Yorkshire, ‘it was thought that did
U||   for her,’ meaning that it was care that killed her.
U||   Cleopatra. What shall we do, Enobarbus?
U||   Enobarbus. Think and die.
U||   Shakespeare, Antony and Cleopatra, act iii. sc. 13.
U||   Yet, for his love that all hath wrought,
U||   [Pg 277]

U||   Skelton, Manerly Margery.
U||   He so plagued and vexed his father with injurious indignities, that the
U||   old man for very thought and grief of heart pined away and
U||   died.—Holland, Camden’s Ireland, p. 120.
U||   In five hundred years only two queens have died in childbirth. Queen
U||   Catherine Parr died rather of thought.—Somers’ Tracts (Reign of
U||   Elizabeth), vol. i. p. 172.

U||   and anxiety before his business came to an end.—Bacon, History of Henry
U||   VII.
U||   O thoughtful herte, plungyd in dystres.
U||   Lydgate, Lyf of Our Lady.
U||   Thrifty. The ‘thrifty’ is on the way to be the thriving; yet ‘thrifty’
U||   does not mean thriving now, as once it did. It still indeed retains
U||   this meaning in provincial use; as I have heard a newly-transplanted
U||   tree, which was doing well, described as ‘thrifty.’ See ‘Unthrifty;’
U||   and the quotation from Tusser, s. v. ‘Family.’
U||   No grace hath more abundant promises made unto it than this of mercy, a
U||   sowing, a reaping, a thrifty grace.—Bishop Reynolds, Sermon 30.
U||   Tidy. This, identical with the German ‘zeitig,’ has lost that reference
U||   to time which in ‘noontide,’ ‘eventide,’ and some other compounds still
U||   survives.
U||   Seven eares wexen fette of coren
U||   On an busk ranc and wel tidi.

U||   suffrynge til he resseyve tymeful and lateful fruit—that is tidi and
U||   ripe.—James v. 7. Wiclif.
U||   Tinsel. This (the Old French ‘estincelle,’ a spark) is always now cheap
U||   finery, flashing like silver and gold, but at the same time pretending
U||   a value and a richness which it does not really possess. There lay no
U||   such insinuation of pretentious splendour in its earlier uses. A
U||   valuable note in Keightley’s Milton, vol. i. p. 126, makes it, I think,
U||   clear that by ‘tinsel’ was commonly meant ‘a silver texture, less dense
U||   and stout than cloth of silver;’ yet not always, for see my first
U||   quotation.
U||   Under a duke, no man to wear cloth of gold tinsel.—Literary Remains of
U||   King Edward VI., 1551, 2.
U||   Every place was hanged with cloth of gold, cloth of silver, tinsel,
U||   arras, tapestry, and what not.—Stubbes, Anatomy of Abuses, p. 18.

U||   For cloth of gold, or tinsel figurie,
U||   For baudkin, broidery, cutworks, nor conceits.

U||   Tobacconist. Now the seller, once the smoker, of tobacco.
U||   Germany hath not so many drunkards, England tobacconists, France
U||   dancers, Holland mariners, as Italy alone hath jealous
U||   husbands.—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy, part iii. sect. 3.

U||   Hence it is that the lungs of the tobacconist are rotted.—Ben Jonson,
U||   Bartholomew Fair.
U||   But let it be of any truly said,

U||   But he is lately turned tobacconist,
U||   Oh what a blur! what an abatement is’t!
U||   Sylvester, Tobacco Battered.
U||   Tory. It is curious how often political parties have ended by assuming
U||   to themselves names first fastened on them by their adversaries in
U||   reproach and scorn. The ‘Gueux’ or ‘Beggars’ of Holland are perhaps the
U||   most notable instance of all; so too ‘tories’ was a name properly
U||   belonging to the Irish bogtrotters, who during our Civil War robbed and
U||   plundered, professing to be in arms for the maintenance of the royal
U||   cause; and from them transferred, about the year 1680, to those who
U||   sought to maintain the extreme prerogatives of the Crown. There is an
U||   Act of the 6th of Anne with this title: ‘For the more effectual
U||   suppressing Tories and Rapparees; and for preventing persons becoming
U||   Tories or resorting to them.’ For the best account of the ‘tories’ see
U||   Prendergast, Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland, pp. 163-183; and
U||   compare Carte’s Life of the Duke of Ormonde, vol. ii. p. 481.
U||   That Irish Papists who had been licensed to depart this nation, and of
U||   late years have been transplanted into Spain, Flanders, and other

U||   State Papers, 24th January, 1656.
U||   Let such men quit all pretences to civility and breeding. They are

U||   [Pg 280]
U||   In the open or plain countries the peasants are content to live on
U||   their labour; the woods, bogs, and fastnesses fostering and sheltering
U||   the robbers, tories, and woodkerns, who are usually the offspring of
U||   gentlemen, that have either misspent or forfeited their estates; who,
U||   though having no subsistance, yet contemn trade, as being too mean and
U||   base for a gentleman reduced never so low.—MS. Account of the State of
U||   the County of Kildare, of date 1684, in Trinity College Library,
U||   Dublin.

U||   Trade. Properly that path which we ‘tread,’ and thus the ever recurring
U||   habit and manner of our life, whatever this may be.
U||   A postern with a blinde wicket there was,
U||   A common trade to passe through Priam’s house.

U||   Teach a child in the trade of his way, and when he is old, he shall not

U||   Treacle. This at present means only the sweet syrup of molasses, but
U||   was once of far wider reach and far nobler significance, having come to
U||   us from afar, and by steps which are curious to trace. They[Pg 281] are
U||   these. The Greeks, in anticipation of modern homœopathy, called a
U||   fancied antidote to the viper’s bite, which was composed of the viper’s
U||   flesh, θηριακά—from θηρίον, a name often given to the viper (Acts
U||   xxviii. 5); of this came the Latin ‘theriaca,’ from the Old French form
U||   of which—namely, ‘triacle’—came our ‘triacle’ and ‘treacle.’ See
U||   Promptorium, and Mayhew-Skeat, Dict. of Middle English, p. 237.
U||   For a most strong treacle against these venomous heresies wrought our
U||   Saviour many a marvellous miracle.—Sir T. More, A Treatise on the
U||   Passion, Works, p. 1357.
U||   There is no more triacle at Galaad, and there is no phisician that can
U||   heale the hurte of my people.—Jer. viii. 22. Coverdale.
U||   At last his body [Sir Thomas Overbury’s] was almost come by use of
U||   poisons to the state that Mithridates’ body was by the use of treacle
U||   and preservatives, that the force of the poisons was blunted upon
U||   him.—Bacon, Charge against Robert, Earl of Somerset.
U||   The saints’ experiences help them to a sovereign treacle made of the
U||   scorpion’s own flesh (which they through Christ have slain), and that
U||   hath a virtue above all others to expel the venom of Satan’s
U||   temptations from the heart.—Gurnall, The Christian in Complete Armour,
U||   c. ix. § 2.
U||   Wonderful therefore is the power of a Christian, who not only overcomes
U||   and conquers and kills the viper, but like the skilful apothecary makes
U||   antidote and triacle of him.—Hales, Sermon on Christian Omnipotence.
U||   Treacle; a physical composition, made of vipers and other
U||   ingredients.—Phillips, New World of Words.
U||   Tree. This might once have been used of the dead timber, no less than
U||   of the living growth; this use surviving still in ‘roodtree,’
U||   ‘axletree,’ ‘saddletree.’
U||   [Pg 282]
U||   In a greet hous ben not oneli vessels of gold and of silver, but also
U||   of tree [lignea, Vulg.] and of erthe.—2 Tim. ii. 20. Wiclif.

U||   of England, p. 145.

U||   Set up a mast of tree;
U||   Ill sets it a forsaken lady

U||   Old Ballad.
U||   Triumph. A name often transferred by our early writers to any stately
U||   show or pageantry whatever, not restricted, as now, to one celebrating
U||   a victory. See Bacon’s Essay, the 37th, with the heading ‘Of Masks and
U||   Triumphs,’ passim.
U||   Our daughter,
U||   In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,
U||   Sits here, like beauty’s child.
U||   Pericles, Prince of Tyre, act ii. sc. 2.
U||   You cannot have a perfect palace except you have two several sides, the
U||   one for feasts and triumphs, the other for dwelling.—Bacon, Essays, 45.
U||   This day to Dagon is a solemn feast,
U||   With sacrifices, triumph, pomp, and games.
U||   Milton, Samson Agonistes, 1311.
U||   Trivial. A ‘trivial’ saying is at present a slight one; it was formerly
U||   an often-repeated one, or one containing an elementary truth; it might
U||   be trite, on the ground of the weight and wisdom which it contained; as
U||   certainly the maxim quoted by Hacket is anything but ‘trivial’ in our
U||   sense of the word. Gradually the notion of slightness was superadded to
U||   that of commonness, and thus an epithet[Pg 283] once of honour has
U||   become one of dishonour rather. See Mayhew-Skeat, Dict. of Middle
U||   English (s. v. ‘Trivials’).
U||   Others avouch, and that more truly, that he [Duns Scotus] was born in
U||   Downe, and thereof they guess him to be named Dunensis, and by
U||   contraction Duns, which term is so trivial and common in schools, that
U||   whoso surpasseth others either in cavilling sophistry or subtle
U||   philosophy is forthwith nicknamed a Duns.—Stanyhurst, Description of
U||   Ireland, p. 2.
U||   Æquitas optimo cuique notissima, is a trivial saying, A very good man
U||   cannot be ignorant of equity.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop Williams, part
U||   i. p. 57.
U||   These branches [of the divine life] are three, whose names though
U||   trivial and vulgar, yet, if rightly understood, they bear such a sense
U||   with them that nothing more weighty can be pronounced by the tongue of
U||   men or seraphims, and in brief they are these, Charity, Humility, and
U||   Purity.—H. More, Grand Mystery of Godliness, b. ii. c. 12.
U||   Trumpery. That which is deceitful is without any worth; and ‘trumpery,’
U||   which was formerly deceit, fraud (tromperie), is now anything which is
U||   worthless and of no account. Was Milton’s use of the word in his
U||   well-known line, ‘Black, white and gray, with all their trumpery’ (P.
U||   L. iii. 475), our present, or that earlier?
U||   When truth appeared, Rogero hated more
U||   Alcyna’s trumperies, and did them detest,
U||   Than he was late enamourèd before.
U||   Sir J. Harington, Orlando Furioso, b. vii.
U||   Britannicus was now grown to men’s estate, a true and worthy plant to
U||   receive his father’s empire; which a grafted son by adoption now
U||   possessed by the injury and trumpery of his mother.—Greenwey, Tacitus,
U||   p. 182.
U||   Turk. It is a remarkable evidence of the extent to which the Turks and
U||   the Turkish assault upon[Pg 284] Christendom had impressed themselves
U||   on the minds of men, of the way in which they stood as representing the
U||   entire Mahometan world, that ‘Turk,’ being in fact a national, is
U||   constantly employed by the writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth
U||   centuries as a religious, designation, as equivalent to, and
U||   coextensive with, Mahometan; exactly as Ἔλλην in the New Testament
U||   means continually not of Greek nationality, but of Gentile religion.
U||   Have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, infidels, and heretics.—Collect for
U||   Good Friday.
U||   It is no good reason for a man’s religion, that he was born and brought
U||   up in it; for then a Turk would have as much reason to be a Turk as a
U||   Christian to be a Christian.—Chillingworth, Religion of Protestants,
U||   part i. c. 2.
U||   Tutor,   }
U||   Tuition.
U||   The ‘tutor’ of our forefathers was rather a caretaker and guardian than
U||   an instructor: but seeing that one defends another most effectually who
U||   imparts to him those principles and that knowledge whereby he shall be
U||   able to defend himself, our modern use of the word must be taken as a
U||   deeper than the earlier.
U||   This is part of the honour that the children owe to their parents and
U||   tutors by the commandment of God, even to be bestowed in marriage as it
U||   pleaseth the godly, prudent and honest parents or tutors to
U||   appoint.—Becon, Catechism, Parker Soc. ed., p. 871.
U||   What shall become of the lambs under the tuition of wolves?—Adams,
U||   Sermons, vol. ii. p. 117.
U||   Tutors and guardians are in the place of parents; and what they are in
U||   fiction of law they must remember as an argument to engage them to do
U||   in reality of duty.—Bishop Taylor, Holy Living, iii. 2.
U||   [Pg 285]
U||   As though they were not to be trusted with the king’s brother, that by
U||   the assent of the nobles of the land were appointed, as the king’s
U||   nearest friends, to the tuition of his own royal person.—Sir T. More,
U||   History of King Richard III., p. 36.
U||   Afterwards turning his speech to his wife and his son, he [Scanderbeg]
U||   commended them both with his kingdom to the tuition of the
U||   Venetians.—Knolles, History of the Turks, vol. i. p. 274.
U||   Umbrage,    }
U||   Umbrageous.
U||   ‘To take umbrage’ is, I think, the only phrase in which the word
U||   ‘umbrage’ is still in use among us, the only one at least in which it
U||   is ethically employed; but ‘umbrage’ in its earlier use coincides in
U||   meaning with the old French ‘ombrage’ (see the quotation from Bacon),
U||   and signifies suspicion, or rather the disposition to suspect; and
U||   ‘umbrageous,’ as far as I know, is constantly employed in the sense of
U||   suspicious by our early authors; having now no other but a literal
U||   sense. Other uses of ‘umbrage,’ as those of Fuller and Jeremy Taylor
U||   which follow, must be explained from the classical sympathies of these
U||   writers; out of which the Latin etymology of the word gradually made
U||   itself felt in the meaning which they ascribed to it, namely as
U||   anything slight and shadowy. [For the development of meaning of the
U||   French ‘ombrage’ from shadow to suspicion, see Darmesteter, Vie des
U||   Mots, p. 77.]
U||   I say, just fear, not out of umbrages, light jealousies, apprehensions
U||   afar off, but out of clear foresight of imminent danger.—Bacon, Of a
U||   War with Spain.
U||   To collect the several essays of princes glancing on that project [a
U||   new Crusade], were a task of great pains and small profit; especially
U||   some of them being umbrages and state[Pg 286] representations rather
U||   than realities, to ingratiate princes with their subjects, or with the
U||   oratory of so pious a project to woo money out of people’s
U||   purses.—Fuller, Holy War, b. v. c. 25.
U||   You look for it [truth] in your books, and you tug hard for it in your
U||   disputations, and you derive it from the cisterns of the Fathers, and
U||   you inquire after the old ways; and sometimes are taken with new
U||   appearances, and you rejoice in false lights, or are delighted with
U||   little umbrages or peep of day.—Bishop Taylor, Sermon preached to the
U||   University of Dublin.
U||   There being in the Old Testament thirteen types and umbrages of this
U||   Holy Sacrament, eleven of them are of meat and drink.—Id., The Worthy
U||   Communicant, c. ii. § 2.
U||   At the beginning some men were a little umbrageous, and startling at
U||   the name of the Fathers; yet since the Fathers have been well studied,
U||   we have behaved ourselves with more reverence toward the Fathers than
U||   they of the Roman persuasion have done.—Donne, Sermons, 1640, p. 557.
U||   That there was none other present but himself when his master De Merson
U||   was murdered, it is umbrageous, and leaves a spice of fear and sting of
U||   suspicion in their heads.—Reynolds, God’s Revenge against Murther, b.
U||   iii. hist. 13.
U||   Uncouth. Now unformed in manner, ungraceful in behaviour; but once
U||   simply unknown. The change in signification is to be traced to the same
U||   causes which made ‘barbarous,’ meaning at first only foreign, to have
U||   afterwards the sense of savage and wild. Almost all nations regard with
U||   disfavour and dislike that which is outlandish, and generally that with
U||   which they are unacquainted; so that words which at first did but
U||   express this fact of strangeness, easily acquire a further unfavourable
U||   sense.
U||   The vulgar instruction requires also vulgar and communicable terms, not
U||   clerkly or uncouth, as are all these of the[Pg 287] Greek and Latin
U||   languages.—Puttenham, Art of English Poesy, b. iii. c. 10.
U||   Wel-away the while I was so fonde,
U||   To leave the good that I had in honde
U||   In hope of better that was uncouth;
U||   So lost the Dogge the flesh in his mouth.
U||   Spenser, The Shepherd’s Calendar, September.
U||   ‘Uncouthe, unkiste,’ sayde the old famous poete Chaucer; which proverb
U||   very well taketh place in this our new poete, who for that he is
U||   uncouthe (as said Chaucer) is unkist; and, unknown to most men, is
U||   regarded but of a few.—E. K., Epistle Dedicatory prefixed to Spenser’s
U||   Shepherd’s Calendar.
U||   Unequal. From the constant use made of ‘unequal’ by our early writers,
U||   for whom it was entirely equivalent to unjust, unfair, one might almost
U||   suppose they were influenced by sense association with ‘iniquus’ in
U||   their naturalization of ‘inæqualis.’ At any rate they had no scruple in
U||   using it in a sense, which ‘inæqualis’ never has, but ‘iniquus’
U||   continually.
U||   To punish me for what you make me do
U||   Seems most unequal.
U||   Shakespeare, Antony and Cleopatra, act ii. sc. 5.
U||   These imputations are too common, sir,
U||   And easily stuck on virtue when she’s poor:
U||   You are unequal to me.

U||   Jerome, a very unequal relator of the opinion of his
U||   adversaries.—Worthington, Life of Joseph Mede, p. xi.
U||   Uneasy. This has lost the sense of ‘difficult,’ and means now restless
U||   or anxious. But the objective signification is to be found in our Bible
U||   and in Shakespeare.
U||   [Pg 288]
U||   The town was hard to besiege and uneasy to come unto.—2 Macc. xii. 21.

U||   Make the prize light.

U||   Unhandsome. See ‘Handsome.’
U||   A narrow straight path by the water’s side, very unhandsome [οὐ ῥᾳδίαν]
U||   for an army to pass that way, though they found not a man to keep the
U||   passage.—North, Plutarch’s Lives, p. 317; cf. p. 378.
U||   The ships were unwieldy and unhandsome.—Holland, Livy, p. 1188.
U||   Unhappy,     }
U||   Unhappiness.
U||   A very deep truth lies involved in the fact that so many words, and I
U||   suppose in all languages, unite the meanings of wicked and miserable,
U||   as the Greek σχέτλιος, our own ‘wretch’ and ‘wretched.’ So, too, it was
U||   once with ‘unhappy,’ although its use in the sense of ‘wicked’ has now
U||   passed away.
U||   Fathers shall do well also to keep from them [their children] such
U||   schoolfellows as be unhappy, and given to shrewd turns; for such as
U||   they are enough to corrupt and mar the best natures in the
U||   world.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals, p. 16.
U||   Thou old unhappy traitor,
U||   Briefly thyself remember; the sword is out
U||   That must destroy thee.
U||   Shakespeare, King Lear, act iv. sc. 6.
U||   The servants of Dionyse, king of Sicily, which although they were
U||   inclined to all unhappiness and mischief, yet after the coming of
U||   Plato, perceiving that for his doctrine and wisdom the king had him in
U||   high estimation, they thus counterfeited the countenance and habit of
U||   the philosopher.—Sir T. Elyot, The Governor, b. ii. c. 14.
U||   [Pg 289]
U||   [Man] from the hour of his birth is most miserable, weak, and sickly;
U||   when he sucks, he is guided by others; when he is grown great,

U||   repenteth him of his past life.—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy;
U||   Democritus to the Reader.
U||   Union. The elder Pliny (H. N. ix. 59) tells us that the name ‘unio’ had
U||   not very long before his time begun to be given to a pearl in which all
U||   chiefest excellencies, size, roundness, smoothness, whiteness, weight,
U||   met and, so to speak, were united; and as late as Jeremy Taylor the
U||   word ‘union’ was often employed to designate a pearl of a rare and
U||   transcendent beauty. See Skeat’s Dictionary (s. v. ‘Onion’).
U||   And in the cup an union shall he throw,
U||   Richer than that which four successive kings
U||   In Denmark’s crown have worn.
U||   Shakespeare, Hamlet, act v. sc. 2.
U||   Pope Paul II. in his pontifical vestments outwent all his predecessors,
U||   especially in his mitre, upon which he had laid out a great deal of

U||   crysoliths, jaspers, unions, and all manner of precious stones.—Sir
U||   Paul Rycaut, Platina’s History of the Popes, p. 114.
U||   Perox, the Persian king, [hath] an union in his ear worth an hundred
U||   weight of gold.—Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy, mem. ii. sect. 3.
U||   Unkind,     }
U||   Unkindness.
U||   ‘Unkind’ has quite forfeited now its primary meaning, namely that which
U||   violates the law of kind, thus ‘unkind abominations’ (Chaucer), meaning
U||   incestuous unions and the like; and has taken up with the secondary,
U||   that which does not recognise the duties flowing out of this kinship.
U||   In its primary meaning it moves in a region where the physical and
U||   ethical meet; in its[Pg 290] secondary in a purely ethical sphere. How
U||   soon it began to occupy this the passages which follow will show; for
U||   out of a sense that nothing was so unnatural or ‘unkind’ as
U||   ingratitude, the word early obtained use as a special designation of
U||   this vice.
U||   Unkynde [ingrati, Vulg.], cursid, withouten affeccioun.—2 Tim. iii. 2,
U||   3. Wiclif.
U||   It is all one to sey unkinde,
U||   As thing whiche doone is againe kinde,
U||   For it with kinde never stoode
U||   A man to yelde evill for goode.
U||   Gower, Confessio Amantis, b. v.
U||   Whar-for ilk man, bathe lered and lewed,
U||   Suld thinke on that love that He man shewed,
U||   And love Hym and thank Hym als he can,
U||   And elles es he an unkynd man.
U||   Richard Rolle de Hampole, Pricke of Conscience, 117.
U||   The most damnable vice and most against justice, in mine opinion, is
U||   ingratitude, commonly called unkindness. He is unkind that denieth to
U||   have received any benefit, that indeed he hath received; he is unkind
U||   that dissimuleth; he is unkind that recompenseth not; but he is most
U||   unkind that forgetteth.—Sir T. Elyot, The Governor, b. ii. c. 13.
U||   God might have made me even such a foule and unreasonable beast as this
U||   is; and yet was I never so kynde as to thancke Him that He had not made
U||   me so vile a creature; which thing I greatly bewayle, and my
U||   unkindenesse causeth me now thus to weepe.—Frith, Works, 1573, p. 90.
U||   We have cause also in England to beware of unkindnesse, who have had in
U||   so fewe yeares the candel of Goddes woorde, so oft lightned, so oft put
U||   out; and yet will venture by our unthankfulnesse in doctrine, and
U||   sinfull life, to leese againe lighte, candle, candlesticke, and
U||   all.—Ascham, The Scholemaster, b. i.
U||   Unthrifty, [Pg 291] }
U||   Unthriftiness.
U||   As the ‘thrifty’ will probably be the thriving, so the ‘unthrifty’ the
U||   unthriving; but the words are not synonymous any more, as once they
U||   were. See ‘Thrifty.’
U||   What [is it] but this self and presuming of ourselves causes grace to
U||   be unthrifty, and to hang down the head? what but our ascribing to
U||   ourselves in our means-using, makes them so unfruitful?—Rogers, Naaman
U||   the Syrian, p. 146.
U||   Staggering, non-proficiency, and unthriftiness of profession is the
U||   fruit of self.—Id., Index.
U||   Unvalued. This and ‘invaluable’ have been usefully desynonymized; so
U||   that ‘invaluable’ means now having a value greater than can be
U||   estimated, ‘unvalued’ esteemed to have no value at all. Yet it was not
U||   so once; though in Shakespeare (see Hamlet, act i. sc. 3) our present
U||   use of ‘unvalued’ occasionally obtained.
U||   Two golden apples of unvalued price.
U||   Spenser, Sonnet 77.
U||   Go, unvalued book,
U||   Live, and be loved; if any envious look
U||   Hurt thy clear fame, learn that no state more high
U||   Attends on virtue than pined envy’s eye.
U||   Chapman, Dedication of Poems.
U||   Each heart
U||   Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book
U||   Those Delphic lines with deep impression took.
U||   Milton, An Epitaph on Shakespeare.
U||   Usury,  }
U||   Usurer.
U||   This, which is now the lending of money upon inordinate interest, was
U||   once the lending it upon any. The man who did not lend his money for
U||   nothing was then a ‘usurer,’ not he, as now, who makes unworthy profit
U||   by the necessities[Pg 292] of the needy or the extravagance of the
U||   foolish. It is true that the word was as dishonourable then as it is
U||   now; and it could not be otherwise, so long as all receiving of
U||   interest was regarded as a violation at once of divine and of natural
U||   law. When at length the common sense of men overcame this strange but
U||   deep-rooted prejudice, the word was too deeply stained with dishonour
U||   to be employed to express the lawful receiving of a measurable
U||   interest; but ‘usury,’ taking up a portion only of its former meaning,
U||   was now restricted to that which still remained under a moral ban,
U||   namely the exacting of an excessive interest for money lent.
U||   On the other side, the commodities of usury are: first, that howsoever
U||   usury in some respects hindereth merchandising, yet in some other it
U||   advanceth it; for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is
U||   driven by young merchants upon borrowing at interest; so as if the
U||   usurer either call in or keep back his money, there will ensue
U||   presently a great stand of trade.—Bacon, Essay, 41.
U||   Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my
U||   coming I might have required mine own with usury [σὺν τόκῳ]?—Luke xix.
U||   23. (A.V.)
U||   Brokers, takers of pawns, biting usurers I will not admit; yet because
U||   we converse here with men, not with gods, and for the hardness of men’s
U||   hearts, I will tolerate some kind of usury.—Burton, Anatomy of
U||   Melancholy; Democritus to the Reader.
U||   Varlet. Littré, dealing with this very word, has truly said, ‘Les mots,
U||   soit en changeant de pays, soit en changeant de siècle, s’ennoblissent
U||   ou s’avilissent d’une façon singulière’ (Hist. de la Langue Française,
U||   vol. ii. p. 166). There could be no more signal proof of this than that
U||   which the word ‘varlet’ supplies.[Pg 293] I continue to quote his
U||   words, ‘Vaslet, ou, par une substitution non rare de l’r à l’s, varlet,
U||   est un diminutif de vassal; vassal signifiait un vaillant guerrier, et
U||   varlet un jeune homme qui pouvait aspirer aux honneurs de la
U||   chevalerie.’ From this it fell to the use in which we find it in the
U||   passage quoted below from Shakespeare of squire or attendant, which is
U||   also the continually recurring use in the Old English translation of
U||   Froissart. In this sense it survives as ‘valet;’ but not pausing here,
U||   ‘varlet’ is now tinged with contempt, and implies moral worthlessness
U||   in him to whom it is applied.
U||   Call here my varlet; I’ll unarm myself.
U||   Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, act i. sc. 1.
U||   Right so there came in a varlet; and told Sir Tristram how there was
U||   come an errant knight into the town with such colours upon his
U||   shield.—Sir T. Malory, Morte d’Arthur, b. x. c. 56.
U||   Vassalage. This, like the Old French ‘vasselage,’ had once the meaning
U||   of courage, prowess, superiority. See in explanation the quotation from
U||   Littré under ‘Varlet.’
U||   And certeynly a man hath most honour
U||   To deyen in his excellence and flour,
U||   Thanne whan his name appalled is for age;
U||   For all forgeten is his vasselage.
U||   Chaucer, The Knightes Tale, 2189 (Clar. Press).
U||   And Catoun seith is noon so great encress
U||   Of worldly tresour, as for to live in pees,
U||   Which among vertues hath the vasselage.
U||   Lydgate, Minor Poems, Halliwell’s ed., p. 176.
U||   [Pg 294]
U||   Vermin. Now always noxious offensive animals of the smaller kind, but
U||   employed formerly with no such limitation.
U||   But he shouke of the vermen into the fyre and felt no harme.—Acts
U||   xxviii. 5. Geneva Version.
U||   This crocodile is a mischievous four-footed beast, a dangerous vermin
U||   used to both elements.—Holland, Ammianus, p. 212.
U||   Wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and vermin
U||   [καὶ τὰ θηρία], and worms, and fowls of the air.—Acts x. 12. Geneva.
U||   The Lord rectifies Peter, and frames him to go by a vision of all
U||   crawling vermin in a clean sheet.—Rogers, Naaman the Syrian, p. 42.
U||   Vilify. This now implies a great deal more than to hold morally cheap,
U||   which was all that in the seventeenth century it involved.
U||   Can it be imagined that a whole people would ever so vilify themselves,
U||   depart from their own interests to that degree as to place all their
U||   hopes in one man?—Milton, Defence of the People of England, c. 7.
U||   The ears of all men will be filled with deceitful figments and gainful
U||   lies, the merits of Christ’s passion will be vilified and maimed.—H.
U||   More, The Mystery of Iniquity, b. ii. c. 7, § 11.
U||   The more I magnify myself, the more God vilifies me.—Rogers, Naaman the
U||   Syrian, p. 469.
U||   Villain, }
U||   Villany.
U||   A word whose story, like that of ‘churl,’ is so well known that one may
U||   be spared the necessity of repeating it. It was, I think, with
U||   ‘villany’ that there was first a transfer into an ethical sphere,
U||   though it is noticeable how[Pg 295] ‘villany’ till a very late day
U||   expressed words foul and disgraceful to the utterer much oftener than
U||   deeds.
U||   Pour the blood of the villain in one basin, and the blood of the
U||   gentleman in another; what difference shall there be proved?—Becon, The
U||   Jewel of Joy.
U||   We yield not ourselves to be your villains and slaves [non in
U||   servitutem nos tradimus], but as allies to be protected by
U||   you.—Holland, Livy, p. 935.
U||   [He] was condemned to be degraded of all nobility, and not only
U||   himself, but all his succeeding posterity declared villains, and
U||   clowns, taxable and incapable to bear arms.—Florio, Montaigne, b. i. c.
U||   15.
U||   In our modern language it [foul language] is termed villany, as being
U||   proper for rustic boors, or men of coarsest education and employment,
U||   who, having their minds debased by being conversant in meanest affairs,
U||   do vent their sorry passions in such strains.—Barrow, Of Evil-speaking
U||   in general, Sermon 16.
U||   Virtuous. Virtue is still occasionally used as equivalent to might or
U||   potency; but ‘virtuous’ has quite abdicated the meaning of valorous or
U||   potent which it once had, and which its etymology justified.
U||   With this all strengths and minds he moved; but young Deiphobus,
U||   Old Priam’s son, amongst them all was chiefly virtuous.
U||   Chapman, Homer’s Iliad, xiii. 147.
U||   Or call up him that left half told
U||   The story of Cambuscan old,
U||   Of Camball and of Algarsife,
U||   And who had Canace to wife,
U||   That owned the virtuous ring and glass.
U||   Milton, Il Penseroso.
U||   Tho lifting up his vertuous staffe on hye
U||   He smote the sea, which calmèd was with speed.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, ii. 12, 26.
U||   Vivacious, [Pg 296] }
U||   Vivacity.
U||   ‘Longevity’ is a comparatively modern word. ‘Vivacity,’ which has now
U||   acquired the mitigated sense of liveliness, served instead of it;
U||   keeping in English the original sense which ‘vivacitas’ had in the
U||   Latin.
U||   James Sands, of Horborn in this county, is most remarkable for his
U||   vivacity, for he lived 140 years.—Fuller, Worthies of England:
U||   Staffordshire.
U||   Fables are raised concerning the vivacity of the deer; for neither are
U||   their gestation nor increment such as may afford an argument of long
U||   life.—Sir T. Browne, Vulgar Errors.
U||   Hitherto the English bishops had been vivacious almost to wonder. For,
U||   necessarily presumed of good years before entering on their office in
U||   the first year of Queen Elizabeth, it was much that but five died for
U||   the first twenty years of her reign.—Fuller, Church History of Britain,
U||   b. ix. § 27.
U||   Voluble. This epithet always insinuates of him to whom it is now
U||   applied that his speech is freer and faster than is meet; but it once
U||   occupied that region of meaning which ‘fluent’ does at present, without
U||   any suggestion of the kind. Milton (P. L. ix. 436) recalls the word, as
U||   he does so many, to its primary meaning.
U||   He [Archbishop Abbott] was painful, stout, severe against bad manners,
U||   of a grave and a voluble eloquence.—Hacket, Life of Archbishop
U||   Williams, part i. p. 65.
U||   Voyage. All journeys, those alike by land and by water, were ‘voyages’
U||   once. The word is restricted now to journeys made by water. ‘Voyage’ is
U||   the French form of the late Latin ‘viaticum.’
U||   Holofernes went forth with his chariots and horses to go before King
U||   Nebuchodonosor in the voyage.—Judith ii. 19. (A.V.)
U||   [Pg 297]
U||   My life hath not been unexpensive in learning, and voyaging
U||   about.—Milton, An Apology for Smectymnuus.
U||   This is the poynt, to speken schort and pleyn,
U||   That ech of yow to schorte with oure weie
U||   In this viage schal telle tales tweye
U||   To Caunterburi-ward, I mene it so,
U||   And homward he schal tellen othere tuo.
U||   Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, Prologue.
U||   Wainscot. I transcribe a correction of the brief and inaccurate notice
U||   of this word in my first edition, which a correspondent, with the best
U||   opportunity of knowledge, has kindly sent me: ‘“Wainscot” is always in
U||   the building trade applied to oak only, but not to all kinds of oak.
U||   The wainscot oak grows abroad, chiefly, I think, in Holland, and is
U||   used for wainscoting, or wood lining, of walls of houses, because it
U||   works very freely under the tool, and is not liable to “cast” or rend,
U||   as English oak will do. It is consequently used for all purposes where
U||   expense is no object. Formerly all panelling to walls was done in
U||   wainscot, and was called “wainscoting.” It was never painted. In modern
U||   times it was imitated in deal, and was painted to represent real
U||   wainscot, or of any other colour, while the name of “wainscoting”
U||   adhered to it, though the material was no longer wainscot. At present,
U||   however, the word “wainscot” is always used to designate the real
U||   wainscot oak.’ It will be seen from this very interesting explanation
U||   that within the narrow limits of a particular trade, the old meaning of
U||   ‘wainscot,’ which has everywhere else disappeared, still survives. It
U||   would be curious to trace how much in this way of earlier English
U||   within limited technical circles lives[Pg 298] on, having everywhere
U||   else died out. For a further account of ‘wainscot,’ see Skeat’s
U||   Dictionary, p. 833.
U||   A wedge of wainscot is fittest and most proper for cleaving of an oaken
U||   tree.—Sir T. Urquhart, Tracts, p. 153.
U||   Being thus arrayed, and enclosed in a chest of wainscot, he [Edward the
U||   Confessor] was removed into the before-prepared feretry.—Dart, History
U||   of St. Peter’s, Westminster, c. 3.
U||   Want. Among other differences between ‘carere’ and ‘egere,’ this
U||   certainly is one, that the former may be said of things evil as well as
U||   good, as well of those whose absence is desirable as of those whose
U||   absence is felt as a loss, while ‘egere’ always implies not merely the
U||   absence but the painful sense of the absence. ‘To want,’ which had once
U||   the more colourless use of ‘carere,’ has passed now, nearly though not
U||   altogether, into this latter sense, and is = ‘egere.’
U||   If he be lost, and want, thy life shall go for his life.—1 Kings xx.
U||   39. Geneva.
U||   The happy and fortunate want of these beasts [wolves] in England is
U||   universally ascribed to the politic government of King Edgar.—Harrison,
U||   Description of England, b. iii. c. 4.
U||   In a word, he [the true gentleman] is such, that could we want him, it
U||   were pity but that he were in heaven; and yet I pity not much his
U||   continuance here, because he is already so much in heaven to
U||   himself.—Clement Ellis, Character of a True Gentleman.
U||   Friend of my life, which did you not prolong,
U||   The world had wanted many an idle song.
U||   Pope, Lines to Arbuthnot.
U||   Wench. In Middle English this term (in the older form ‘wenchel’), like
U||   ‘girl,’ ‘coquette,’ ‘slut,’[Pg 299] ‘flirt,’ and so many more, might be
U||   ascribed to either sex; and when afterwards restrained to one, was
U||   rather a word of familiarity, or even of passion, than of slight and
U||   contempt, which now it has grown to be. See Mayhew-Skeat’s Dict. of
U||   Middle English.
U||   And, wretched wench, she thinks she has obtained such a thing
U||   As both to Progne and herself should joy and comfort bring.
U||   Golding, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, b. vi.
U||   O, ill-starred wench,
U||   Pale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt
U||   This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven.
U||   Shakespeare, Othello, act v. sc. 2.
U||   The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
U||   As is the razor’s edge invisible.
U||   Id., Love’s Labours Lost, act v. sc. 2.
U||   And going in, He saith to them: Why make ye this ado, and weepe? The
U||   wenche is not dead, but sleepeth.... And holding the wenches hand, He
U||   saith to her, Talitha Cumi.—Mark v. 39, 41. Rheims.
U||   Whirlpool. Formerly used in the sense of some huge sea-monster of the
U||   whale kind. Thus in the margin of our Bible, there is on Job xli. 1
U||   (‘Canst thou draw out leviathan?’) a gloss, ‘that is, a whale or
U||   whirlpool.’ In Harrison’s Description of England, b. iii. c. 5, the
U||   ‘thirlepole’ is mentioned with the porpoise and whale as among the
U||   great fishes of the sea. See Wright’s Bible Word Book.
U||   The Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are, among
U||   which the whales and whirlpools, called balænæ, take up in length as
U||   much as four acres or arpens of land.—Holland, Pliny, vol. i. p. 235.
U||   Great whirlpooles which all fishes make to flee.
U||   Spenser, Fairy Queen, ii. 12, 23.
U||   [Pg 300]
U||   The ork, whirlpool, whale, or huffing physeter.
U||   Sylvester, Du Bartas, First Day of the Week.
U||   About sunset, coming near the Wild Island, Pantagruel spied afar off a
U||   huge monstrous physeter, a sort of whale, which some call a
U||   whirlpool.—Rabelais, Pantagruel, b. iv. c. 33. [This creature is
U||   suggested by ‘Leviathan descript par le noble prophete Moses en la vie
U||   du sainct home Job.’]
U||   Whisperer,  }
U||   Whispering.
U||   There lay in ‘whisperer’ once, as in the ψιθυριστής of the Greeks, the
U||   ‘susurro’ of the Latins, the suggestion of a slanderer or false
U||   accuser, which has now quite passed away from the word.
U||   Now this Doeg, being there at that time, what doeth he? Like a
U||   whisperer or man-pleaser goeth to Saul the king, and told him how the
U||   priest had refreshed David in his journey, and had given unto him the
U||   sword of Goliath.—Latimer, Sermons, Parker edit., p. 486.
U||   A whisperer separateth chief friends.—Prov. xvi. 28; cf. Ecclus. v. 14.
U||   (A.V.)
U||   Kings in ancient times were wont to put great trust in eunuchs. But yet
U||   their trust towards them hath rather been as to good whisperers than
U||   good magistrates and officers.—Bacon, Essay, 44, Of Deformity.
U||   Lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings,
U||   whisperings, swellings, tumults.—2 Cor. xii. 20. (A. V.)
U||   Whiteboy. Formerly a cockered favourite (compare Barnes’s use of ‘white
U||   son,’ Works, 1572, p. 192), but in later years one of the many names
U||   which the perpetrators of agrarian outrages in Ireland either assumed
U||   to themselves, or had given to them by others.
U||   His first address was An humble Remonstrance by a dutiful son of the
U||   Church, almost as if he had said her whiteboy.—Milton, Prose Works,
U||   vol. i. p. 172.
U||   [Pg 301]
U||   The Pope was loath to adventure his darlings into danger. Those
U||   whiteboys were to stay at home with his Holiness, their tender
U||   father.—Fuller, Holy War, i. 13.
U||   Wife. It is a very profound testimony, yielded by language, to the fact
U||   that women are intended to be wives, and only find the true completion
U||   of their being when they are so, that in so many languages there is a
U||   word which, meaning first a woman, means afterwards a wife, as γυνή,
U||   ‘mulier,’ ‘femme,’ ‘weib,’ and our English ‘wife.’ With us indeed the
U||   secondary use of the word has now overborne and swallowed up the first,
U||   which only survives in a few such combinations as ‘midwife,’
U||   ‘fishwife,’ ‘huswife,’ and the like; but it was not always so; nor in
U||   our provincial dialects is it so now. An intelligent correspondent who
U||   has sent me a ‘Glossary of Words used in Central Yorkshire’ writes as
U||   follows: ‘In rural districts a grown woman is a young wife, though she
U||   be unmarried.’
U||   And with that word upstart this olde wife.
U||   Chaucer, The Wife of Bath’s Tale.
U||   Like as a wife with childe, when hir travaile commeth upon her, is
U||   ashamed, crieth, and suffreth the payne, even so are we, O Lorde, in
U||   thy sight.—Isai. xxvi. 17. Coverdale.
U||   Wight. The best discussion on this interesting word is in Grimm’s
U||   Teutonic Mythology, pp. 439-442, who has a chapter [ch. xvii.], ‘On
U||   Wights and Elves.’ ‘Wight’ has for us lost altogether its original
U||   sense of a preternatural or supernatural being, and is used, but always
U||   slightingly, of men. It is easy to see how, with the gradual contempt
U||   for the old mythology,[Pg 302] the dying-out of the superstitions
U||   connected with it, words such as ‘elf’ and ‘wight’ should have lost
U||   their weight and honour as well.
U||   I crouche thee from elves and from wights.
U||   Chaucer, The Miller’s Tale.
U||   The poet Homer speaketh of no garlands and chaplets but due to the
U||   celestial and heavenly wights.—Holland, Pliny, vol. i. p. 456.
U||   A black horse cometh, and his rider hath a balance, and a voice telleth
U||   among the four wights that corn shall be dear [Rev. vi. 6].—Broughton,
U||   Of Consent upon Apocalypse.
U||   When the four wights are said to have given glory, honour, and thanks
U||   to Him that sate upon the throne [Rev. v. 14], what was their ditty but
U||   this?—Mede, Sermons.
U||   Wilful,   }
U||   Wilfully.
U||   ‘Wilful’ and ‘willing,’ ‘wilfully’ and ‘willingly,’ have been
U||   conveniently desynonymized by later usage in our language; so that in
U||   ‘wilful’ and ‘wilfully’ there now lies ever the sense of will
U||   capriciously exerted, deriving its motives merely from itself; while
U||   the examples which follow show there was once no such implication of
U||   self-will in the words.
U||   Alle the sones of Israel halewiden wilful thingis to the Lord.—Exod.
U||   xxxv. 29. Wiclif.
U||   A proud priest may be known when he denieth to follow Christ and his
U||   apostles in wilful poverty and other virtues.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs;
U||   Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   Fede ye the flok of God, that is among you, and purvey ye, not as
U||   constreyned, but wilfulli.—1 Pet. v. 2. Wiclif.
U||   And so, through his pitiful nailing, Christ shed out wilfully for man’s
U||   life the blood that was in his veins.—Foxe, Book of Martyrs;
U||   Examination of William Thorpe.
U||   [Pg 303]
U||   Wince. Now to shrink or start away as in pain from a stroke or touch;
U||   but, as far as I know, used always by our earlier authors in the sense
U||   of to kick.
U||   Poul, whom the Lord hadde chosun, long tyme wynside agen the
U||   pricke.—Wiclif, Prolog on the Dedis of Apostlis.
U||   For this flower of age, having no forecast of thrift, but set
U||   altogether upon spending, and given to delights and pleasures, winseth
U||   and flingeth out like a skittish and frampold horse in such sort that
U||   it had need of a sharp bit and short curb.—Holland, Plutarch’s Morals,
U||   p. 14.
U||   Wit,   }
U||   Witty.
U||   The present meaning of ‘wit’ as compared with the past, and the period
U||   when it was in the act of transition from one to the other, cannot be
U||   better marked than in the quotation from Bishop Reynolds which is given
U||   below. It is a protest, an impotent one, as such invariably are,
U||   against a change in the word’s meaning, going on before his eyes.
U||   Cowley’s Ode, Of Wit, is another very important document, illustrating
U||   the history of the word.
U||   Who knew the wit of the Lord, or who was his counselour?—Rom. xi. 34.
U||   Wiclif.
U||   I take not wit in that common acceptation, whereby men understand some
U||   sudden flashes of conceit whether in style or conference, which, like
U||   rotten wood in the dark, have more shine than substance, whose use and
U||   ornament are, like themselves, swift and vanishing, at once both
U||   admired and forgotten. But I understand a settled, constant, and
U||   habitual sufficiency of the understanding, whereby it is enabled in any
U||   kind of learning, theory, or practice, both to sharpness in search,
U||   subtilty in expression, and despatch in execution.—Reynolds, Passions
U||   and Faculties of the Soul, c. xxxix.
U||   [Pg 304]
U||   For the world laghes on man and smyles,
U||   Bot at the last it him bygyles;
U||   Tharfor I hald that man noght witty
U||   That about the world is over bysy.
U||   Richard Rolle de Hampole, Pricke of Conscience, 1092.
U||   I confess notwithstanding, with the wittiest of the school divines,
U||   that if we speak of strict justice God could no way have been bound to
U||   requite man’s labours in so large and ample manner.—Hooker,
U||   Ecclesiastical Polity, b. i. c. 11.
U||   Witch. This was not restrained formerly, as it now is, to the female
U||   exerciser of unlawful magical arts, but would have been as freely
U||   applied to Balaam or Simon Magus as to her whom we call ‘the Witch of
U||   Endor.’ ‘She-witch’ was not uncommon in our Elizabethan literature,
U||   when such was intended. In the dialect of Northumbria ‘witches’ are of
U||   both sexes still (Atkinson).
U||   There was a man in that citee whos name was Symount, a witche.—Acts
U||   viii. 9. Wiclif.
U||   Item, he is a witch, asking counsel at soothsayers.—Foxe, Book of
U||   Martyrs; Appeal against Boniface.
U||   Then the king commanded to call together all the soothsayers, charmers,
U||   witches, and Caldees, for to shew the king his dream.—Dan. ii. 2.
U||   Coverdale.
U||   Who can deny him a wisard or witch, who in the reign of Richard the
U||   Usurper foretold that upon the same stone where he dashed his spur
U||   riding toward Bosworth field he should dash his head in his
U||   return?—Cotta, The Trial of Witchcraft, p. 49.
U||   Wizard. A title not necessarily used in times past with any
U||   dishonourable subaudition of perverted wisdom on his part to whom it
U||   was given, as is now the case.
U||   [Pg 305]
U||   Then Herod, calling the wisards privily, did narrowly search of them
U||   the time of the star’s appearing.—Matt. ii. 7. Sir J. Cheke.
U||   When Jeremy his lamentation writ,
U||   They thought the wizard quite out of his wit.
U||   Drayton, Elegies, To Mr. G. Sandys.
