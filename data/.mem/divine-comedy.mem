U||HELL
U||OR THE INFERNO
U||CANTO I
U||In the midway of this our mortal life,
U||I found me in a gloomy wood, astray
U||Gone from the path direct: and e’en to tell
U||It were no easy task, how savage wild
U||That forest, how robust and rough its growth,
U||Which to remember only, my dismay
U||Renews, in bitterness not far from death.
U||Yet to discourse of what there good befell,
U||All else will I relate discover’d there.
U||How first I enter’d it I scarce can say,
U||Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh’d
U||My senses down, when the true path I left,
U||But when a mountain’s foot I reach’d, where clos’d
U||The valley, that had pierc’d my heart with dread,
U||I look’d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad
U||Already vested with that planet’s beam,
U||Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.
U||Then was a little respite to the fear,
U||That in my heart’s recesses deep had lain,
U||All of that night, so pitifully pass’d:
U||And as a man, with difficult short breath,
U||Forespent with toiling, ’scap’d from sea to shore,
U||Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands
U||At gaze; e’en so my spirit, that yet fail’d
U||Struggling with terror, turn’d to view the straits,
U||That none hath pass’d and liv’d. My weary frame
U||After short pause recomforted, again
U||I journey’d on over that lonely steep,
U||The hinder foot still firmer. Scarce the ascent
U||Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,
U||And cover’d with a speckled skin, appear’d,
U||Nor, when it saw me, vanish’d, rather strove
U||To check my onward going; that ofttimes
U||With purpose to retrace my steps I turn’d.
U||The hour was morning’s prime, and on his way
U||Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,
U||That with him rose, when Love divine first mov’d
U||Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope
U||All things conspir’d to fill me, the gay skin
U||Of that swift animal, the matin dawn
U||And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chas’d,
U||And by new dread succeeded, when in view
U||A lion came, ’gainst me, as it appear’d,
U||With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,
U||That e’en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf
U||Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem’d
U||Full of all wants, and many a land hath made
U||Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear
U||O’erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall’d,
U||That of the height all hope I lost. As one,
U||Who with his gain elated, sees the time
U||When all unwares is gone, he inwardly
U||Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,
U||Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,
U||Who coming o’er against me, by degrees
U||Impell’d me where the sun in silence rests.
U||While to the lower space with backward step
U||I fell, my ken discern’d the form one of one,
U||Whose voice seem’d faint through long disuse of speech.
U||When him in that great desert I espied,
U||“Have mercy on me!” cried I out aloud,
U||“Spirit! or living man! what e’er thou be!”
U||He answer’d: “Now not man, man once I was,
U||And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both
U||By country, when the power of Julius yet
U||Was scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past
U||Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time
U||Of fabled deities and false. A bard
U||Was I, and made Anchises’ upright son
U||The subject of my song, who came from Troy,
U||When the flames prey’d on Ilium’s haughty towers.
U||But thou, say wherefore to such perils past
U||Return’st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount
U||Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?”
U||“And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,
U||From which such copious floods of eloquence
U||Have issued?” I with front abash’d replied.
U||“Glory and light of all the tuneful train!
U||May it avail me that I long with zeal
U||Have sought thy volume, and with love immense
U||Have conn’d it o’er. My master thou and guide!
U||Thou he from whom alone I have deriv’d
U||That style, which for its beauty into fame
U||Exalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled.
U||O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!
U||“For every vein and pulse throughout my frame
U||She hath made tremble.” He, soon as he saw
U||That I was weeping, answer’d, “Thou must needs
U||Another way pursue, if thou wouldst ’scape
U||From out that savage wilderness. This beast,
U||At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none
U||To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:
U||So bad and so accursed in her kind,
U||That never sated is her ravenous will,
U||Still after food more craving than before.
U||To many an animal in wedlock vile
U||She fastens, and shall yet to many more,
U||Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy
U||Her with sharp pain. He will not life support
U||By earth nor its base metals, but by love,
U||Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be
U||The land ’twixt either Feltro. In his might
U||Shall safety to Italia’s plains arise,
U||For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,
U||Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.
U||He with incessant chase through every town
U||Shall worry, until he to hell at length
U||Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.
U||I for thy profit pond’ring now devise,
U||That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide
U||Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,
U||Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see
U||Spirits of old tormented, who invoke
U||A second death; and those next view, who dwell
U||Content in fire, for that they hope to come,
U||Whene’er the time may be, among the blest,
U||Into whose regions if thou then desire
U||T’ ascend, a spirit worthier than I
U||Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,
U||Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,
U||Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,
U||Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,
U||That to his city none through me should come.
U||He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds
U||His citadel and throne. O happy those,
U||Whom there he chooses!” I to him in few:
U||“Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,
U||I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse
U||I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,
U||That I Saint Peter’s gate may view, and those
U||Who as thou tell’st, are in such dismal plight.”
U||Onward he mov’d, I close his steps pursu’d.
U||CANTO II
U||Now was the day departing, and the air,
U||Imbrown’d with shadows, from their toils releas’d
U||All animals on earth; and I alone
U||Prepar’d myself the conflict to sustain,
U||Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,
U||Which my unerring memory shall retrace.
U||O Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe
U||Your aid! O mind! that all I saw hast kept
U||Safe in a written record, here thy worth
U||And eminent endowments come to proof.
U||I thus began: “Bard! thou who art my guide,
U||Consider well, if virtue be in me
U||Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise
U||Thou trust me. Thou hast told that Silvius’ sire,
U||Yet cloth’d in corruptible flesh, among
U||Th’ immortal tribes had entrance, and was there
U||Sensible present. Yet if heaven’s great Lord,
U||Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew’d,
U||In contemplation of the high effect,
U||Both what and who from him should issue forth,
U||It seems in reason’s judgment well deserv’d:
U||Sith he of Rome, and of Rome’s empire wide,
U||In heaven’s empyreal height was chosen sire:
U||Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain’d
U||And ’stablish’d for the holy place, where sits
U||Who to great Peter’s sacred chair succeeds.
U||He from this journey, in thy song renown’d,
U||Learn’d things, that to his victory gave rise
U||And to the papal robe. In after-times
U||The chosen vessel also travel’d there,
U||To bring us back assurance in that faith,
U||Which is the entrance to salvation’s way.
U||But I, why should I there presume? or who
U||Permits it? not Aeneas I nor Paul.
U||Myself I deem not worthy, and none else
U||Will deem me. I, if on this voyage then
U||I venture, fear it will in folly end.
U||Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know’st,
U||Than I can speak.” As one, who unresolves
U||What he hath late resolv’d, and with new thoughts
U||Changes his purpose, from his first intent
U||Remov’d; e’en such was I on that dun coast,
U||Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first
U||So eagerly embrac’d. “If right thy words
U||I scan,” replied that shade magnanimous,
U||“Thy soul is by vile fear assail’d, which oft
U||So overcasts a man, that he recoils
U||From noblest resolution, like a beast
U||At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.
U||That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,
U||I will instruct thee why I came, and what
U||I heard in that same instant, when for thee
U||Grief touch’d me first. I was among the tribe,
U||Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest
U||And lovely, I besought her to command,
U||Call’d me; her eyes were brighter than the star
U||Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft
U||Angelically tun’d her speech address’d:
U||“O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame
U||Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!
U||A friend, not of my fortune but myself,
U||On the wide desert in his road has met
U||Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn’d.
U||Now much I dread lest he past help have stray’d,
U||And I be ris’n too late for his relief,
U||From what in heaven of him I heard. Speed now,
U||And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,
U||And by all means for his deliverance meet,
U||Assist him. So to me will comfort spring.
U||I who now bid thee on this errand forth
U||Am Beatrice; from a place I come.
U||(Note: Beatrice. I use this word, as it is
U||pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four
U||syllables, of which the third is a long one.) Revisited with joy. Love brought me thence,
U||Who prompts my speech. When in my Master’s sight
U||I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.”
U||She then was silent, and I thus began:
U||“O Lady! by whose influence alone,
U||Mankind excels whatever is contain’d
U||Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,
U||So thy command delights me, that to obey,
U||If it were done already, would seem late.
U||No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;
U||Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth
U||To leave that ample space, where to return
U||Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.”
U||She then: “Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,
U||I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread
U||Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone
U||Are to be fear’d, whence evil may proceed,
U||None else, for none are terrible beside.
U||I am so fram’d by God, thanks to his grace!
U||That any suff’rance of your misery
U||Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire
U||Assails me. In high heaven a blessed dame
U||Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief
U||That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,
U||That God’s stern judgment to her will inclines.”
U||To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:
U||“Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
U||And I commend him to thee.” At her word
U||Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,
U||And coming to the place, where I abode
U||Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,
U||She thus address’d me: “Thou true praise of God!
U||Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent
U||To him, who so much lov’d thee, as to leave
U||For thy sake all the multitude admires?
U||Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,
U||Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,
U||Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?”
U||Ne’er among men did any with such speed
U||Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,
U||As when these words were spoken, I came here,
U||Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force
U||Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all
U||Who well have mark’d it, into honour brings.”
U||“When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes
U||Tearful she turn’d aside; whereat I felt
U||Redoubled zeal to serve thee. As she will’d,
U||Thus am I come: I sav’d thee from the beast,
U||Who thy near way across the goodly mount
U||Prevented. What is this comes o’er thee then?
U||Why, why dost thou hang back? why in thy breast
U||Harbour vile fear? why hast not courage there
U||And noble daring? Since three maids so blest
U||Thy safety plan, e’en in the court of heaven;
U||And so much certain good my words forebode.”
U||As florets, by the frosty air of night
U||Bent down and clos’d, when day has blanch’d their leaves,
U||Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;
U||So was my fainting vigour new restor’d,
U||And to my heart such kindly courage ran,
U||That I as one undaunted soon replied:
U||“O full of pity she, who undertook
U||My succour! and thou kind who didst perform
U||So soon her true behest! With such desire
U||Thou hast dispos’d me to renew my voyage,
U||That my first purpose fully is resum’d.
U||Lead on: one only will is in us both.
U||Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.”
U||So spake I; and when he had onward mov’d,
U||I enter’d on the deep and woody way.
U||CANTO III
U||“Through me you pass into the city of woe:
U||Through me you pass into eternal pain:
U||Through me among the people lost for aye.
U||Justice the founder of my fabric mov’d:
U||To rear me was the task of power divine,
U||Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.
U||Before me things create were none, save things
U||Eternal, and eternal I endure.
U||“All hope abandon ye who enter here.”
U||Such characters in colour dim I mark’d
U||Over a portal’s lofty arch inscrib’d:
U||Whereat I thus: “Master, these words import
U||Hard meaning.” He as one prepar’d replied:
U||“Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;
U||Here be vile fear extinguish’d. We are come
U||Where I have told thee we shall see the souls
U||To misery doom’d, who intellectual good
U||Have lost.” And when his hand he had stretch’d forth
U||To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer’d,
U||Into that secret place he led me on.
U||Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans
U||Resounded through the air pierc’d by no star,
U||That e’en I wept at entering. Various tongues,
U||Horrible languages, outcries of woe,
U||Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,
U||With hands together smote that swell’d the sounds,
U||Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls
U||Round through that air with solid darkness stain’d,
U||Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.
U||I then, with error yet encompass’d, cried:
U||“O master! What is this I hear? What race
U||Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?”
U||He thus to me: “This miserable fate
U||Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv’d
U||Without or praise or blame, with that ill band
U||Of angels mix’d, who nor rebellious prov’d
U||Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves
U||Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,
U||Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth
U||Of Hell receives them, lest th’ accursed tribe
U||Should glory thence with exultation vain.”
U||I then: “Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,
U||That they lament so loud?” He straight replied:
U||“That will I tell thee briefly. These of death
U||No hope may entertain: and their blind life
U||So meanly passes, that all other lots
U||They envy. Fame of them the world hath none,
U||Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.
U||Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.”
U||And I, who straightway look’d, beheld a flag,
U||Which whirling ran around so rapidly,
U||That it no pause obtain’d: and following came
U||Such a long train of spirits, I should ne’er
U||Have thought, that death so many had despoil’d.
U||When some of these I recogniz’d, I saw
U||And knew the shade of him, who to base fear
U||Yielding, abjur’d his high estate. Forthwith
U||I understood for certain this the tribe
U||Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing
U||And to his foes. These wretches, who ne’er lived,
U||Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung
U||By wasps and hornets, which bedew’d their cheeks
U||With blood, that mix’d with tears dropp’d to their feet,
U||And by disgustful worms was gather’d there.
U||Then looking farther onwards I beheld
U||A throng upon the shore of a great stream:
U||Whereat I thus: “Sir! grant me now to know
U||Whom here we view, and whence impell’d they seem
U||So eager to pass o’er, as I discern
U||Through the blear light?” He thus to me in few:
U||“This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive
U||Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.”
U||Then with eyes downward cast and fill’d with shame,
U||Fearing my words offensive to his ear,
U||Till we had reach’d the river, I from speech
U||Abstain’d. And lo! toward us in a bark
U||Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,
U||Crying, “Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not
U||Ever to see the sky again. I come
U||To take you to the other shore across,
U||Into eternal darkness, there to dwell
U||In fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there
U||Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave
U||These who are dead.” But soon as he beheld
U||I left them not, “By other way,” said he,
U||“By other haven shalt thou come to shore,
U||Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat
U||Must carry.” Then to him thus spake my guide:
U||“Charon! thyself torment not: so ’t is will’d,
U||Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.”
U||Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
U||Of him the boatman o’er the livid lake,
U||Around whose eyes glar’d wheeling flames. Meanwhile
U||Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang’d,
U||And gnash’d their teeth, soon as the cruel words
U||They heard. God and their parents they blasphem’d,
U||The human kind, the place, the time, and seed
U||That did engender them and give them birth.
U||Then all together sorely wailing drew
U||To the curs’d strand, that every man must pass
U||Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form,
U||With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,
U||Beck’ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar
U||Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves,
U||One still another following, till the bough
U||Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;
U||E’en in like manner Adam’s evil brood
U||Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,
U||Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.
U||Thus go they over through the umber’d wave,
U||And ever they on the opposing bank
U||Be landed, on this side another throng
U||Still gathers. “Son,” thus spake the courteous guide,
U||“Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,
U||All here together come from every clime,
U||And to o’erpass the river are not loth:
U||For so heaven’s justice goads them on, that fear
U||Is turn’d into desire. Hence ne’er hath past
U||Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain,
U||Now mayst thou know the import of his words.”
U||This said, the gloomy region trembling shook
U||So terribly, that yet with clammy dews
U||Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast,
U||That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,
U||Which all my senses conquer’d quite, and I
U||Down dropp’d, as one with sudden slumber seiz’d.
U||CANTO IV
U||Broke the deep slumber in my brain a crash
U||Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,
U||As one by main force rous’d. Risen upright,
U||My rested eyes I mov’d around, and search’d
U||With fixed ken to know what place it was,
U||Wherein I stood. For certain on the brink
U||I found me of the lamentable vale,
U||The dread abyss, that joins a thund’rous sound
U||Of plaints innumerable. Dark and deep,
U||And thick with clouds o’erspread, mine eye in vain
U||Explor’d its bottom, nor could aught discern.
U||“Now let us to the blind world there beneath
U||Descend;” the bard began all pale of look:
U||“I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.”
U||Then I his alter’d hue perceiving, thus:
U||“How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,
U||Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?”
U||He then: “The anguish of that race below
U||With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear
U||Mistakest. Let us on. Our length of way
U||Urges to haste.” Onward, this said, he mov’d;
U||And ent’ring led me with him on the bounds
U||Of the first circle, that surrounds th’ abyss.
U||Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard
U||Except of sighs, that made th’ eternal air
U||Tremble, not caus’d by tortures, but from grief
U||Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,
U||Of men, women, and infants. Then to me
U||The gentle guide: “Inquir’st thou not what spirits
U||Are these, which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass
U||Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin
U||Were blameless; and if aught they merited,
U||It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,
U||The portal to thy faith. If they before
U||The Gospel liv’d, they serv’d not God aright;
U||And among such am I. For these defects,
U||And for no other evil, we are lost;
U||“Only so far afflicted, that we live
U||Desiring without hope.” So grief assail’d
U||My heart at hearing this, for well I knew
U||Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
U||Of mighty worth. “O tell me, sire rever’d!
U||Tell me, my master!” I began through wish
U||Of full assurance in that holy faith,
U||Which vanquishes all error; “say, did e’er
U||Any, or through his own or other’s merit,
U||Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?”
U||Piercing the secret purport of my speech,
U||He answer’d: “I was new to that estate,
U||When I beheld a puissant one arrive
U||Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown’d.
U||He forth the shade of our first parent drew,
U||Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,
U||Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv’d,
U||Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,
U||Israel with his sire and with his sons,
U||Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,
U||And others many more, whom he to bliss
U||Exalted. Before these, be thou assur’d,
U||No spirit of human kind was ever sav’d.”
U||We, while he spake, ceas’d not our onward road,
U||Still passing through the wood; for so I name
U||Those spirits thick beset. We were not far
U||On this side from the summit, when I kenn’d
U||A flame, that o’er the darken’d hemisphere
U||Prevailing shin’d. Yet we a little space
U||Were distant, not so far but I in part
U||Discover’d, that a tribe in honour high
U||That place possess’d. “O thou, who every art
U||And science valu’st! who are these, that boast
U||Such honour, separate from all the rest?”
U||He answer’d: “The renown of their great names
U||That echoes through your world above, acquires
U||Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc’d.”
U||Meantime a voice I heard: “Honour the bard
U||Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!”
U||No sooner ceas’d the sound, than I beheld
U||Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,
U||Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.
U||When thus my master kind began: “Mark him,
U||Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,
U||The other three preceding, as their lord.
U||This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:
U||Flaccus the next in satire’s vein excelling;
U||The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.
U||Because they all that appellation own,
U||With which the voice singly accosted me,
U||Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.”
U||So I beheld united the bright school
U||Of him the monarch of sublimest song,
U||That o’er the others like an eagle soars.
U||When they together short discourse had held,
U||They turn’d to me, with salutation kind
U||Beck’ning me; at the which my master smil’d:
U||Nor was this all; but greater honour still
U||They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;
U||And I was sixth amid so learn’d a band.
U||Far as the luminous beacon on we pass’d
U||Speaking of matters, then befitting well
U||To speak, now fitter left untold. At foot
U||Of a magnificent castle we arriv’d,
U||Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round
U||Defended by a pleasant stream. O’er this
U||As o’er dry land we pass’d. Next through seven gates
U||I with those sages enter’d, and we came
U||Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.
U||There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around
U||Majestically mov’d, and in their port
U||Bore eminent authority; they spake
U||Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.
U||We to one side retir’d, into a place
U||Open and bright and lofty, whence each one
U||Stood manifest to view. Incontinent
U||There on the green enamel of the plain
U||Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight
U||I am exalted in my own esteem.
U||Electra there I saw accompanied
U||By many, among whom Hector I knew,
U||Anchises’ pious son, and with hawk’s eye
U||Caesar all arm’d, and by Camilla there
U||Penthesilea. On the other side
U||Old King Latinus, seated by his child
U||Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,
U||Who Tarquin chas’d, Lucretia, Cato’s wife
U||Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;
U||And sole apart retir’d, the Soldan fierce.
U||Then when a little more I rais’d my brow,
U||I spied the master of the sapient throng,
U||Seated amid the philosophic train.
U||Him all admire, all pay him rev’rence due.
U||There Socrates and Plato both I mark’d,
U||Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,
U||Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,
U||With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,
U||And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,
U||Zeno, and Dioscorides well read
U||In nature’s secret lore. Orpheus I mark’d
U||And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,
U||Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,
U||Galenus, Avicen, and him who made
U||That commentary vast, Averroes.
U||Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;
U||For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes
U||My words fall short of what bechanc’d. In two
U||The six associates part. Another way
U||My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,
U||Into a climate ever vex’d with storms:
U||And to a part I come where no light shines.
U||CANTO V
U||From the first circle I descended thus
U||Down to the second, which, a lesser space
U||Embracing, so much more of grief contains
U||Provoking bitter moans. There, Minos stands
U||Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all
U||Who enter, strict examining the crimes,
U||Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,
U||According as he foldeth him around:
U||For when before him comes th’ ill fated soul,
U||It all confesses; and that judge severe
U||Of sins, considering what place in hell
U||Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft
U||Himself encircles, as degrees beneath
U||He dooms it to descend. Before him stand
U||Always a num’rous throng; and in his turn
U||Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears
U||His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl’d.
U||“O thou! who to this residence of woe
U||Approachest?” when he saw me coming, cried
U||Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,
U||“Look how thou enter here; beware in whom
U||Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad
U||Deceive thee to thy harm.” To him my guide:
U||“Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder not his way
U||By destiny appointed; so ’tis will’d
U||Where will and power are one. Ask thou no more.”
U||Now ’gin the rueful wailings to be heard.
U||Now am I come where many a plaining voice
U||Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came
U||Where light was silent all. Bellowing there groan’d
U||A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
U||By warring winds. The stormy blast of hell
U||With restless fury drives the spirits on
U||Whirl’d round and dash’d amain with sore annoy.
U||When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,
U||There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,
U||And blasphemies ’gainst the good Power in heaven.
U||I understood that to this torment sad
U||The carnal sinners are condemn’d, in whom
U||Reason by lust is sway’d. As in large troops
U||And multitudinous, when winter reigns,
U||The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;
U||So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.
U||On this side and on that, above, below,
U||It drives them: hope of rest to solace them
U||Is none, nor e’en of milder pang. As cranes,
U||Chanting their dol’rous notes, traverse the sky,
U||Stretch’d out in long array: so I beheld
U||Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on
U||By their dire doom. Then I: “Instructor! who
U||Are these, by the black air so scourg’d?”—“The first
U||’Mong those, of whom thou question’st,” he replied,
U||“O’er many tongues was empress. She in vice
U||Of luxury was so shameless, that she made
U||Liking be lawful by promulg’d decree,
U||To clear the blame she had herself incurr’d.
U||This is Semiramis, of whom ’tis writ,
U||That she succeeded Ninus her espous’d;
U||And held the land, which now the Soldan rules.
U||The next in amorous fury slew herself,
U||And to Sicheus’ ashes broke her faith:
U||Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.”
U||There mark’d I Helen, for whose sake so long
U||The time was fraught with evil; there the great
U||Achilles, who with love fought to the end.
U||Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside
U||A thousand more he show’d me, and by name
U||Pointed them out, whom love bereav’d of life.
U||When I had heard my sage instructor name
U||Those dames and knights of antique days, o’erpower’d
U||By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind
U||Was lost; and I began: “Bard! willingly
U||I would address those two together coming,
U||Which seem so light before the wind.” He thus:
U||“Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.
U||“Then by that love which carries them along,
U||Entreat; and they will come.” Soon as the wind
U||Sway’d them toward us, I thus fram’d my speech:
U||“O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse
U||With us, if by none else restrain’d.” As doves
U||By fond desire invited, on wide wings
U||And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,
U||Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;
U||Thus issu’d from that troop, where Dido ranks,
U||They through the ill air speeding; with such force
U||My cry prevail’d by strong affection urg’d.
U||“O gracious creature and benign! who go’st
U||Visiting, through this element obscure,
U||Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru’d;
U||If for a friend the King of all we own’d,
U||Our pray’r to him should for thy peace arise,
U||Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.
U||Of whatsoe’er to hear or to discourse
U||It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that
U||Freely with thee discourse, while e’er the wind,
U||As now, is mute. The land, that gave me birth,
U||Is situate on the coast, where Po descends
U||To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.
U||“Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,
U||Entangled him by that fair form, from me
U||Ta’en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:
U||Love, that denial takes from none belov’d,
U||Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,
U||That, as thou see’st, he yet deserts me not.
U||“Love brought us to one death: Caina waits
U||The soul, who spilt our life.” Such were their words;
U||At hearing which downward I bent my looks,
U||And held them there so long, that the bard cried:
U||“What art thou pond’ring?” I in answer thus:
U||“Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire
U||Must they at length to that ill pass have reach’d!”
U||Then turning, I to them my speech address’d.
U||And thus began: “Francesca! your sad fate
U||Even to tears my grief and pity moves.
U||But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,
U||By what, and how love granted, that ye knew
U||Your yet uncertain wishes?” She replied:
U||“No greater grief than to remember days
U||Of joy, when mis’ry is at hand! That kens
U||Thy learn’d instructor. Yet so eagerly
U||If thou art bent to know the primal root,
U||From whence our love gat being, I will do,
U||As one, who weeps and tells his tale. One day
U||For our delight we read of Lancelot,
U||How him love thrall’d. Alone we were, and no
U||Suspicion near us. Ofttimes by that reading
U||Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue
U||Fled from our alter’d cheek. But at one point
U||Alone we fell. When of that smile we read,
U||The wished smile, rapturously kiss’d
U||By one so deep in love, then he, who ne’er
U||From me shall separate, at once my lips
U||All trembling kiss’d. The book and writer both
U||Were love’s purveyors. In its leaves that day
U||We read no more.” While thus one spirit spake,
U||The other wail’d so sorely, that heartstruck
U||I through compassion fainting, seem’d not far
U||From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.
U||CANTO VI
U||My sense reviving, that erewhile had droop’d
U||With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief
U||O’ercame me wholly, straight around I see
U||New torments, new tormented souls, which way
U||Soe’er I move, or turn, or bend my sight.
U||In the third circle I arrive, of show’rs
U||Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang’d
U||For ever, both in kind and in degree.
U||Large hail, discolour’d water, sleety flaw
U||Through the dun midnight air stream’d down amain:
U||Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.
U||Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,
U||Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog
U||Over the multitude immers’d beneath.
U||His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,
U||His belly large, and claw’d the hands, with which
U||He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs
U||Piecemeal disparts. Howling there spread, as curs,
U||Under the rainy deluge, with one side
U||The other screening, oft they roll them round,
U||A wretched, godless crew. When that great worm
U||Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op’d
U||His jaws, and the fangs show’d us; not a limb
U||Of him but trembled. Then my guide, his palms
U||Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth
U||Rais’d them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.
U||E’en as a dog, that yelling bays for food
U||His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall
U||His fury, bent alone with eager haste
U||To swallow it; so dropp’d the loathsome cheeks
U||Of demon Cerberus, who thund’ring stuns
U||The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.
U||We, o’er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt
U||Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet
U||Upon their emptiness, that substance seem’d.
U||They all along the earth extended lay
U||Save one, that sudden rais’d himself to sit,
U||Soon as that way he saw us pass. “O thou!”
U||He cried, “who through the infernal shades art led,
U||Own, if again thou know’st me. Thou wast fram’d
U||Or ere my frame was broken.” I replied:
U||“The anguish thou endur’st perchance so takes
U||Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems
U||As if I saw thee never. But inform
U||Me who thou art, that in a place so sad
U||Art set, and in such torment, that although
U||Other be greater, more disgustful none
U||Can be imagin’d.” He in answer thus:
U||“Thy city heap’d with envy to the brim,
U||Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,
U||Held me in brighter days. Ye citizens
U||Were wont to name me Ciacco. For the sin
U||Of glutt’ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,
U||E’en as thou see’st, I with fatigue am worn;
U||Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these
U||Have by like crime incurr’d like punishment.”
U||No more he said, and I my speech resum’d:
U||“Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,
U||Even to tears. But tell me, if thou know’st,
U||What shall at length befall the citizens
U||Of the divided city; whether any just one
U||Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,
U||Whence jarring discord hath assail’d it thus?”
U||He then: “After long striving they will come
U||To blood; and the wild party from the woods
U||Will chase the other with much injury forth.
U||Then it behoves, that this must fall, within
U||Three solar circles; and the other rise
U||By borrow’d force of one, who under shore
U||Now rests. It shall a long space hold aloof
U||Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight
U||The other oppress’d, indignant at the load,
U||And grieving sore. The just are two in number,
U||But they neglected. Av’rice, envy, pride,
U||Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all
U||On fire.” Here ceas’d the lamentable sound;
U||And I continu’d thus: “Still would I learn
U||More from thee, farther parley still entreat.
U||Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,
U||They who so well deserv’d, of Giacopo,
U||Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent
U||Their minds on working good. Oh! tell me where
U||They bide, and to their knowledge let me come.
U||For I am press’d with keen desire to hear,
U||If heaven’s sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell
U||Be to their lip assign’d.” He answer’d straight:
U||“These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes
U||Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.
U||If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.
U||But to the pleasant world when thou return’st,
U||Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there.
U||No more I tell thee, answer thee no more.”
U||This said, his fixed eyes he turn’d askance,
U||A little ey’d me, then bent down his head,
U||And ’midst his blind companions with it fell.
U||When thus my guide: “No more his bed he leaves,
U||Ere the last angel-trumpet blow. The Power
U||Adverse to these shall then in glory come,
U||Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,
U||Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,
U||And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend
U||The vault.” So pass’d we through that mixture foul
U||Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile
U||Touching, though slightly, on the life to come.
U||For thus I question’d: “Shall these tortures, Sir!
U||When the great sentence passes, be increas’d,
U||Or mitigated, or as now severe?”
U||He then: “Consult thy knowledge; that decides
U||That as each thing to more perfection grows,
U||It feels more sensibly both good and pain.
U||Though ne’er to true perfection may arrive
U||This race accurs’d, yet nearer then than now
U||They shall approach it.” Compassing that path
U||Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse
U||Much more than I relate between us pass’d:
U||Till at the point, where the steps led below,
U||Arriv’d, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.
U||CANTO VII
U||“Ah me! O Satan! Satan!” loud exclaim’d
U||Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:
U||And the kind sage, whom no event surpris’d,
U||To comfort me thus spake: “Let not thy fear
U||Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none
U||To hinder down this rock thy safe descent.”
U||Then to that sworn lip turning, “Peace!” he cried,
U||“Curs’d wolf! thy fury inward on thyself
U||Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound
U||Not without cause he passes. So ’t is will’d
U||On high, there where the great Archangel pour’d
U||Heav’n’s vengeance on the first adulterer proud.”
U||As sails full spread and bellying with the wind
U||Drop suddenly collaps’d, if the mast split;
U||So to the ground down dropp’d the cruel fiend.
U||Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,
U||Gain’d on the dismal shore, that all the woe
U||Hems in of all the universe. Ah me!
U||Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap’st
U||New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!
U||Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?
U||E’en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,
U||Against encounter’d billow dashing breaks;
U||Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,
U||Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,
U||From one side and the other, with loud voice,
U||Both roll’d on weights by main forge of their breasts,
U||Then smote together, and each one forthwith
U||Roll’d them back voluble, turning again,
U||Exclaiming these, “Why holdest thou so fast?”
U||Those answering, “And why castest thou away?”
U||So still repeating their despiteful song,
U||They to the opposite point on either hand
U||Travers’d the horrid circle: then arriv’d,
U||Both turn’d them round, and through the middle space
U||Conflicting met again. At sight whereof
U||I, stung with grief, thus spake: “O say, my guide!
U||What race is this? Were these, whose heads are shorn,
U||On our left hand, all sep’rate to the church?”
U||He straight replied: “In their first life these all
U||In mind were so distorted, that they made,
U||According to due measure, of their wealth,
U||No use. This clearly from their words collect,
U||Which they howl forth, at each extremity
U||Arriving of the circle, where their crime
U||Contrary in kind disparts them. To the church
U||Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls
U||Are crown’d, both Popes and Cardinals, o’er whom
U||Av’rice dominion absolute maintains.”
U||I then: “Mid such as these some needs must be,
U||Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot
U||Of these foul sins were stain’d.” He answering thus:
U||“Vain thought conceiv’st thou. That ignoble life,
U||Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,
U||And to all knowledge indiscernible.
U||Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:
U||These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,
U||Those with close-shaven locks. That ill they gave,
U||And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world
U||Depriv’d, and set them at this strife, which needs
U||No labour’d phrase of mine to set it off.
U||Now may’st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,
U||The goods committed into fortune’s hands,
U||For which the human race keep such a coil!
U||Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,
U||Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls
U||Might purchase rest for one.” I thus rejoin’d:
U||“My guide! of thee this also would I learn;
U||This fortune, that thou speak’st of, what it is,
U||Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?”
U||He thus: “O beings blind! what ignorance
U||Besets you? Now my judgment hear and mark.
U||He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,
U||The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers
U||To guide them, so that each part shines to each,
U||Their light in equal distribution pour’d.
U||By similar appointment he ordain’d
U||Over the world’s bright images to rule
U||Superintendence of a guiding hand
U||And general minister, which at due time
U||May change the empty vantages of life
U||From race to race, from one to other’s blood,
U||Beyond prevention of man’s wisest care:
U||Wherefore one nation rises into sway,
U||Another languishes, e’en as her will
U||Decrees, from us conceal’d, as in the grass
U||The serpent train. Against her nought avails
U||Your utmost wisdom. She with foresight plans,
U||Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs
U||The other powers divine. Her changes know
U||None intermission: by necessity
U||She is made swift, so frequent come who claim
U||Succession in her favours. This is she,
U||So execrated e’en by those, whose debt
U||To her is rather praise; they wrongfully
U||With blame requite her, and with evil word;
U||But she is blessed, and for that recks not:
U||Amidst the other primal beings glad
U||Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.
U||Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe
U||Descending: for each star is falling now,
U||That mounted at our entrance, and forbids
U||Too long our tarrying.” We the circle cross’d
U||To the next steep, arriving at a well,
U||That boiling pours itself down to a foss
U||Sluic’d from its source. Far murkier was the wave
U||Than sablest grain: and we in company
U||Of the inky waters, journeying by their side,
U||Enter’d, though by a different track, beneath.
U||Into a lake, the Stygian nam’d, expands
U||The dismal stream, when it hath reach’d the foot
U||Of the grey wither’d cliffs. Intent I stood
U||To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried
U||A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks
U||Betok’ning rage. They with their hands alone
U||Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,
U||Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.
U||The good instructor spake; “Now seest thou, son!
U||The souls of those, whom anger overcame.
U||This too for certain know, that underneath
U||The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs
U||Into these bubbles make the surface heave,
U||As thine eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turn.
U||Fix’d in the slime they say: ‘Sad once were we
U||In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,
U||Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:
U||Now in these murky settlings are we sad.’
U||Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.
U||But word distinct can utter none.” Our route
U||Thus compass’d we, a segment widely stretch’d
U||Between the dry embankment, and the core
U||Of the loath’d pool, turning meanwhile our eyes
U||Downward on those who gulp’d its muddy lees;
U||Nor stopp’d, till to a tower’s low base we came.
U||CANTO VIII
U||My theme pursuing, I relate that ere
U||We reach’d the lofty turret’s base, our eyes
U||Its height ascended, where two cressets hung
U||We mark’d, and from afar another light
U||Return the signal, so remote, that scarce
U||The eye could catch its beam. I turning round
U||To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir’d:
U||“Say what this means? and what that other light
U||In answer set? what agency doth this?”
U||“There on the filthy waters,” he replied,
U||“E’en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,
U||If the marsh-gender’d fog conceal it not.”
U||Never was arrow from the cord dismiss’d,
U||That ran its way so nimbly through the air,
U||As a small bark, that through the waves I spied
U||Toward us coming, under the sole sway
U||Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:
U||“Art thou arriv’d, fell spirit?”—“Phlegyas, Phlegyas,
U||This time thou criest in vain,” my lord replied;
U||“No longer shalt thou have us, but while o’er
U||The slimy pool we pass.” As one who hears
U||Of some great wrong he hath sustain’d, whereat
U||Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin’d
U||In his fierce ire. My guide descending stepp’d
U||Into the skiff, and bade me enter next
U||Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem’d
U||The vessel freighted. Soon as both embark’d,
U||Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,
U||More deeply than with others it is wont.
U||While we our course o’er the dead channel held.
U||One drench’d in mire before me came, and said;
U||“Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?”
U||I answer’d: “Though I come, I tarry not;
U||But who art thou, that art become so foul?”
U||“One, as thou seest, who mourn:” he straight replied.
U||To which I thus: “In mourning and in woe,
U||Curs’d spirit! tarry thou. I know thee well,
U||E’en thus in filth disguis’d.” Then stretch’d he forth
U||Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage
U||Aware, thrusting him back: “Away! down there,
U||“To the other dogs!” then, with his arms my neck
U||Encircling, kiss’d my cheek, and spake: “O soul
U||Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom
U||Thou was conceiv’d! He in the world was one
U||For arrogance noted; to his memory
U||No virtue lends its lustre; even so
U||Here is his shadow furious. There above
U||How many now hold themselves mighty kings
U||Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,
U||Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!”
U||I then: “Master! him fain would I behold
U||Whelm’d in these dregs, before we quit the lake.”
U||He thus: “Or ever to thy view the shore
U||Be offer’d, satisfied shall be that wish,
U||Which well deserves completion.” Scarce his words
U||Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes
U||Set on him with such violence, that yet
U||For that render I thanks to God and praise
U||“To Filippo Argenti:” cried they all:
U||And on himself the moody Florentine
U||Turn’d his avenging fangs. Him here we left,
U||Nor speak I of him more. But on mine ear
U||Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,
U||Whereat mine eye unbarr’d I sent abroad.
U||And thus the good instructor: “Now, my son!
U||Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam’d,
U||With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.”
U||I thus: “The minarets already, Sir!
U||There certes in the valley I descry,
U||Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire
U||Had issu’d.” He replied: “Eternal fire,
U||That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame
U||Illum’d; as in this nether hell thou seest.”
U||We came within the fosses deep, that moat
U||This region comfortless. The walls appear’d
U||As they were fram’d of iron. We had made
U||Wide circuit, ere a place we reach’d, where loud
U||The mariner cried vehement: “Go forth!
U||The entrance is here!” Upon the gates I spied
U||More than a thousand, who of old from heaven
U||Were hurl’d. With ireful gestures, “Who is this,”
U||They cried, “that without death first felt, goes through
U||The regions of the dead?” My sapient guide
U||Made sign that he for secret parley wish’d;
U||Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus
U||They spake: “Come thou alone; and let him go
U||Who hath so hardily enter’d this realm.
U||Alone return he by his witless way;
U||If well he know it, let him prove. For thee,
U||Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark
U||Hast been his escort.” Now bethink thee, reader!
U||What cheer was mine at sound of those curs’d words.
U||I did believe I never should return.
U||“O my lov’d guide! who more than seven times
U||Security hast render’d me, and drawn
U||From peril deep, whereto I stood expos’d,
U||Desert me not,” I cried, “in this extreme.
U||And if our onward going be denied,
U||Together trace we back our steps with speed.”
U||My liege, who thither had conducted me,
U||Replied: “Fear not: for of our passage none
U||Hath power to disappoint us, by such high
U||Authority permitted. But do thou
U||Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit
U||Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur’d
U||I will not leave thee in this lower world.”
U||This said, departs the sire benevolent,
U||And quits me. Hesitating I remain
U||At war ’twixt will and will not in my thoughts.
U||I could not hear what terms he offer’d them,
U||But they conferr’d not long, for all at once
U||To trial fled within. Clos’d were the gates
U||By those our adversaries on the breast
U||Of my liege lord: excluded he return’d
U||To me with tardy steps. Upon the ground
U||His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras’d
U||All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:
U||“Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?”
U||Then thus to me: “That I am anger’d, think
U||No ground of terror: in this trial I
U||Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within
U||For hindrance. This their insolence, not new,
U||Erewhile at gate less secret they display’d,
U||Which still is without bolt; upon its arch
U||Thou saw’st the deadly scroll: and even now
U||On this side of its entrance, down the steep,
U||Passing the circles, unescorted, comes
U||One whose strong might can open us this land.”
U||CANTO IX
U||The hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks
U||Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,
U||Chas’d that from his which newly they had worn,
U||And inwardly restrain’d it. He, as one
U||Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye
U||Not far could lead him through the sable air,
U||And the thick-gath’ring cloud. “It yet behooves
U||We win this fight”—thus he began—“if not—
U||Such aid to us is offer’d.—Oh, how long
U||Me seems it, ere the promis’d help arrive!”
U||I noted, how the sequel of his words
U||Clok’d their beginning; for the last he spake
U||Agreed not with the first. But not the less
U||My fear was at his saying; sith I drew
U||To import worse perchance, than that he held,
U||His mutilated speech. “Doth ever any
U||Into this rueful concave’s extreme depth
U||Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain
U||Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?”
U||Thus I inquiring. “Rarely,” he replied,
U||“It chances, that among us any makes
U||This journey, which I wend. Erewhile ’tis true
U||Once came I here beneath, conjur’d by fell
U||Erictho, sorceress, who compell’d the shades
U||Back to their bodies. No long space my flesh
U||Was naked of me, when within these walls
U||She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit
U||From out of Judas’ circle. Lowest place
U||Is that of all, obscurest, and remov’d
U||Farthest from heav’n’s all-circling orb. The road
U||Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.
U||That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round
U||The city’ of grief encompasses, which now
U||We may not enter without rage.” Yet more
U||He added: but I hold it not in mind,
U||For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
U||Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top.
U||Where in an instant I beheld uprisen
U||At once three hellish furies stain’d with blood:
U||In limb and motion feminine they seem’d;
U||Around them greenest hydras twisting roll’d
U||Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept
U||Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.
U||He knowing well the miserable hags
U||Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:
U||“Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left
U||This is Megaera; on the right hand she,
U||Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone
U||I’ th’ midst.” This said, in silence he remain’d
U||Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves
U||Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais’d,
U||That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.
U||“Hasten Medusa: so to adamant
U||Him shall we change;” all looking down exclaim’d.
U||“E’en when by Theseus’ might assail’d, we took
U||No ill revenge.” “Turn thyself round, and keep
U||Thy count’nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire
U||Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return
U||Upwards would be for ever lost.” This said,
U||Himself my gentle master turn’d me round,
U||Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own
U||He also hid me. Ye of intellect
U||Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal’d
U||Under close texture of the mystic strain!
U||And now there came o’er the perturbed waves
U||Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made
U||Either shore tremble, as if of a wind
U||Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,
U||That ’gainst some forest driving all its might,
U||Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls
U||Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps
U||Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.
U||Mine eyes he loos’d, and spake: “And now direct
U||Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,
U||There, thickest where the smoke ascends.” As frogs
U||Before their foe the serpent, through the wave
U||Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one
U||Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits
U||Destroy’d, so saw I fleeing before one
U||Who pass’d with unwet feet the Stygian sound.
U||He, from his face removing the gross air,
U||Oft his left hand forth stretch’d, and seem’d alone
U||By that annoyance wearied. I perceiv’d
U||That he was sent from heav’n, and to my guide
U||Turn’d me, who signal made that I should stand
U||Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full
U||Of noble anger seem’d he! To the gate
U||He came, and with his wand touch’d it, whereat
U||Open without impediment it flew.
U||“Outcasts of heav’n! O abject race and scorn’d!”
U||Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,
U||“Whence doth this wild excess of insolence
U||Lodge in you? wherefore kick you ’gainst that will
U||Ne’er frustrate of its end, and which so oft
U||Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?
U||What profits at the fays to but the horn?
U||Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence
U||Bears still, peel’d of their hair, his throat and maw.”
U||This said, he turn’d back o’er the filthy way,
U||And syllable to us spake none, but wore
U||The semblance of a man by other care
U||Beset, and keenly press’d, than thought of him
U||Who in his presence stands. Then we our steps
U||Toward that territory mov’d, secure
U||After the hallow’d words. We unoppos’d
U||There enter’d; and my mind eager to learn
U||What state a fortress like to that might hold,
U||I soon as enter’d throw mine eye around,
U||And see on every part wide-stretching space
U||Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.
U||As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,
U||Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro’s gulf,
U||That closes Italy and laves her bounds,
U||The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;
U||So was it here, save what in horror here
U||Excell’d: for ’midst the graves were scattered flames,
U||Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn’d,
U||That iron for no craft there hotter needs.
U||Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath
U||From them forth issu’d lamentable moans,
U||Such as the sad and tortur’d well might raise.
U||I thus: “Master! say who are these, interr’d
U||Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear
U||The dolorous sighs?” He answer thus return’d:
U||“The arch-heretics are here, accompanied
U||By every sect their followers; and much more,
U||Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like
U||With like is buried; and the monuments
U||Are different in degrees of heat.” This said,
U||He to the right hand turning, on we pass’d
U||Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.
U||CANTO X
U||Now by a secret pathway we proceed,
U||Between the walls, that hem the region round,
U||And the tormented souls: my master first,
U||I close behind his steps. “Virtue supreme!”
U||I thus began; “who through these ample orbs
U||In circuit lead’st me, even as thou will’st,
U||Speak thou, and satisfy my wish. May those,
U||Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?
U||Already all the lids are rais’d, and none
U||O’er them keeps watch.” He thus in answer spake
U||“They shall be closed all, what-time they here
U||From Josaphat return’d shall come, and bring
U||Their bodies, which above they now have left.
U||The cemetery on this part obtain
U||With Epicurus all his followers,
U||Who with the body make the spirit die.
U||Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
U||Both to the question ask’d, and to the wish,
U||Which thou conceal’st in silence.” I replied:
U||“I keep not, guide belov’d! from thee my heart
U||Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,
U||A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.”
U||“O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire
U||Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!
U||Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance
U||Declares the place of thy nativity
U||To be that noble land, with which perchance
U||I too severely dealt.” Sudden that sound
U||Forth issu’d from a vault, whereat in fear
U||I somewhat closer to my leader’s side
U||Approaching, he thus spake: “What dost thou? Turn.
U||Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself
U||Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all
U||Expos’d behold him.” On his face was mine
U||Already fix’d; his breast and forehead there
U||Erecting, seem’d as in high scorn he held
U||E’en hell. Between the sepulchres to him
U||My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,
U||This warning added: “See thy words be clear!”
U||He, soon as there I stood at the tomb’s foot,
U||Ey’d me a space, then in disdainful mood
U||Address’d me: “Say, what ancestors were thine?”
U||I, willing to obey him, straight reveal’d
U||The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow
U||Somewhat uplifting, cried: “Fiercely were they
U||Adverse to me, my party, and the blood
U||From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad
U||Scatter’d them.” “Though driv’n out, yet they each time
U||From all parts,” answer’d I, “return’d; an art
U||Which yours have shown, they are not skill’d to learn.”
U||Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,
U||Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,
U||Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais’d.
U||It look’d around, as eager to explore
U||If there were other with me; but perceiving
U||That fond imagination quench’d, with tears
U||Thus spake: “If thou through this blind prison go’st.
U||Led by thy lofty genius and profound,
U||Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?”
U||I straight replied: “Not of myself I come,
U||By him, who there expects me, through this clime
U||Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son
U||Had in contempt.” Already had his words
U||And mode of punishment read me his name,
U||Whence I so fully answer’d. He at once
U||Exclaim’d, up starting, “How! said’st thou he HAD?
U||No longer lives he? Strikes not on his eye
U||The blessed daylight?” Then of some delay
U||I made ere my reply aware, down fell
U||Supine, not after forth appear’d he more.
U||Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom
U||I yet was station’d, chang’d not count’nance stern,
U||Nor mov’d the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.
U||“And if,” continuing the first discourse,
U||“They in this art,” he cried, “small skill have shown,
U||That doth torment me more e’en than this bed.
U||But not yet fifty times shall be relum’d
U||Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,
U||Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.
U||So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,
U||As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,
U||Against my kin this people is so fell?”
U||“The slaughter and great havoc,” I replied,
U||“That colour’d Arbia’s flood with crimson stain—
U||To these impute, that in our hallow’d dome
U||Such orisons ascend.” Sighing he shook
U||The head, then thus resum’d: “In that affray
U||I stood not singly, nor without just cause
U||Assuredly should with the rest have stirr’d;
U||But singly there I stood, when by consent
U||Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz’d,
U||The one who openly forbad the deed.”
U||“So may thy lineage find at last repose,”
U||I thus adjur’d him, “as thou solve this knot,
U||Which now involves my mind. If right I hear,
U||Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time
U||Leads with him, of the present uninform’d.”
U||“We view, as one who hath an evil sight,”
U||He answer’d, “plainly, objects far remote:
U||So much of his large spendour yet imparts
U||The Almighty Ruler; but when they approach
U||Or actually exist, our intellect
U||Then wholly fails, nor of your human state
U||Except what others bring us know we aught.
U||Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all
U||Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,
U||When on futurity the portals close.”
U||Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse
U||Smitten, I added thus: “Now shalt thou say
U||To him there fallen, that his offspring still
U||Is to the living join’d; and bid him know,
U||That if from answer silent I abstain’d,
U||’Twas that my thought was occupied intent
U||Upon that error, which thy help hath solv’d.”
U||But now my master summoning me back
U||I heard, and with more eager haste besought
U||The spirit to inform me, who with him
U||Partook his lot. He answer thus return’d:
U||“More than a thousand with me here are laid
U||Within is Frederick, second of that name,
U||And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest
U||I speak not.” He, this said, from sight withdrew.
U||But I my steps towards the ancient bard
U||Reverting, ruminated on the words
U||Betokening me such ill. Onward he mov’d,
U||And thus in going question’d: “Whence the amaze
U||That holds thy senses wrapt?” I satisfied
U||The inquiry, and the sage enjoin’d me straight:
U||“Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard
U||To thee importing harm; and note thou this,”
U||With his rais’d finger bidding me take heed,
U||“When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,
U||Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life
U||The future tenour will to thee unfold.”
U||Forthwith he to the left hand turn’d his feet:
U||We left the wall, and tow’rds the middle space
U||Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;
U||Which e’en thus high exhal’d its noisome steam.
U||CANTO XI
U||Upon the utmost verge of a high bank,
U||By craggy rocks environ’d round, we came,
U||Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow’d:
U||And here to shun the horrible excess
U||Of fetid exhalation, upward cast
U||From the profound abyss, behind the lid
U||Of a great monument we stood retir’d,
U||Whereon this scroll I mark’d: “I have in charge
U||Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew
U||From the right path.—Ere our descent behooves
U||We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,
U||To the dire breath accustom’d, afterward
U||Regard it not.” My master thus; to whom
U||Answering I spake: “Some compensation find
U||That the time past not wholly lost.” He then:
U||“Lo! how my thoughts e’en to thy wishes tend!
U||My son! within these rocks,” he thus began,
U||“Are three close circles in gradation plac’d,
U||As these which now thou leav’st. Each one is full
U||Of spirits accurs’d; but that the sight alone
U||Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how
U||And for what cause in durance they abide.
U||“Of all malicious act abhorr’d in heaven,
U||The end is injury; and all such end
U||Either by force or fraud works other’s woe
U||But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,
U||To God is more displeasing; and beneath
U||The fraudulent are therefore doom’d to’ endure
U||Severer pang. The violent occupy
U||All the first circle; and because to force
U||Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds
U||Each within other sep’rate is it fram’d.
U||To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man
U||Force may be offer’d; to himself I say
U||And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear
U||At full. Death, violent death, and painful wounds
U||Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes
U||By devastation, pillage, and the flames,
U||His substance. Slayers, and each one that smites
U||In malice, plund’rers, and all robbers, hence
U||The torment undergo of the first round
U||In different herds. Man can do violence
U||To himself and his own blessings: and for this
U||He in the second round must aye deplore
U||With unavailing penitence his crime,
U||Whoe’er deprives himself of life and light,
U||In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,
U||And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.
U||To God may force be offer’d, in the heart
U||Denying and blaspheming his high power,
U||And nature with her kindly law contemning.
U||And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
U||Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak
U||Contemptuously of the Godhead in their hearts.
U||“Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,
U||May be by man employ’d on one, whose trust
U||He wins, or on another who withholds
U||Strict confidence. Seems as the latter way
U||Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.
U||Whence in the second circle have their nest
U||Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,
U||Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce
U||To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,
U||With such vile scum as these. The other way
U||Forgets both Nature’s general love, and that
U||Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
U||To special faith. Whence in the lesser circle,
U||Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,
U||The traitor is eternally consum’d.”
U||I thus: “Instructor, clearly thy discourse
U||Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm
U||And its inhabitants with skill exact.
U||But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,
U||Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,
U||Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,
U||Wherefore within the city fire-illum’d
U||Are not these punish’d, if God’s wrath be on them?
U||And if it be not, wherefore in such guise
U||Are they condemned?” He answer thus return’d:
U||“Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,
U||Not so accustom’d? or what other thoughts
U||Possess it? Dwell not in thy memory
U||The words, wherein thy ethic page describes
U||Three dispositions adverse to Heav’n’s will,
U||Incont’nence, malice, and mad brutishness,
U||And how incontinence the least offends
U||God, and least guilt incurs? If well thou note
U||This judgment, and remember who they are,
U||Without these walls to vain repentance doom’d,
U||Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac’d
U||From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours
U||Justice divine on them its vengeance down.”
U||“O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,
U||Thou so content’st me, when thou solv’st my doubt,
U||That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.
U||Yet somewhat turn thee back,” I in these words
U||Continu’d, “where thou saidst, that usury
U||Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot
U||Perplex’d unravel.” He thus made reply:
U||“Philosophy, to an attentive ear,
U||Clearly points out, not in one part alone,
U||How imitative nature takes her course
U||From the celestial mind and from its art:
U||And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,
U||Not many leaves scann’d o’er, observing well
U||Thou shalt discover, that your art on her
U||Obsequious follows, as the learner treads
U||In his instructor’s step, so that your art
U||Deserves the name of second in descent
U||From God. These two, if thou recall to mind
U||Creation’s holy book, from the beginning
U||Were the right source of life and excellence
U||To human kind. But in another path
U||The usurer walks; and Nature in herself
U||And in her follower thus he sets at nought,
U||Placing elsewhere his hope. But follow now
U||My steps on forward journey bent; for now
U||The Pisces play with undulating glance
U||Along the horizon, and the Wain lies all
U||O’er the north-west; and onward there a space
U||Is our steep passage down the rocky height.”
U||CANTO XII
U||The place where to descend the precipice
U||We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge
U||Such object lay, as every eye would shun.
U||As is that ruin, which Adice’s stream
U||On this side Trento struck, should’ring the wave,
U||Or loos’d by earthquake or for lack of prop;
U||For from the mountain’s summit, whence it mov’d
U||To the low level, so the headlong rock
U||Is shiver’d, that some passage it might give
U||To him who from above would pass; e’en such
U||Into the chasm was that descent: and there
U||At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch’d
U||The infamy of Crete, detested brood
U||Of the feign’d heifer: and at sight of us
U||It gnaw’d itself, as one with rage distract.
U||To him my guide exclaim’d: “Perchance thou deem’st
U||The King of Athens here, who, in the world
U||Above, thy death contriv’d. Monster! avaunt!
U||He comes not tutor’d by thy sister’s art,
U||But to behold your torments is he come.”
U||Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring
U||Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow
U||Hath struck him, but unable to proceed
U||Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge
U||The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim’d:
U||“Run to the passage! while he storms, ’t is well
U||That thou descend.” Thus down our road we took
U||Through those dilapidated crags, that oft
U||Mov’d underneath my feet, to weight like theirs
U||Unus’d. I pond’ring went, and thus he spake:
U||“Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin’d steep,
U||Guarded by the brute violence, which I
U||Have vanquish’d now. Know then, that when I erst
U||Hither descended to the nether hell,
U||This rock was not yet fallen. But past doubt
U||(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,
U||Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
U||Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds
U||Such trembling seiz’d the deep concave and foul,
U||I thought the universe was thrill’d with love,
U||Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft
U||Been into chaos turn’d: and in that point,
U||Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down.
U||But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood
U||Approaches, in the which all those are steep’d,
U||Who have by violence injur’d.” O blind lust!
U||O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on
U||In the brief life, and in the eternal then
U||Thus miserably o’erwhelm us. I beheld
U||An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,
U||As circling all the plain; for so my guide
U||Had told. Between it and the rampart’s base
U||On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm’d,
U||As to the chase they on the earth were wont.
U||At seeing us descend they each one stood;
U||And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows
U||And missile weapons chosen first; of whom
U||One cried from far: “Say to what pain ye come
U||Condemn’d, who down this steep have journied? Speak
U||From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.”
U||To whom my guide: “Our answer shall be made
U||To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come.
U||Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash.”
U||Then me he touch’d, and spake: “Nessus is this,
U||Who for the fair Deianira died,
U||And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.
U||He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,
U||Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs’d;
U||That other Pholus, prone to wrath.” Around
U||The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts
U||At whatsoever spirit dares emerge
U||From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.
U||We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,
U||Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,
U||And with the notch push’d back his shaggy beard
U||To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view
U||Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim’d:
U||“Are ye aware, that he who comes behind
U||Moves what he touches? The feet of the dead
U||Are not so wont.” My trusty guide, who now
U||Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,
U||Thus made reply: “He is indeed alive,
U||And solitary so must needs by me
U||Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc’d
U||By strict necessity, not by delight.
U||She left her joyful harpings in the sky,
U||Who this new office to my care consign’d.
U||He is no robber, no dark spirit I.
U||But by that virtue, which empowers my step
U||To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,
U||One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,
U||Who to the ford may lead us, and convey
U||Across, him mounted on his back; for he
U||Is not a spirit that may walk the air.”
U||Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus
U||To Nessus spake: “Return, and be their guide.
U||And if ye chance to cross another troop,
U||Command them keep aloof.” Onward we mov’d,
U||The faithful escort by our side, along
U||The border of the crimson-seething flood,
U||Whence from those steep’d within loud shrieks arose.
U||Some there I mark’d, as high as to their brow
U||Immers’d, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:
U||“These are the souls of tyrants, who were given
U||To blood and rapine. Here they wail aloud
U||Their merciless wrongs. Here Alexander dwells,
U||And Dionysius fell, who many a year
U||Of woe wrought for fair Sicily. That brow
U||Whereon the hair so jetty clust’ring hangs,
U||Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks
U||Obizzo’ of Este, in the world destroy’d
U||By his foul step-son.” To the bard rever’d
U||I turned me round, and thus he spake; “Let him
U||Be to thee now first leader, me but next
U||To him in rank.” Then farther on a space
U||The Centaur paus’d, near some, who at the throat
U||Were extant from the wave; and showing us
U||A spirit by itself apart retir’d,
U||Exclaim’d: “He in God’s bosom smote the heart,
U||Which yet is honour’d on the bank of Thames.”
U||A race I next espied, who held the head,
U||And even all the bust above the stream.
U||’Midst these I many a face remember’d well.
U||Thus shallow more and more the blood became,
U||So that at last it but imbru’d the feet;
U||And there our passage lay athwart the foss.
U||“As ever on this side the boiling wave
U||Thou seest diminishing,” the Centaur said,
U||“So on the other, be thou well assur’d,
U||It lower still and lower sinks its bed,
U||Till in that part it reuniting join,
U||Where ’t is the lot of tyranny to mourn.
U||There Heav’n’s stern justice lays chastising hand
U||On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,
U||On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts
U||Tears ever by the seething flood unlock’d
U||From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,
U||Pazzo the other nam’d, who fill’d the ways
U||With violence and war.” This said, he turn’d,
U||And quitting us, alone repass’d the ford.
U||CANTO XIII
U||Ere Nessus yet had reach’d the other bank,
U||We enter’d on a forest, where no track
U||Of steps had worn a way. Not verdant there
U||The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light
U||The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform’d
U||And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns
U||Instead, with venom fill’d. Less sharp than these,
U||Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide
U||Those animals, that hate the cultur’d fields,
U||Betwixt Corneto and Cecina’s stream.
U||Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same
U||Who from the Strophades the Trojan band
U||Drove with dire boding of their future woe.
U||Broad are their pennons, of the human form
U||Their neck and count’nance, arm’d with talons keen
U||The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings
U||These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.
U||The kind instructor in these words began:
U||“Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now
U||I’ th’ second round, and shalt be, till thou come
U||Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well
U||Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,
U||As would my speech discredit.” On all sides
U||I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see
U||From whom they might have issu’d. In amaze
U||Fast bound I stood. He, as it seem’d, believ’d,
U||That I had thought so many voices came
U||From some amid those thickets close conceal’d,
U||And thus his speech resum’d: “If thou lop off
U||A single twig from one of those ill plants,
U||The thought thou hast conceiv’d shall vanish quite.”
U||Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,
U||From a great wilding gather’d I a branch,
U||And straight the trunk exclaim’d: “Why pluck’st thou me?”
U||Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,
U||These words it added: “Wherefore tear’st me thus?
U||Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?
U||Men once were we, that now are rooted here.
U||Thy hand might well have spar’d us, had we been
U||The souls of serpents.” As a brand yet green,
U||That burning at one end from the other sends
U||A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind
U||That forces out its way, so burst at once,
U||Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.
U||I, letting fall the bough, remain’d as one
U||Assail’d by terror, and the sage replied:
U||“If he, O injur’d spirit! could have believ’d
U||What he hath seen but in my verse describ’d,
U||He never against thee had stretch’d his hand.
U||But I, because the thing surpass’d belief,
U||Prompted him to this deed, which even now
U||Myself I rue. But tell me, who thou wast;
U||That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,
U||In the upper world (for thither to return
U||Is granted him) thy fame he may revive.”
U||“That pleasant word of thine,” the trunk replied
U||“Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech
U||Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge
U||A little longer, in the snare detain’d,
U||Count it not grievous. I it was, who held
U||Both keys to Frederick’s heart, and turn’d the wards,
U||Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,
U||That besides me, into his inmost breast
U||Scarce any other could admittance find.
U||The faith I bore to my high charge was such,
U||It cost me the life-blood that warm’d my veins.
U||The harlot, who ne’er turn’d her gloating eyes
U||From Caesar’s household, common vice and pest
U||Of courts, ’gainst me inflam’d the minds of all;
U||And to Augustus they so spread the flame,
U||That my glad honours chang’d to bitter woes.
U||My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought
U||Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,
U||Just as I was, unjust toward myself.
U||By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,
U||That never faith I broke to my liege lord,
U||Who merited such honour; and of you,
U||If any to the world indeed return,
U||Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies
U||Yet prostrate under envy’s cruel blow.”
U||First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words
U||Were ended, then to me the bard began:
U||“Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,
U||If more thou wish to learn.” Whence I replied:
U||“Question thou him again of whatsoe’er
U||Will, as thou think’st, content me; for no power
U||Have I to ask, such pity’ is at my heart.”
U||He thus resum’d; “So may he do for thee
U||Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet
U||Be pleas’d, imprison’d Spirit! to declare,
U||How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;
U||And whether any ever from such frame
U||Be loosen’d, if thou canst, that also tell.”
U||Thereat the trunk breath’d hard, and the wind soon
U||Chang’d into sounds articulate like these;
U||Briefly ye shall be answer’d. “When departs
U||The fierce soul from the body, by itself
U||Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf
U||By Minos doom’d, into the wood it falls,
U||No place assign’d, but wheresoever chance
U||Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,
U||It rises to a sapling, growing thence
U||A savage plant. The Harpies, on its leaves
U||Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain
U||A vent to grief. We, as the rest, shall come
U||For our own spoils, yet not so that with them
U||We may again be clad; for what a man
U||Takes from himself it is not just he have.
U||Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout
U||The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,
U||Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.”
U||Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
U||We stood, expecting farther speech, when us
U||A noise surpris’d, as when a man perceives
U||The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
U||Of station’d watch, who of the beasts and boughs
U||Loud rustling round him hears. And lo! there came
U||Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,
U||That they before them broke each fan o’ th’ wood.
U||“Haste now,” the foremost cried, “now haste thee death!”
U||The other, as seem’d, impatient of delay
U||Exclaiming, “Lano! not so bent for speed
U||Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo’s field.”
U||And then, for that perchance no longer breath
U||Suffic’d him, of himself and of a bush
U||One group he made. Behind them was the wood
U||Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,
U||As greyhounds that have newly slipp’d the leash.
U||On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,
U||And having rent him piecemeal bore away
U||The tortur’d limbs. My guide then seiz’d my hand,
U||And led me to the thicket, which in vain
U||Mourn’d through its bleeding wounds: “O Giacomo
U||Of Sant’ Andrea! what avails it thee,”
U||It cried, “that of me thou hast made thy screen?
U||For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?”
U||When o’er it he had paus’d, my master spake:
U||“Say who wast thou, that at so many points
U||Breath’st out with blood thy lamentable speech?”
U||He answer’d: “Oh, ye spirits: arriv’d in time
U||To spy the shameful havoc, that from me
U||My leaves hath sever’d thus, gather them up,
U||And at the foot of their sad parent-tree
U||Carefully lay them. In that city’ I dwelt,
U||Who for the Baptist her first patron chang’d,
U||Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
U||To work her woe: and if there still remain’d not
U||On Arno’s passage some faint glimpse of him,
U||Those citizens, who rear’d once more her walls
U||Upon the ashes left by Attila,
U||Had labour’d without profit of their toil.
U||I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.”
U||CANTO XIV
U||Soon as the charity of native land
U||Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter’d leaves
U||Collected, and to him restor’d, who now
U||Was hoarse with utt’rance. To the limit thence
U||We came, which from the third the second round
U||Divides, and where of justice is display’d
U||Contrivance horrible. Things then first seen
U||Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next
U||A plain we reach’d, that from its sterile bed
U||Each plant repell’d. The mournful wood waves round
U||Its garland on all sides, as round the wood
U||Spreads the sad foss. There, on the very edge,
U||Our steps we stay’d. It was an area wide
U||Of arid sand and thick, resembling most
U||The soil that erst by Cato’s foot was trod.
U||Vengeance of Heav’n! Oh! how shouldst thou be fear’d
U||By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!
U||Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,
U||All weeping piteously, to different laws
U||Subjected: for on the earth some lay supine,
U||Some crouching close were seated, others pac’d
U||Incessantly around; the latter tribe,
U||More numerous, those fewer who beneath
U||The torment lay, but louder in their grief.
U||O’er all the sand fell slowly wafting down
U||Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow
U||On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush’d.
U||As in the torrid Indian clime, the son
U||Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band
U||Descending, solid flames, that to the ground
U||Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop
U||To trample on the soil; for easier thus
U||The vapour was extinguish’d, while alone;
U||So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith
U||The marble glow’d underneath, as under stove
U||The viands, doubly to augment the pain.
U||Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,
U||Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off
U||The heat, still falling fresh. I thus began:
U||“Instructor! thou who all things overcom’st,
U||Except the hardy demons, that rush’d forth
U||To stop our entrance at the gate, say who
U||Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not
U||The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,
U||As by the sultry tempest immatur’d?”
U||Straight he himself, who was aware I ask’d
U||My guide of him, exclaim’d: “Such as I was
U||When living, dead such now I am. If Jove
U||Weary his workman out, from whom in ire
U||He snatch’d the lightnings, that at my last day
U||Transfix’d me, if the rest be weary out
U||At their black smithy labouring by turns
U||In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;
U||“Help, help, good Mulciber!” as erst he cried
U||In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts
U||Launch he full aim’d at me with all his might,
U||He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.”
U||Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais’d
U||Than I before had heard him: “Capaneus!
U||Thou art more punish’d, in that this thy pride
U||Lives yet unquench’d: no torrent, save thy rage,
U||Were to thy fury pain proportion’d full.”
U||Next turning round to me with milder lip
U||He spake: “This of the seven kings was one,
U||Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,
U||As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,
U||And sets his high omnipotence at nought.
U||But, as I told him, his despiteful mood
U||Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.
U||Follow me now; and look thou set not yet
U||Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood
U||Keep ever close.” Silently on we pass’d
U||To where there gushes from the forest’s bound
U||A little brook, whose crimson’d wave yet lifts
U||My hair with horror. As the rill, that runs
U||From Bulicame, to be portion’d out
U||Among the sinful women; so ran this
U||Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank
U||Stone-built, and either margin at its side,
U||Whereon I straight perceiv’d our passage lay.
U||“Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate
U||We enter’d first, whose threshold is to none
U||Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,
U||As is this river, has thine eye discern’d,
U||O’er which the flaming volley all is quench’d.”
U||So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,
U||That having giv’n me appetite to know,
U||The food he too would give, that hunger crav’d.
U||“In midst of ocean,” forthwith he began,
U||“A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam’d,
U||Under whose monarch in old times the world
U||Liv’d pure and chaste. A mountain rises there,
U||Call’d Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,
U||Deserted now like a forbidden thing.
U||It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn’s spouse,
U||Chose for the secret cradle of her son;
U||And better to conceal him, drown’d in shouts
U||His infant cries. Within the mount, upright
U||An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns
U||His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome
U||As in his mirror looks. Of finest gold
U||His head is shap’d, pure silver are the breast
U||And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.
U||And downward all beneath well-temper’d steel,
U||Save the right foot of potter’s clay, on which
U||Than on the other more erect he stands,
U||Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;
U||And from the fissure tears distil, which join’d
U||Penetrate to that cave. They in their course
U||Thus far precipitated down the rock
U||Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;
U||Then by this straiten’d channel passing hence
U||Beneath, e’en to the lowest depth of all,
U||Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself
U||Shall see it) I here give thee no account.”
U||Then I to him: “If from our world this sluice
U||Be thus deriv’d; wherefore to us but now
U||Appears it at this edge?” He straight replied:
U||“The place, thou know’st, is round; and though great part
U||Thou have already pass’d, still to the left
U||Descending to the nethermost, not yet
U||Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.
U||Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,
U||It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.”
U||Then I again inquir’d: “Where flow the streams
U||Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one
U||Thou tell’st not, and the other of that shower,
U||Thou say’st, is form’d.” He answer thus return’d:
U||“Doubtless thy questions all well pleas’d I hear.
U||Yet the red seething wave might have resolv’d
U||One thou proposest. Lethe thou shalt see,
U||But not within this hollow, in the place,
U||Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,
U||Whose blame hath been by penitence remov’d.”
U||He added: “Time is now we quit the wood.
U||Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give
U||Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;
U||For over them all vapour is extinct.”
U||CANTO XV
U||One of the solid margins bears us now
U||Envelop’d in the mist, that from the stream
U||Arising, hovers o’er, and saves from fire
U||Both piers and water. As the Flemings rear
U||Their mound, ’twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back
U||The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide
U||That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs
U||Along the Brenta, to defend their towns
U||And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt
U||On Chiarentana’s top; such were the mounds,
U||So fram’d, though not in height or bulk to these
U||Made equal, by the master, whosoe’er
U||He was, that rais’d them here. We from the wood
U||Were not so far remov’d, that turning round
U||I might not have discern’d it, when we met
U||A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.
U||They each one ey’d us, as at eventide
U||One eyes another under a new moon,
U||And toward us sharpen’d their sight as keen,
U||As an old tailor at his needle’s eye.
U||Thus narrowly explor’d by all the tribe,
U||I was agniz’d of one, who by the skirt
U||Caught me, and cried, “What wonder have we here!”
U||And I, when he to me outstretch’d his arm,
U||Intently fix’d my ken on his parch’d looks,
U||That although smirch’d with fire, they hinder’d not
U||But I remember’d him; and towards his face
U||My hand inclining, answer’d: “Sir! Brunetto!
U||“And art thou here?” He thus to me: “My son!
U||Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto
U||Latini but a little space with thee
U||Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed.”
U||I thus to him replied: “Much as I can,
U||I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,
U||That I here seat me with thee, I consent;
U||His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain’d.”
U||“O son!” said he, “whoever of this throng
U||One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,
U||No fan to ventilate him, when the fire
U||Smites sorest. Pass thou therefore on. I close
U||Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin
U||My troop, who go mourning their endless doom.”
U||I dar’d not from the path descend to tread
U||On equal ground with him, but held my head
U||Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.
U||“What chance or destiny,” thus he began,
U||“Ere the last day conducts thee here below?
U||And who is this, that shows to thee the way?”
U||“There up aloft,” I answer’d, “in the life
U||Serene, I wander’d in a valley lost,
U||Before mine age had to its fullness reach’d.
U||But yester-morn I left it: then once more
U||Into that vale returning, him I met;
U||And by this path homeward he leads me back.”
U||“If thou,” he answer’d, “follow but thy star,
U||Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:
U||Unless in fairer days my judgment err’d.
U||And if my fate so early had not chanc’d,
U||Seeing the heav’ns thus bounteous to thee, I
U||Had gladly giv’n thee comfort in thy work.
U||But that ungrateful and malignant race,
U||Who in old times came down from Fesole,
U||Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,
U||Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.
U||Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour’d crabs
U||It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.
U||Old fame reports them in the world for blind,
U||Covetous, envious, proud. Look to it well:
U||Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways. For thee
U||Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,
U||That thou by either party shalt be crav’d
U||With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far
U||From the goat’s tooth. The herd of Fesole
U||May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,
U||If any such yet spring on their rank bed,
U||In which the holy seed revives, transmitted
U||From those true Romans, who still there remain’d,
U||When it was made the nest of so much ill.”
U||“Were all my wish fulfill’d,” I straight replied,
U||“Thou from the confines of man’s nature yet
U||Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind
U||Is fix’d, and now strikes full upon my heart
U||The dear, benign, paternal image, such
U||As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me
U||The way for man to win eternity;
U||And how I priz’d the lesson, it behooves,
U||That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,
U||What of my fate thou tell’st, that write I down:
U||And with another text to comment on
U||For her I keep it, the celestial dame,
U||Who will know all, if I to her arrive.
U||This only would I have thee clearly note:
U||That so my conscience have no plea against me;
U||Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar’d.
U||Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.
U||Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,
U||The clown his mattock; all things have their course.”
U||Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
U||Turn’d himself back, then look’d at me and spake:
U||“He listens to good purpose who takes note.”
U||I not the less still on my way proceed,
U||Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire
U||Who are most known and chief among his tribe.
U||“To know of some is well;” thus he replied,
U||“But of the rest silence may best beseem.
U||Time would not serve us for report so long.
U||In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,
U||Men of great learning and no less renown,
U||By one same sin polluted in the world.
U||With them is Priscian, and Accorso’s son
U||Francesco herds among that wretched throng:
U||And, if the wish of so impure a blotch
U||Possess’d thee, him thou also might’st have seen,
U||Who by the servants’ servant was transferr’d
U||From Arno’s seat to Bacchiglione, where
U||His ill-strain’d nerves he left. I more would add,
U||But must from farther speech and onward way
U||Alike desist, for yonder I behold
U||A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.
U||A company, with whom I may not sort,
U||Approaches. I commend my TREASURE to thee,
U||Wherein I yet survive; my sole request.”
U||This said he turn’d, and seem’d as one of those,
U||Who o’er Verona’s champain try their speed
U||For the green mantle, and of them he seem’d,
U||Not he who loses but who gains the prize.
U||CANTO XVI
U||Now came I where the water’s din was heard,
U||As down it fell into the other round,
U||Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:
U||When forth together issu’d from a troop,
U||That pass’d beneath the fierce tormenting storm,
U||Three spirits, running swift. They towards us came,
U||And each one cried aloud, “Oh do thou stay!
U||Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem
U||To be some inmate of our evil land.”
U||Ah me! what wounds I mark’d upon their limbs,
U||Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!
U||E’en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.
U||Attentive to their cry my teacher paus’d,
U||And turn’d to me his visage, and then spake;
U||“Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:
U||And were ’t not for the nature of the place,
U||Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,
U||That haste had better suited thee than them.”
U||They, when we stopp’d, resum’d their ancient wail,
U||And soon as they had reach’d us, all the three
U||Whirl’d round together in one restless wheel.
U||As naked champions, smear’d with slippery oil,
U||Are wont intent to watch their place of hold
U||And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;
U||Thus each one, as he wheel’d, his countenance
U||At me directed, so that opposite
U||The neck mov’d ever to the twinkling feet.
U||“If misery of this drear wilderness,”
U||Thus one began, “added to our sad cheer
U||And destitute, do call forth scorn on us
U||And our entreaties, let our great renown
U||Incline thee to inform us who thou art,
U||That dost imprint with living feet unharm’d
U||The soil of Hell. He, in whose track thou see’st
U||My steps pursuing, naked though he be
U||And reft of all, was of more high estate
U||Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste
U||Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call’d,
U||Who in his lifetime many a noble act
U||Achiev’d, both by his wisdom and his sword.
U||The other, next to me that beats the sand,
U||Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,
U||In the upper world, of honour; and myself
U||Who in this torment do partake with them,
U||Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife
U||Of savage temper, more than aught beside
U||Hath to this evil brought.” If from the fire
U||I had been shelter’d, down amidst them straight
U||I then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,
U||Would have restrain’d my going; but that fear
U||Of the dire burning vanquish’d the desire,
U||Which made me eager of their wish’d embrace.
U||I then began: “Not scorn, but grief much more,
U||Such as long time alone can cure, your doom
U||Fix’d deep within me, soon as this my lord
U||Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect
U||That such a race, as ye are, was at hand.
U||I am a countryman of yours, who still
U||Affectionate have utter’d, and have heard
U||Your deeds and names renown’d. Leaving the gall
U||For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide
U||Hath promis’d to me. But behooves, that far
U||As to the centre first I downward tend.”
U||“So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,”
U||He answer straight return’d; “and so thy fame
U||Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,
U||If courtesy and valour, as they wont,
U||Dwell in our city, or have vanish’d clean?
U||For one amidst us late condemn’d to wail,
U||Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,
U||Grieves us no little by the news he brings.”
U||“An upstart multitude and sudden gains,
U||Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee
U||Engender’d, so that now in tears thou mourn’st!”
U||Thus cried I with my face uprais’d, and they
U||All three, who for an answer took my words,
U||Look’d at each other, as men look when truth
U||Comes to their ear. “If thou at other times,”
U||They all at once rejoin’d, “so easily
U||Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,
U||Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!
U||Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,
U||Returning to behold the radiant stars,
U||When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,
U||See that of us thou speak among mankind.”
U||This said, they broke the circle, and so swift
U||Fled, that as pinions seem’d their nimble feet.
U||Not in so short a time might one have said
U||“Amen,” as they had vanish’d. Straight my guide
U||Pursu’d his track. I follow’d; and small space
U||Had we pass’d onward, when the water’s sound
U||Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce
U||Heard one another’s speech for the loud din.
U||E’en as the river, that holds on its course
U||Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,
U||On the left side of Apennine, toward
U||The east, which Acquacheta higher up
U||They call, ere it descend into the vale,
U||At Forli by that name no longer known,
U||Rebellows o’er Saint Benedict, roll’d on
U||From the Alpine summit down a precipice,
U||Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;
U||Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,
U||That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,
U||So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn’d.
U||I had a cord that brac’d my girdle round,
U||Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take
U||The painted leopard. This when I had all
U||Unloosen’d from me (so my master bade)
U||I gather’d up, and stretch’d it forth to him.
U||Then to the right he turn’d, and from the brink
U||Standing few paces distant, cast it down
U||Into the deep abyss. “And somewhat strange,”
U||Thus to myself I spake, “signal so strange
U||Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye
U||Thus follows.” Ah! what caution must men use
U||With those who look not at the deed alone,
U||But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!
U||“Quickly shall come,” he said, “what I expect,
U||Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof
U||Thy thought is dreaming.” Ever to that truth,
U||Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,
U||A man, if possible, should bar his lip;
U||Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach.
U||But silence here were vain; and by these notes
U||Which now I sing, reader! I swear to thee,
U||So may they favour find to latest times!
U||That through the gross and murky air I spied
U||A shape come swimming up, that might have quell’d
U||The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise
U||As one returns, who hath been down to loose
U||An anchor grappled fast against some rock,
U||Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,
U||Who upward springing close draws in his feet.
U||CANTO XVII
U||“Lo! the fell monster with the deadly sting!
U||Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls
U||And firm embattled spears, and with his filth
U||Taints all the world!” Thus me my guide address’d,
U||And beckon’d him, that he should come to shore,
U||Near to the stony causeway’s utmost edge.
U||Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear’d,
U||His head and upper part expos’d on land,
U||But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
U||His face the semblance of a just man’s wore,
U||So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
U||The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
U||Reach’d to the armpits, and the back and breast,
U||And either side, were painted o’er with nodes
U||And orbits. Colours variegated more
U||Nor Turks nor Tartars e’er on cloth of state
U||With interchangeable embroidery wove,
U||Nor spread Arachne o’er her curious loom.
U||As ofttimes a light skiff, moor’d to the shore,
U||Stands part in water, part upon the land;
U||Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,
U||The beaver settles watching for his prey;
U||So on the rim, that fenc’d the sand with rock,
U||Sat perch’d the fiend of evil. In the void
U||Glancing, his tail upturn’d its venomous fork,
U||With sting like scorpion’s arm’d. Then thus my guide:
U||“Now need our way must turn few steps apart,
U||Far as to that ill beast, who couches there.”
U||Thereat toward the right our downward course
U||We shap’d, and, better to escape the flame
U||And burning marle, ten paces on the verge
U||Proceeded. Soon as we to him arrive,
U||A little further on mine eye beholds
U||A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand
U||Near the wide chasm. Forthwith my master spake:
U||“That to the full thy knowledge may extend
U||Of all this round contains, go now, and mark
U||The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.
U||Till thou returnest, I with him meantime
U||Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe
U||The aid of his strong shoulders.” Thus alone
U||Yet forward on the extremity I pac’d
U||Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe
U||Were seated. At the eyes forth gush’d their pangs.
U||Against the vapours and the torrid soil
U||Alternately their shifting hands they plied.
U||Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply
U||Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore
U||By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.
U||Noting the visages of some, who lay
U||Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,
U||One of them all I knew not; but perceiv’d,
U||That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch
U||With colours and with emblems various mark’d,
U||On which it seem’d as if their eye did feed.
U||And when amongst them looking round I came,
U||A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,
U||That wore a lion’s countenance and port.
U||Then still my sight pursuing its career,
U||Another I beheld, than blood more red.
U||A goose display of whiter wing than curd.
U||And one, who bore a fat and azure swine
U||Pictur’d on his white scrip, addressed me thus:
U||“What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know,
U||Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here
U||Vitaliano on my left shall sit.
U||A Paduan with these Florentines am I.
U||Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming
U||‘O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch
U||With the three beaks will bring!’” This said, he writh’d
U||The mouth, and loll’d the tongue out, like an ox
U||That licks his nostrils. I, lest longer stay
U||He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,
U||Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn’d.
U||My guide already seated on the haunch
U||Of the fierce animal I found; and thus
U||He me encourag’d. “Be thou stout; be bold.
U||Down such a steep flight must we now descend!
U||Mount thou before: for that no power the tail
U||May have to harm thee, I will be i’ th’ midst.”
U||As one, who hath an ague fit so near,
U||His nails already are turn’d blue, and he
U||Quivers all o’er, if he but eye the shade;
U||Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.
U||But shame soon interpos’d her threat, who makes
U||The servant bold in presence of his lord.
U||I settled me upon those shoulders huge,
U||And would have said, but that the words to aid
U||My purpose came not, “Look thou clasp me firm!”
U||But he whose succour then not first I prov’d,
U||Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,
U||Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:
U||“Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres
U||Of ample circuit, easy thy descent.
U||Think on th’ unusual burden thou sustain’st.”
U||As a small vessel, back’ning out from land,
U||Her station quits; so thence the monster loos’d,
U||And when he felt himself at large, turn’d round
U||There where the breast had been, his forked tail.
U||Thus, like an eel, outstretch’d at length he steer’d,
U||Gath’ring the air up with retractile claws.
U||Not greater was the dread when Phaeton
U||The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,
U||Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;
U||Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv’d,
U||By liquefaction of the scalded wax,
U||The trusted pennons loosen’d from his loins,
U||His sire exclaiming loud, “Ill way thou keep’st!”
U||Than was my dread, when round me on each part
U||The air I view’d, and other object none
U||Save the fell beast. He slowly sailing, wheels
U||His downward motion, unobserv’d of me,
U||But that the wind, arising to my face,
U||Breathes on me from below. Now on our right
U||I heard the cataract beneath us leap
U||With hideous crash; whence bending down to’ explore,
U||New terror I conceiv’d at the steep plunge:
U||For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:
U||So that all trembling close I crouch’d my limbs,
U||And then distinguish’d, unperceiv’d before,
U||By the dread torments that on every side
U||Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound.
U||As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,
U||But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair
U||The falconer cries, “Ah me! thou stoop’st to earth!”
U||Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky
U||In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits
U||At distance from his lord in angry mood;
U||So Geryon lighting places us on foot
U||Low down at base of the deep-furrow’d rock,
U||And, of his burden there discharg’d, forthwith
U||Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string.
U||CANTO XVIII
U||There is a place within the depths of hell
U||Call’d Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain’d
U||With hue ferruginous, e’en as the steep
U||That round it circling winds. Right in the midst
U||Of that abominable region, yawns
U||A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame
U||Due time shall tell. The circle, that remains,
U||Throughout its round, between the gulf and base
U||Of the high craggy banks, successive forms
U||Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk.
U||As where to guard the walls, full many a foss
U||Begirds some stately castle, sure defence
U||Affording to the space within, so here
U||Were model’d these; and as like fortresses
U||E’en from their threshold to the brink without,
U||Are flank’d with bridges; from the rock’s low base
U||Thus flinty paths advanc’d, that ’cross the moles
U||And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,
U||That in one bound collected cuts them off.
U||Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves
U||From Geryon’s back dislodg’d. The bard to left
U||Held on his way, and I behind him mov’d.
U||On our right hand new misery I saw,
U||New pains, new executioners of wrath,
U||That swarming peopled the first chasm. Below
U||Were naked sinners. Hitherward they came,
U||Meeting our faces from the middle point,
U||With us beyond but with a larger stride.
U||E’en thus the Romans, when the year returns
U||Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid
U||The thronging multitudes, their means devise
U||For such as pass the bridge; that on one side
U||All front toward the castle, and approach
U||Saint Peter’s fane, on th’ other towards the mount.
U||Each divers way along the grisly rock,
U||Horn’d demons I beheld, with lashes huge,
U||That on their back unmercifully smote.
U||Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!
U||None for the second waited nor the third.
U||Meantime as on I pass’d, one met my sight
U||Whom soon as view’d; “Of him,” cried I, “not yet
U||Mine eye hath had his fill.” With fixed gaze
U||I therefore scann’d him. Straight the teacher kind
U||Paus’d with me, and consented I should walk
U||Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,
U||Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down.
U||But it avail’d him nought; for I exclaim’d:
U||“Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,
U||Unless thy features do belie thee much,
U||Venedico art thou. But what brings thee
U||Into this bitter seas’ning?” He replied:
U||“Unwillingly I answer to thy words.
U||But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls
U||The world I once inhabited, constrains me.
U||Know then ’twas I who led fair Ghisola
U||To do the Marquis’ will, however fame
U||The shameful tale have bruited. Nor alone
U||Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn
U||Rather with us the place is so o’erthrong’d
U||That not so many tongues this day are taught,
U||Betwixt the Reno and Savena’s stream,
U||To answer SIPA in their country’s phrase.
U||And if of that securer proof thou need,
U||Remember but our craving thirst for gold.”
U||Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong
U||Struck, and exclaim’d, “Away! corrupter! here
U||Women are none for sale.” Forthwith I join’d
U||My escort, and few paces thence we came
U||To where a rock forth issued from the bank.
U||That easily ascended, to the right
U||Upon its splinter turning, we depart
U||From those eternal barriers. When arriv’d,
U||Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass
U||The scourged souls: “Pause here,” the teacher said,
U||“And let these others miserable, now
U||Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,
U||For that together they with us have walk’d.”
U||From the old bridge we ey’d the pack, who came
U||From th’ other side towards us, like the rest,
U||Excoriate from the lash. My gentle guide,
U||By me unquestion’d, thus his speech resum’d:
U||“Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,
U||And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.
U||How yet the regal aspect he retains!
U||Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won
U||The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle
U||His passage thither led him, when those bold
U||And pitiless women had slain all their males.
U||There he with tokens and fair witching words
U||Hypsipyle beguil’d, a virgin young,
U||Who first had all the rest herself beguil’d.
U||Impregnated he left her there forlorn.
U||Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.
U||Here too Medea’s inj’ries are avenged.
U||All bear him company, who like deceit
U||To his have practis’d. And thus much to know
U||Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those
U||Whom its keen torments urge.” Now had we come
U||Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten’d path
U||Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.
U||Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,
U||Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,
U||With wide-stretch’d nostrils snort, and on themselves
U||Smite with their palms. Upon the banks a scurf
U||From the foul steam condens’d, encrusting hung,
U||That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.
U||So hollow is the depth, that from no part,
U||Save on the summit of the rocky span,
U||Could I distinguish aught. Thus far we came;
U||And thence I saw, within the foss below,
U||A crowd immers’d in ordure, that appear’d
U||Draff of the human body. There beneath
U||Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark’d
U||One with his head so grim’d, ’twere hard to deem,
U||If he were clerk or layman. Loud he cried:
U||“Why greedily thus bendest more on me,
U||Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?”
U||“Because if true my mem’ry,” I replied,
U||“I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,
U||And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.
U||Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more.”
U||Then beating on his brain these words he spake:
U||“Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,
U||Wherewith I ne’er enough could glut my tongue.”
U||My leader thus: “A little further stretch
U||Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note
U||Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,
U||Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,
U||Now crouching down, now risen on her feet.
U||“Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip
U||Answer’d her doting paramour that ask’d,
U||‘Thankest me much!’—‘Say rather wondrously,’
U||And seeing this here satiate be our view.”
U||CANTO XIX
U||Woe to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,
U||His wretched followers! who the things of God,
U||Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,
U||Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute
U||For gold and silver in adultery!
U||Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours
U||Is the third chasm. Upon the following vault
U||We now had mounted, where the rock impends
U||Directly o’er the centre of the foss.
U||Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,
U||Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,
U||And in the evil world, how just a meed
U||Allotting by thy virtue unto all!
U||I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides
U||And in its bottom full of apertures,
U||All equal in their width, and circular each,
U||Nor ample less nor larger they appear’d
U||Than in Saint John’s fair dome of me belov’d
U||Those fram’d to hold the pure baptismal streams,
U||One of the which I brake, some few years past,
U||To save a whelming infant; and be this
U||A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
U||The motive of my deed. From out the mouth
U||Of every one, emerg’d a sinner’s feet
U||And of the legs high upward as the calf
U||The rest beneath was hid. On either foot
U||The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints
U||Glanc’d with such violent motion, as had snapt
U||Asunder cords or twisted withs. As flame,
U||Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along
U||The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;
U||So here, from heel to point, glided the flames.
U||“Master! say who is he, than all the rest
U||Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom
U||A ruddier flame doth prey?” I thus inquir’d.
U||“If thou be willing,” he replied, “that I
U||Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,
U||He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs.”
U||I then: “As pleases thee to me is best.
U||Thou art my lord; and know’st that ne’er I quit
U||Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou.”
U||Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn’d,
U||And on our left descended to the depth,
U||A narrow strait and perforated close.
U||Nor from his side my leader set me down,
U||Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb
U||Quiv’ring express’d his pang. “Whoe’er thou art,
U||Sad spirit! thus revers’d, and as a stake
U||Driv’n in the soil!” I in these words began,
U||“If thou be able, utter forth thy voice.”
U||There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive
U||A wretch for murder doom’d, who e’en when fix’d,
U||Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays.
U||He shouted: “Ha! already standest there?
U||Already standest there, O Boniface!
U||By many a year the writing play’d me false.
U||So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,
U||For which thou fearedst not in guile to take
U||The lovely lady, and then mangle her?”
U||I felt as those who, piercing not the drift
U||Of answer made them, stand as if expos’d
U||In mockery, nor know what to reply,
U||When Virgil thus admonish’d: “Tell him quick,
U||I am not he, not he, whom thou believ’st.”
U||And I, as was enjoin’d me, straight replied.
U||That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,
U||And sighing next in woeful accent spake:
U||“What then of me requirest?” “If to know
U||So much imports thee, who I am, that thou
U||Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn
U||That in the mighty mantle I was rob’d,
U||And of a she-bear was indeed the son,
U||So eager to advance my whelps, that there
U||My having in my purse above I stow’d,
U||And here myself. Under my head are dragg’d
U||The rest, my predecessors in the guilt
U||Of simony. Stretch’d at their length they lie
U||Along an opening in the rock. ’Midst them
U||I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,
U||For whom I took thee, when so hastily
U||I question’d. But already longer time
U||Hath pass’d, since my souls kindled, and I thus
U||Upturn’d have stood, than is his doom to stand
U||Planted with fiery feet. For after him,
U||One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,
U||From forth the west, a shepherd without law,
U||Fated to cover both his form and mine.
U||He a new Jason shall be call’d, of whom
U||In Maccabees we read; and favour such
U||As to that priest his king indulgent show’d,
U||Shall be of France’s monarch shown to him.”
U||I know not if I here too far presum’d,
U||But in this strain I answer’d: “Tell me now,
U||What treasures from St. Peter at the first
U||Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys
U||Into his charge? Surely he ask’d no more
U||But, Follow me! Nor Peter nor the rest
U||Or gold or silver of Matthias took,
U||When lots were cast upon the forfeit place
U||Of the condemned soul. Abide thou then;
U||Thy punishment of right is merited:
U||And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,
U||Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir’d.
U||If reverence of the keys restrain’d me not,
U||Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet
U||Severer speech might use. Your avarice
U||O’ercasts the world with mourning, under foot
U||Treading the good, and raising bad men up.
U||Of shepherds, like to you, th’ Evangelist
U||Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,
U||With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,
U||She who with seven heads tower’d at her birth,
U||And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,
U||Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.
U||Of gold and silver ye have made your god,
U||Diff’ring wherein from the idolater,
U||But he that worships one, a hundred ye?
U||Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,
U||Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,
U||Which the first wealthy Father gain’d from thee!”
U||Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath
U||Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang
U||Spinning on either sole. I do believe
U||My teacher well was pleas’d, with so compos’d
U||A lip, he listen’d ever to the sound
U||Of the true words I utter’d. In both arms
U||He caught, and to his bosom lifting me
U||Upward retrac’d the way of his descent.
U||Nor weary of his weight he press’d me close,
U||Till to the summit of the rock we came,
U||Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.
U||His cherish’d burden there gently he plac’d
U||Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path
U||Not easy for the clamb’ring goat to mount.
U||Thence to my view another vale appear’d
U||CANTO XX
U||And now the verse proceeds to torments new,
U||Fit argument of this the twentieth strain
U||Of the first song, whose awful theme records
U||The spirits whelm’d in woe. Earnest I look’d
U||Into the depth, that open’d to my view,
U||Moisten’d with tears of anguish, and beheld
U||A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,
U||In silence weeping: such their step as walk
U||Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.
U||As on them more direct mine eye descends,
U||Each wondrously seem’d to be revers’d
U||At the neck-bone, so that the countenance
U||Was from the reins averted: and because
U||None might before him look, they were compell’d
U||To’ advance with backward gait. Thus one perhaps
U||Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos’d,
U||But I ne’er saw it nor believe it so.
U||Now, reader! think within thyself, so God
U||Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long
U||Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld
U||Near me our form distorted in such guise,
U||That on the hinder parts fall’n from the face
U||The tears down-streaming roll’d. Against a rock
U||I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim’d:
U||“What, and art thou too witless as the rest?
U||Here pity most doth show herself alive,
U||When she is dead. What guilt exceedeth his,
U||Who with Heaven’s judgment in his passion strives?
U||Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,
U||Before whose eyes earth gap’d in Thebes, when all
U||Cried out, ‘Amphiaraus, whither rushest?
U||‘Why leavest thou the war?’ He not the less
U||Fell ruining far as to Minos down,
U||Whose grapple none eludes. Lo! how he makes
U||The breast his shoulders, and who once too far
U||Before him wish’d to see, now backward looks,
U||And treads reverse his path. Tiresias note,
U||Who semblance chang’d, when woman he became
U||Of male, through every limb transform’d, and then
U||Once more behov’d him with his rod to strike
U||The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,
U||That mark’d the better sex, might shoot again.
U||“Aruns, with more his belly facing, comes.
U||On Luni’s mountains ’midst the marbles white,
U||Where delves Carrara’s hind, who wons beneath,
U||A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars
U||And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.
U||“The next, whose loosen’d tresses overspread
U||Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair
U||On that side grows) was Manto, she who search’d
U||Through many regions, and at length her seat
U||Fix’d in my native land, whence a short space
U||My words detain thy audience. When her sire
U||From life departed, and in servitude
U||The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn’d,
U||Long time she went a wand’rer through the world.
U||Aloft in Italy’s delightful land
U||A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,
U||That o’er the Tyrol locks Germania in,
U||Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,
U||Methinks, and more, water between the vale
U||Camonica and Garda and the height
U||Of Apennine remote. There is a spot
U||At midway of that lake, where he who bears
U||Of Trento’s flock the past’ral staff, with him
U||Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each
U||Passing that way his benediction give.
U||A garrison of goodly site and strong
U||Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos’d
U||The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore
U||More slope each way descends. There, whatsoev’er
U||Benacus’ bosom holds not, tumbling o’er
U||Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath
U||Through the green pastures. Soon as in his course
U||The steam makes head, Benacus then no more
U||They call the name, but Mincius, till at last
U||Reaching Governo into Po he falls.
U||Not far his course hath run, when a wide flat
U||It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh
U||It covers, pestilent in summer oft.
U||Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw
U||’Midst of the fen a territory waste
U||And naked of inhabitants. To shun
U||All human converse, here she with her slaves
U||Plying her arts remain’d, and liv’d, and left
U||Her body tenantless. Thenceforth the tribes,
U||Who round were scatter’d, gath’ring to that place
U||Assembled; for its strength was great, enclos’d
U||On all parts by the fen. On those dead bones
U||They rear’d themselves a city, for her sake,
U||Calling it Mantua, who first chose the spot,
U||Nor ask’d another omen for the name,
U||Wherein more numerous the people dwelt,
U||Ere Casalodi’s madness by deceit
U||Was wrong’d of Pinamonte. If thou hear
U||Henceforth another origin assign’d
U||Of that my country, I forewarn thee now,
U||That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth.”
U||I answer’d: “Teacher, I conclude thy words
U||So certain, that all else shall be to me
U||As embers lacking life. But now of these,
U||Who here proceed, instruct me, if thou see
U||Any that merit more especial note.
U||For thereon is my mind alone intent.”
U||He straight replied: “That spirit, from whose cheek
U||The beard sweeps o’er his shoulders brown, what time
U||Graecia was emptied of her males, that scarce
U||The cradles were supplied, the seer was he
U||In Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign
U||When first to cut the cable. Him they nam’d
U||Eurypilus: so sings my tragic strain,
U||In which majestic measure well thou know’st,
U||Who know’st it all. That other, round the loins
U||So slender of his shape, was Michael Scot,
U||Practis’d in ev’ry slight of magic wile.
U||“Guido Bonatti see: Asdente mark,
U||Who now were willing, he had tended still
U||The thread and cordwain; and too late repents.
U||“See next the wretches, who the needle left,
U||The shuttle and the spindle, and became
U||Diviners: baneful witcheries they wrought
U||With images and herbs. But onward now:
U||For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
U||On either hemisphere, touching the wave
U||Beneath the towers of Seville. Yesternight
U||The moon was round. Thou mayst remember well:
U||For she good service did thee in the gloom
U||Of the deep wood.” This said, both onward mov’d.
U||CANTO XXI
U||Thus we from bridge to bridge, with other talk,
U||The which my drama cares not to rehearse,
U||Pass’d on; and to the summit reaching, stood
U||To view another gap, within the round
U||Of Malebolge, other bootless pangs.
U||Marvelous darkness shadow’d o’er the place.
U||In the Venetians’ arsenal as boils
U||Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear
U||Their unsound vessels; for th’ inclement time
U||Sea-faring men restrains, and in that while
U||His bark one builds anew, another stops
U||The ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;
U||One hammers at the prow, one at the poop;
U||This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,
U||The mizen one repairs and main-sail rent
U||So not by force of fire but art divine
U||Boil’d here a glutinous thick mass, that round
U||Lim’d all the shore beneath. I that beheld,
U||But therein nought distinguish’d, save the surge,
U||Rais’d by the boiling, in one mighty swell
U||Heave, and by turns subsiding and fall. While there
U||I fix’d my ken below, “Mark! mark!” my guide
U||Exclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,
U||Wherein I stood. I turn’d myself as one,
U||Impatient to behold that which beheld
U||He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,
U||That he his flight delays not for the view.
U||Behind me I discern’d a devil black,
U||That running, up advanc’d along the rock.
U||Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!
U||In act how bitter did he seem, with wings
U||Buoyant outstretch’d and feet of nimblest tread!
U||His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp
U||Was with a sinner charg’d; by either haunch
U||He held him, the foot’s sinew griping fast.
U||“Ye of our bridge!” he cried, “keen-talon’d fiends!
U||Lo! one of Santa Zita’s elders! Him
U||Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more.
U||That land hath store of such. All men are there,
U||Except Bonturo, barterers: of ‘no’
U||For lucre there an ‘aye’ is quickly made.”
U||Him dashing down, o’er the rough rock he turn’d,
U||Nor ever after thief a mastiff loos’d
U||Sped with like eager haste. That other sank
U||And forthwith writhing to the surface rose.
U||But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,
U||Cried “Here the hallow’d visage saves not: here
U||Is other swimming than in Serchio’s wave.
U||Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,
U||Take heed thou mount not o’er the pitch.” This said,
U||They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,
U||And shouted: “Cover’d thou must sport thee here;
U||So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch.”
U||E’en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,
U||To thrust the flesh into the caldron down
U||With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top.
U||Me then my guide bespake: “Lest they descry,
U||That thou art here, behind a craggy rock
U||Bend low and screen thee; and whate’er of force
U||Be offer’d me, or insult, fear thou not:
U||For I am well advis’d, who have been erst
U||In the like fray.” Beyond the bridge’s head
U||Therewith he pass’d, and reaching the sixth pier,
U||Behov’d him then a forehead terror-proof.
U||With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth
U||Upon the poor man’s back, who suddenly
U||From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush’d
U||Those from beneath the arch, and against him
U||Their weapons all they pointed. He aloud:
U||“Be none of you outrageous: ere your time
U||Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,
U||“Who having heard my words, decide he then
U||If he shall tear these limbs.” They shouted loud,
U||“Go, Malacoda!” Whereat one advanc’d,
U||The others standing firm, and as he came,
U||“What may this turn avail him?” he exclaim’d.
U||“Believ’st thou, Malacoda! I had come
U||Thus far from all your skirmishing secure,”
U||My teacher answered, “without will divine
U||And destiny propitious? Pass we then
U||For so Heaven’s pleasure is, that I should lead
U||Another through this savage wilderness.”
U||Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop
U||The instrument of torture at his feet,
U||And to the rest exclaim’d: “We have no power
U||To strike him.” Then to me my guide: “O thou!
U||Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit
U||Low crouching, safely now to me return.”
U||I rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends
U||Meantime all forward drew: me terror seiz’d
U||Lest they should break the compact they had made.
U||Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw
U||Th’ infantry dreading, lest his covenant
U||The foe should break; so close he hemm’d them round.
U||I to my leader’s side adher’d, mine eyes
U||With fixt and motionless observance bent
U||On their unkindly visage. They their hooks
U||Protruding, one the other thus bespake:
U||“Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?” To whom
U||Was answer’d: “Even so; nor miss thy aim.”
U||But he, who was in conf’rence with my guide,
U||Turn’d rapid round, and thus the demon spake:
U||“Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!” Then to us
U||He added: “Further footing to your step
U||This rock affords not, shiver’d to the base
U||Of the sixth arch. But would you still proceed,
U||Up by this cavern go: not distant far,
U||Another rock will yield you passage safe.
U||Yesterday, later by five hours than now,
U||Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill’d
U||The circuit of their course, since here the way
U||Was broken. Thitherward I straight dispatch
U||Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy
U||If any on the surface bask. With them
U||Go ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell.
U||Come Alichino forth,” with that he cried,
U||“And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!
U||The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.
U||With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,
U||Fang’d Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,
U||And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant.
U||Search ye around the bubbling tar. For these,
U||In safety lead them, where the other crag
U||Uninterrupted traverses the dens.”
U||I then: “O master! what a sight is there!
U||Ah! without escort, journey we alone,
U||Which, if thou know the way, I covet not.
U||Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark
U||How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl
U||Threatens us present tortures?” He replied:
U||“I charge thee fear not: let them, as they will,
U||Gnarl on: ’t is but in token of their spite
U||Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep’d.”
U||To leftward o’er the pier they turn’d; but each
U||Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue,
U||Toward their leader for a signal looking,
U||Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave.
U||CANTO XXII
U||It hath been heretofore my chance to see
U||Horsemen with martial order shifting camp,
U||To onset sallying, or in muster rang’d,
U||Or in retreat sometimes outstretch’d for flight;
U||Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers
U||Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen,
U||And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts,
U||Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells,
U||Tabors, or signals made from castled heights,
U||And with inventions multiform, our own,
U||Or introduc’d from foreign land; but ne’er
U||To such a strange recorder I beheld,
U||In evolution moving, horse nor foot,
U||Nor ship, that tack’d by sign from land or star.
U||With the ten demons on our way we went;
U||Ah fearful company! but in the church
U||With saints, with gluttons at the tavern’s mess.
U||Still earnest on the pitch I gaz’d, to mark
U||All things whate’er the chasm contain’d, and those
U||Who burn’d within. As dolphins, that, in sign
U||To mariners, heave high their arched backs,
U||That thence forewarn’d they may advise to save
U||Their threaten’d vessels; so, at intervals,
U||To ease the pain his back some sinner show’d,
U||Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.
U||E’en as the frogs, that of a wat’ry moat
U||Stand at the brink, with the jaws only out,
U||Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed,
U||Thus on each part the sinners stood, but soon
U||As Barbariccia was at hand, so they
U||Drew back under the wave. I saw, and yet
U||My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,
U||As it befalls that oft one frog remains,
U||While the next springs away: and Graffiacan,
U||Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz’d
U||His clotted locks, and dragg’d him sprawling up,
U||That he appear’d to me an otter. Each
U||Already by their names I knew, so well
U||When they were chosen, I observ’d, and mark’d
U||How one the other call’d. “O Rubicant!
U||See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,”
U||Shouted together all the cursed crew.
U||Then I: “Inform thee, master! if thou may,
U||What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand
U||His foes have laid.” My leader to his side
U||Approach’d, and whence he came inquir’d, to whom
U||Was answer’d thus: “Born in Navarre’s domain
U||My mother plac’d me in a lord’s retinue,
U||For she had borne me to a losel vile,
U||A spendthrift of his substance and himself.
U||The good king Thibault after that I serv’d,
U||To peculating here my thoughts were turn’d,
U||Whereof I give account in this dire heat.”
U||Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk
U||Issued on either side, as from a boar,
U||Ript him with one of these. ’Twixt evil claws
U||The mouse had fall’n: but Barbariccia cried,
U||Seizing him with both arms: “Stand thou apart,
U||While I do fix him on my prong transpierc’d.”
U||Then added, turning to my guide his face,
U||“Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,
U||Ere he again be rent.” My leader thus:
U||“Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;
U||Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land
U||Under the tar?”—“I parted,” he replied,
U||“But now from one, who sojourn’d not far thence;
U||So were I under shelter now with him!
U||Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more.”—.
U||“Too long we suffer,” Libicocco cried,
U||Then, darting forth a prong, seiz’d on his arm,
U||And mangled bore away the sinewy part.
U||Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath
U||Would next have caught, whence angrily their chief,
U||Turning on all sides round, with threat’ning brow
U||Restrain’d them. When their strife a little ceas’d,
U||Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,
U||My teacher thus without delay inquir’d:
U||“Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap
U||Parting, as thou has told, thou cam’st to shore?”—
U||“It was the friar Gomita,” he rejoin’d,
U||“He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,
U||Who had his master’s enemies in hand,
U||And us’d them so that they commend him well.
U||Money he took, and them at large dismiss’d.
U||So he reports: and in each other charge
U||Committed to his keeping, play’d the part
U||Of barterer to the height: with him doth herd
U||The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.
U||Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue
U||Is never weary. Out! alas! behold
U||That other, how he grins! More would I say,
U||But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore.”
U||Their captain then to Farfarello turning,
U||Who roll’d his moony eyes in act to strike,
U||Rebuk’d him thus: “Off! cursed bird! Avaunt!”—
U||“If ye desire to see or hear,” he thus
U||Quaking with dread resum’d, “or Tuscan spirits
U||Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear.
U||Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,
U||So that no vengeance they may fear from them,
U||And I, remaining in this self-same place,
U||Will for myself but one, make sev’n appear,
U||When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so
U||Our custom is to call each other up.”
U||Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn’d,
U||Then wagg’d the head and spake: “Hear his device,
U||Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down.”
U||Whereto he thus, who fail’d not in rich store
U||Of nice-wove toils; “Mischief forsooth extreme,
U||Meant only to procure myself more woe!”
U||No longer Alichino then refrain’d,
U||But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:
U||“If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot
U||Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat
U||My plumes. Quit we the vantage ground, and let
U||The bank be as a shield, that we may see
U||If singly thou prevail against us all.”
U||Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!
U||They each one turn’d his eyes to the other shore,
U||He first, who was the hardest to persuade.
U||The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,
U||Planted his feet on land, and at one leap
U||Escaping disappointed their resolve.
U||Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,
U||Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit
U||He therefore sped, exclaiming: “Thou art caught.”
U||But little it avail’d: terror outstripp’d
U||His following flight: the other plung’d beneath,
U||And he with upward pinion rais’d his breast:
U||E’en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives
U||The falcon near, dives instant down, while he
U||Enrag’d and spent retires. That mockery
U||In Calcabrina fury stirr’d, who flew
U||After him, with desire of strife inflam’d;
U||And, for the barterer had ’scap’d, so turn’d
U||His talons on his comrade. O’er the dyke
U||In grapple close they join’d; but the other prov’d
U||A goshawk able to rend well his foe;
U||And in the boiling lake both fell. The heat
U||Was umpire soon between them, but in vain
U||To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued
U||Their pennons. Barbariccia, as the rest,
U||That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch’d
U||From the other coast, with all their weapons arm’d.
U||They, to their post on each side speedily
U||Descending, stretch’d their hooks toward the fiends,
U||Who flounder’d, inly burning from their scars:
U||And we departing left them to that broil.
U||CANTO XXIII
U||In silence and in solitude we went,
U||One first, the other following his steps,
U||As minor friars journeying on their road.
U||The present fray had turn’d my thoughts to muse
U||Upon old Aesop’s fable, where he told
U||What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.
U||For language hath not sounds more like in sense,
U||Than are these chances, if the origin
U||And end of each be heedfully compar’d.
U||And as one thought bursts from another forth,
U||So afterward from that another sprang,
U||Which added doubly to my former fear.
U||For thus I reason’d: “These through us have been
U||So foil’d, with loss and mock’ry so complete,
U||As needs must sting them sore. If anger then
U||Be to their evil will conjoin’d, more fell
U||They shall pursue us, than the savage hound
U||Snatches the leveret, panting ’twixt his jaws.”
U||Already I perceiv’d my hair stand all
U||On end with terror, and look’d eager back.
U||“Teacher,” I thus began, “if speedily
U||Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread
U||Those evil talons. Even now behind
U||They urge us: quick imagination works
U||So forcibly, that I already feel them.”
U||He answer’d: “Were I form’d of leaded glass,
U||I should not sooner draw unto myself
U||Thy outward image, than I now imprint
U||That from within. This moment came thy thoughts
U||Presented before mine, with similar act
U||And count’nance similar, so that from both
U||I one design have fram’d. If the right coast
U||Incline so much, that we may thence descend
U||Into the other chasm, we shall escape
U||Secure from this imagined pursuit.”
U||He had not spoke his purpose to the end,
U||When I from far beheld them with spread wings
U||Approach to take us. Suddenly my guide
U||Caught me, ev’n as a mother that from sleep
U||Is by the noise arous’d, and near her sees
U||The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe
U||And flies ne’er pausing, careful more of him
U||Than of herself, that but a single vest
U||Clings round her limbs. Down from the jutting beach
U||Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,
U||Which closes on one part the other chasm.
U||Never ran water with such hurrying pace
U||Adown the tube to turn a landmill’s wheel,
U||When nearest it approaches to the spokes,
U||As then along that edge my master ran,
U||Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,
U||Not a companion. Scarcely had his feet
U||Reach’d to the lowest of the bed beneath,
U||When over us the steep they reach’d; but fear
U||In him was none; for that high Providence,
U||Which plac’d them ministers of the fifth foss,
U||Power of departing thence took from them all.
U||There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,
U||Who pac’d with tardy steps around, and wept,
U||Faint in appearance and o’ercome with toil.
U||Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down
U||Before their eyes, in fashion like to those
U||Worn by the monks in Cologne. Their outside
U||Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,
U||But leaden all within, and of such weight,
U||That Frederick’s compar’d to these were straw.
U||Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!
U||We yet once more with them together turn’d
U||To leftward, on their dismal moan intent.
U||But by the weight oppress’d, so slowly came
U||The fainting people, that our company
U||Was chang’d at every movement of the step.
U||Whence I my guide address’d: “See that thou find
U||Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,
U||And to that end look round thee as thou go’st.”
U||Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,
U||Cried after us aloud: “Hold in your feet,
U||Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.
U||Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish.”
U||Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:
U||“Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed.”
U||I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look
U||Impatient eagerness of mind was mark’d
U||To overtake me; but the load they bare
U||And narrow path retarded their approach.
U||Soon as arriv’d, they with an eye askance
U||Perus’d me, but spake not: then turning each
U||To other thus conferring said: “This one
U||Seems, by the action of his throat, alive.
U||And, be they dead, what privilege allows
U||They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?”
U||Then thus to me: “Tuscan, who visitest
U||The college of the mourning hypocrites,
U||Disdain not to instruct us who thou art.”
U||“By Arno’s pleasant stream,” I thus replied,
U||“In the great city I was bred and grew,
U||And wear the body I have ever worn.
U||but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,
U||As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?
U||What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?”
U||“Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,”
U||One of them answer’d, “are so leaden gross,
U||That with their weight they make the balances
U||To crack beneath them. Joyous friars we were,
U||Bologna’s natives, Catalano I,
U||He Loderingo nam’d, and by thy land
U||Together taken, as men used to take
U||A single and indifferent arbiter,
U||To reconcile their strifes. How there we sped,
U||Gardingo’s vicinage can best declare.”
U||“O friars!” I began, “your miseries—”
U||But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,
U||Fix’d to a cross with three stakes on the ground:
U||He, when he saw me, writh’d himself, throughout
U||Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard.
U||And Catalano, who thereof was ’ware,
U||Thus spake: “That pierced spirit, whom intent
U||Thou view’st, was he who gave the Pharisees
U||Counsel, that it were fitting for one man
U||To suffer for the people. He doth lie
U||Transverse; nor any passes, but him first
U||Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.
U||In straits like this along the foss are plac’d
U||The father of his consort, and the rest
U||Partakers in that council, seed of ill
U||And sorrow to the Jews.” I noted then,
U||How Virgil gaz’d with wonder upon him,
U||Thus abjectly extended on the cross
U||In banishment eternal. To the friar
U||He next his words address’d: “We pray ye tell,
U||If so be lawful, whether on our right
U||Lies any opening in the rock, whereby
U||We both may issue hence, without constraint
U||On the dark angels, that compell’d they come
U||To lead us from this depth.” He thus replied:
U||“Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock
U||From the next circle moving, which o’ersteps
U||Each vale of horror, save that here his cope
U||Is shatter’d. By the ruin ye may mount:
U||For on the side it slants, and most the height
U||Rises below.” With head bent down awhile
U||My leader stood, then spake: “He warn’d us ill,
U||Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook.”
U||To whom the friar: “At Bologna erst
U||I many vices of the devil heard,
U||Among the rest was said, ‘He is a liar,
U||And the father of lies!’” When he had spoke,
U||My leader with large strides proceeded on,
U||Somewhat disturb’d with anger in his look.
U||I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,
U||And following, his beloved footsteps mark’d.
U||CANTO XXIV
U||In the year’s early nonage, when the sun
U||Tempers his tresses in Aquarius’ urn,
U||And now towards equal day the nights recede,
U||When as the rime upon the earth puts on
U||Her dazzling sister’s image, but not long
U||Her milder sway endures, then riseth up
U||The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,
U||And looking out beholds the plain around
U||All whiten’d, whence impatiently he smites
U||His thighs, and to his hut returning in,
U||There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,
U||As a discomfited and helpless man;
U||Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope
U||Spring in his bosom, finding e’en thus soon
U||The world hath chang’d its count’nance, grasps his crook,
U||And forth to pasture drives his little flock:
U||So me my guide dishearten’d when I saw
U||His troubled forehead, and so speedily
U||That ill was cur’d; for at the fallen bridge
U||Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,
U||He turn’d him back, as that I first beheld
U||At the steep mountain’s foot. Regarding well
U||The ruin, and some counsel first maintain’d
U||With his own thought, he open’d wide his arm
U||And took me up. As one, who, while he works,
U||Computes his labour’s issue, that he seems
U||Still to foresee the effect, so lifting me
U||Up to the summit of one peak, he fix’d
U||His eye upon another. “Grapple that,”
U||Said he, “but first make proof, if it be such
U||As will sustain thee.” For one capp’d with lead
U||This were no journey. Scarcely he, though light,
U||And I, though onward push’d from crag to crag,
U||Could mount. And if the precinct of this coast
U||Were not less ample than the last, for him
U||I know not, but my strength had surely fail’d.
U||But Malebolge all toward the mouth
U||Inclining of the nethermost abyss,
U||The site of every valley hence requires,
U||That one side upward slope, the other fall.
U||At length the point of our descent we reach’d
U||From the last flag: soon as to that arriv’d,
U||So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,
U||I could no further, but did seat me there.
U||“Now needs thy best of man;” so spake my guide:
U||“For not on downy plumes, nor under shade
U||Of canopy reposing, fame is won,
U||Without which whosoe’er consumes his days
U||Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,
U||As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.
U||Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness
U||By the mind’s effort, in each struggle form’d
U||To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight
U||Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.
U||A longer ladder yet remains to scale.
U||From these to have escap’d sufficeth not.
U||If well thou note me, profit by my words.”
U||I straightway rose, and show’d myself less spent
U||Than I in truth did feel me. “On,” I cried,
U||“For I am stout and fearless.” Up the rock
U||Our way we held, more rugged than before,
U||Narrower and steeper far to climb. From talk
U||I ceas’d not, as we journey’d, so to seem
U||Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss
U||Did issue forth, for utt’rance suited ill.
U||Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,
U||What were the words I knew not, but who spake
U||Seem’d mov’d in anger. Down I stoop’d to look,
U||But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
U||For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:
U||“To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,
U||And from the wall dismount we; for as hence
U||I hear and understand not, so I see
U||Beneath, and naught discern.”—“I answer not,”
U||Said he, “but by the deed. To fair request
U||Silent performance maketh best return.”
U||We from the bridge’s head descended, where
U||To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm
U||Opening to view, I saw a crowd within
U||Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape
U||And hideous, that remembrance in my veins
U||Yet shrinks the vital current. Of her sands
U||Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,
U||Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,
U||Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire
U||Or in such numbers swarming ne’er she shew’d,
U||Not with all Ethiopia, and whate’er
U||Above the Erythraean sea is spawn’d.
U||Amid this dread exuberance of woe
U||Ran naked spirits wing’d with horrid fear,
U||Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,
U||Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.
U||With serpents were their hands behind them bound,
U||Which through their reins infix’d the tail and head
U||Twisted in folds before. And lo! on one
U||Near to our side, darted an adder up,
U||And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,
U||Transpierc’d him. Far more quickly than e’er pen
U||Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn’d, and chang’d
U||To ashes, all pour’d out upon the earth.
U||When there dissolv’d he lay, the dust again
U||Uproll’d spontaneous, and the self-same form
U||Instant resumed. So mighty sages tell,
U||The Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years
U||Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith
U||Renascent. Blade nor herb throughout his life
U||He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone
U||And odorous amomum: swaths of nard
U||And myrrh his funeral shroud. As one that falls,
U||He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg’d
U||To earth, or through obstruction fettering up
U||In chains invisible the powers of man,
U||Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,
U||Bewilder’d with the monstrous agony
U||He hath endur’d, and wildly staring sighs;
U||So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.
U||Oh! how severe God’s judgment, that deals out
U||Such blows in stormy vengeance! Who he was
U||My teacher next inquir’d, and thus in few
U||He answer’d: “Vanni Fucci am I call’d,
U||Not long since rained down from Tuscany
U||To this dire gullet. Me the beastial life
U||And not the human pleas’d, mule that I was,
U||Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.”
U||I then to Virgil: “Bid him stir not hence,
U||And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once
U||A man I knew him choleric and bloody.”
U||The sinner heard and feign’d not, but towards me
U||His mind directing and his face, wherein
U||Was dismal shame depictur’d, thus he spake:
U||“It grieves me more to have been caught by thee
U||In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than
U||When I was taken from the other life.
U||I have no power permitted to deny
U||What thou inquirest.” I am doom’d thus low
U||To dwell, for that the sacristy by me
U||Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,
U||And with the guilt another falsely charged.
U||But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,
U||So as thou e’er shalt ’scape this darksome realm
U||Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.
U||Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,
U||Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.
U||From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,
U||A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,
U||And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
U||With arrowy hurtling o’er Piceno’s field,
U||Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike
U||Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.
U||This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart.”
U||CANTO XXV
U||When he had spoke, the sinner rais’d his hands
U||Pointed in mockery, and cried: “Take them, God!
U||I level them at thee!” From that day forth
U||The serpents were my friends; for round his neck
U||One of then rolling twisted, as it said,
U||“Be silent, tongue!” Another to his arms
U||Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself
U||So close, it took from them the power to move.
U||Pistoia! Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt
U||To turn thee into ashes, cumb’ring earth
U||No longer, since in evil act so far
U||Thou hast outdone thy seed? I did not mark,
U||Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss,
U||Spirit, that swell’d so proudly ’gainst his God,
U||Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes. He fled,
U||Nor utter’d more; and after him there came
U||A centaur full of fury, shouting, “Where
U||Where is the caitiff?” On Maremma’s marsh
U||Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch
U||They swarm’d, to where the human face begins.
U||Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,
U||With open wings, a dragon breathing fire
U||On whomsoe’er he met. To me my guide:
U||“Cacus is this, who underneath the rock
U||Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.
U||He, from his brethren parted, here must tread
U||A different journey, for his fraudful theft
U||Of the great herd, that near him stall’d; whence found
U||His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace
U||Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on
U||A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.”
U||While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:
U||And under us three spirits came, of whom
U||Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim’d;
U||“Say who are ye?” We then brake off discourse,
U||Intent on these alone. I knew them not;
U||But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one
U||Had need to name another. “Where,” said he,
U||“Doth Cianfa lurk?” I, for a sign my guide
U||Should stand attentive, plac’d against my lips
U||The finger lifted. If, O reader! now
U||Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,
U||No marvel; for myself do scarce allow
U||The witness of mine eyes. But as I looked
U||Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet
U||Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:
U||His midmost grasp’d the belly, a forefoot
U||Seiz’d on each arm (while deep in either cheek
U||He flesh’d his fangs); the hinder on the thighs
U||Were spread, ’twixt which the tail inserted curl’d
U||Upon the reins behind. Ivy ne’er clasp’d
U||A dodder’d oak, as round the other’s limbs
U||The hideous monster intertwin’d his own.
U||Then, as they both had been of burning wax,
U||Each melted into other, mingling hues,
U||That which was either now was seen no more.
U||Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,
U||A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,
U||And the clean white expires. The other two
U||Look’d on exclaiming: “Ah, how dost thou change,
U||Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now,
U||“Nor only one.” The two heads now became
U||One, and two figures blended in one form
U||Appear’d, where both were lost. Of the four lengths
U||Two arms were made: the belly and the chest
U||The thighs and legs into such members chang’d,
U||As never eye hath seen. Of former shape
U||All trace was vanish’d. Two yet neither seem’d
U||That image miscreate, and so pass’d on
U||With tardy steps. As underneath the scourge
U||Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,
U||Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems
U||A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,
U||So toward th’ entrails of the other two
U||Approaching seem’d, an adder all on fire,
U||As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.
U||In that part, whence our life is nourish’d first,
U||One he transpierc’d; then down before him fell
U||Stretch’d out. The pierced spirit look’d on him
U||But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn’d,
U||As if by sleep or fev’rous fit assail’d.
U||He ey’d the serpent, and the serpent him.
U||One from the wound, the other from the mouth
U||Breath’d a thick smoke, whose vap’ry columns join’d.
U||Lucan in mute attention now may hear,
U||Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,
U||Nor shine, Nasidius! Ovid now be mute.
U||What if in warbling fiction he record
U||Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake
U||Him chang’d, and her into a fountain clear,
U||I envy not; for never face to face
U||Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,
U||Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
U||The other’s substance. They in mutual guise
U||So answer’d, that the serpent split his train
U||Divided to a fork, and the pierc’d spirit
U||Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs
U||Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon
U||Was visible: the tail disparted took
U||The figure which the spirit lost, its skin
U||Soft’ning, his indurated to a rind.
U||The shoulders next I mark’d, that ent’ring join’d
U||The monster’s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet
U||So lengthen’d, as the other’s dwindling shrunk.
U||The feet behind then twisting up became
U||That part that man conceals, which in the wretch
U||Was cleft in twain. While both the shadowy smoke
U||With a new colour veils, and generates
U||Th’ excrescent pile on one, peeling it off
U||From th’ other body, lo! upon his feet
U||One upright rose, and prone the other fell.
U||Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
U||Were shifted, though each feature chang’d beneath.
U||Of him who stood erect, the mounting face
U||Retreated towards the temples, and what there
U||Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears
U||From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg’d,
U||Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell’d
U||Into due size protuberant the lips.
U||He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends
U||His sharpen’d visage, and draws down the ears
U||Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.
U||His tongue continuous before and apt
U||For utt’rance, severs; and the other’s fork
U||Closing unites. That done the smoke was laid.
U||The soul, transform’d into the brute, glides off,
U||Hissing along the vale, and after him
U||The other talking sputters; but soon turn’d
U||His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few
U||Thus to another spake: “Along this path
U||Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!”
U||So saw I fluctuate in successive change
U||Th’ unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:
U||And here if aught my tongue have swerv’d, events
U||So strange may be its warrant. O’er mine eyes
U||Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.
U||Yet ’scap’d they not so covertly, but well
U||I mark’d Sciancato: he alone it was
U||Of the three first that came, who chang’d not: thou,
U||The other’s fate, Gaville, still dost rue.
U||CANTO XXVI
U||Florence exult! for thou so mightily
U||Hast thriven, that o’er land and sea thy wings
U||Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!
U||Among the plund’rers such the three I found
U||Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,
U||And no proud honour to thyself redounds.
U||But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,
U||Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long
U||Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)
U||Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance
U||Were in good time, if it befell thee now.
U||Would so it were, since it must needs befall!
U||For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.
U||We from the depth departed; and my guide
U||Remounting scal’d the flinty steps, which late
U||We downward trac’d, and drew me up the steep.
U||Pursuing thus our solitary way
U||Among the crags and splinters of the rock,
U||Sped not our feet without the help of hands.
U||Then sorrow seiz’d me, which e’en now revives,
U||As my thought turns again to what I saw,
U||And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb
U||The powers of nature in me, lest they run
U||Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good
U||My gentle star, or something better gave me,
U||I envy not myself the precious boon.
U||As in that season, when the sun least veils
U||His face that lightens all, what time the fly
U||Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then
U||Upon some cliff reclin’d, beneath him sees
U||Fire-flies innumerous spangling o’er the vale,
U||Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:
U||With flames so numberless throughout its space
U||Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth
U||Was to my view expos’d. As he, whose wrongs
U||The bears aveng’d, at its departure saw
U||Elijah’s chariot, when the steeds erect
U||Rais’d their steep flight for heav’n; his eyes meanwhile,
U||Straining pursu’d them, till the flame alone
U||Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn’d;
U||E’en thus along the gulf moves every flame,
U||A sinner so enfolded close in each,
U||That none exhibits token of the theft.
U||Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,
U||And grasp’d a flinty mass, or else had fall’n,
U||Though push’d not from the height. The guide, who mark’d
U||How I did gaze attentive, thus began:
U||“Within these ardours are the spirits, each
U||Swath’d in confining fire.”—“Master, thy word,”
U||I answer’d, “hath assur’d me; yet I deem’d
U||Already of the truth, already wish’d
U||To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes
U||So parted at the summit, as it seem’d
U||Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay
U||The Theban brothers?” He replied: “Within
U||Ulysses there and Diomede endure
U||Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now
U||Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath.
U||These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
U||The ambush of the horse, that open’d wide
U||A portal for that goodly seed to pass,
U||Which sow’d imperial Rome; nor less the guile
U||Lament they, whence of her Achilles ’reft
U||Deidamia yet in death complains.
U||And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy
U||Of her Palladium spoil’d.”—“If they have power
U||Of utt’rance from within these sparks,” said I,
U||“O master! think my prayer a thousand fold
U||In repetition urg’d, that thou vouchsafe
U||To pause, till here the horned flame arrive.
U||See, how toward it with desire I bend.”
U||He thus: “Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,
U||And I accept it therefore: but do thou
U||Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,
U||For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,
U||For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee.”
U||When there the flame had come, where time and place
U||Seem’d fitting to my guide, he thus began:
U||“O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!
U||If living I of you did merit aught,
U||Whate’er the measure were of that desert,
U||When in the world my lofty strain I pour’d,
U||Move ye not on, till one of you unfold
U||In what clime death o’ertook him self-destroy’d.”
U||Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
U||Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire
U||That labours with the wind, then to and fro
U||Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,
U||Threw out its voice, and spake: “When I escap’d
U||From Circe, who beyond a circling year
U||Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,
U||Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam’d the shore,
U||Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
U||Of my old father, nor return of love,
U||That should have crown’d Penelope with joy,
U||Could overcome in me the zeal I had
U||T’ explore the world, and search the ways of life,
U||Man’s evil and his virtue. Forth I sail’d
U||Into the deep illimitable main,
U||With but one bark, and the small faithful band
U||That yet cleav’d to me. As Iberia far,
U||Far as Morocco either shore I saw,
U||And the Sardinian and each isle beside
U||Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age
U||Were I and my companions, when we came
U||To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain’d
U||The bound’ries not to be o’erstepp’d by man.
U||The walls of Seville to my right I left,
U||On the other hand already Ceuta past.
U||“O brothers!” I began, “who to the west
U||Through perils without number now have reach’d,
U||To this the short remaining watch, that yet
U||Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof
U||Of the unpeopled world, following the track
U||Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:
U||Ye were not form’d to live the life of brutes
U||But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.”
U||With these few words I sharpen’d for the voyage
U||The mind of my associates, that I then
U||Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn
U||Our poop we turn’d, and for the witless flight
U||Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.
U||Each star of the other pole night now beheld,
U||And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor
U||It rose not. Five times re-illum’d, as oft
U||Vanish’d the light from underneath the moon
U||Since the deep way we enter’d, when from far
U||Appear’d a mountain dim, loftiest methought
U||Of all I e’er beheld. Joy seiz’d us straight,
U||But soon to mourning changed. From the new land
U||A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side
U||Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirl’d her round
U||With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up
U||The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:
U||And over us the booming billow clos’d.”
U||CANTO XVII
U||Now upward rose the flame, and still’d its light
U||To speak no more, and now pass’d on with leave
U||From the mild poet gain’d, when following came
U||Another, from whose top a sound confus’d,
U||Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.
U||As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully
U||His cries first echoed, who had shap’d its mould,
U||Did so rebellow, with the voice of him
U||Tormented, that the brazen monster seem’d
U||Pierc’d through with pain; thus while no way they found
U||Nor avenue immediate through the flame,
U||Into its language turn’d the dismal words:
U||But soon as they had won their passage forth,
U||Up from the point, which vibrating obey’d
U||Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:
U||“O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!
U||That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,
U||‘Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,’
U||Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive
U||Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,
U||And with me parley: lo! it irks not me
U||And yet I burn. If but e’en now thou fall
U||into this blind world, from that pleasant land
U||Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,
U||Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,
U||Have peace or war. For of the mountains there
U||Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height,
U||Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood.”
U||Leaning I listen’d yet with heedful ear,
U||When, as he touch’d my side, the leader thus:
U||“Speak thou: he is a Latian.” My reply
U||Was ready, and I spake without delay:
U||“O spirit! who art hidden here below!
U||Never was thy Romagna without war
U||In her proud tyrants’ bosoms, nor is now:
U||But open war there left I none. The state,
U||Ravenna hath maintain’d this many a year,
U||Is steadfast. There Polenta’s eagle broods,
U||And in his broad circumference of plume
U||O’ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp
U||The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,
U||And pil’d in bloody heap the host of France.
U||“The old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,
U||That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,
U||Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs.
U||“Lamone’s city and Santerno’s range
U||Under the lion of the snowy lair.
U||Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,
U||Or ever summer yields to winter’s frost.
U||And she, whose flank is wash’d of Savio’s wave,
U||As ’twixt the level and the steep she lies,
U||Lives so ’twixt tyrant power and liberty.
U||“Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?
U||Be not more hard than others. In the world,
U||So may thy name still rear its forehead high.”
U||Then roar’d awhile the fire, its sharpen’d point
U||On either side wav’d, and thus breath’d at last:
U||“If I did think, my answer were to one,
U||Who ever could return unto the world,
U||This flame should rest unshaken. But since ne’er,
U||If true be told me, any from this depth
U||Has found his upward way, I answer thee,
U||Nor fear lest infamy record the words.
U||“A man of arms at first, I cloth’d me then
U||In good Saint Francis’ girdle, hoping so
U||T’ have made amends. And certainly my hope
U||Had fail’d not, but that he, whom curses light on,
U||The high priest again seduc’d me into sin.
U||And how and wherefore listen while I tell.
U||Long as this spirit mov’d the bones and pulp
U||My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake
U||The nature of the lion than the fox.
U||All ways of winding subtlety I knew,
U||And with such art conducted, that the sound
U||Reach’d the world’s limit. Soon as to that part
U||Of life I found me come, when each behoves
U||To lower sails and gather in the lines;
U||That which before had pleased me then I rued,
U||And to repentance and confession turn’d;
U||Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!
U||The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,
U||Waging his warfare near the Lateran,
U||Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes
U||All Christians were, nor against Acre one
U||Had fought, nor traffic’d in the Soldan’s land),
U||He his great charge nor sacred ministry
U||In himself, rev’renc’d, nor in me that cord,
U||Which us’d to mark with leanness whom it girded.
U||As in Socrate, Constantine besought
U||To cure his leprosy Sylvester’s aid,
U||So me to cure the fever of his pride
U||This man besought: my counsel to that end
U||He ask’d: and I was silent: for his words
U||Seem’d drunken: but forthwith he thus resum’d:
U||“From thy heart banish fear: of all offence
U||I hitherto absolve thee. In return,
U||Teach me my purpose so to execute,
U||That Penestrino cumber earth no more.
U||Heav’n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut
U||And open: and the keys are therefore twain,
U||The which my predecessor meanly priz’d.”
U||Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,
U||Of silence as more perilous I deem’d,
U||And answer’d: “Father! since thou washest me
U||Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,
U||Large promise with performance scant, be sure,
U||Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.”
U||“When I was number’d with the dead, then came
U||Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark
U||He met, who cried: “‘Wrong me not; he is mine,
U||And must below to join the wretched crew,
U||For the deceitful counsel which he gave.
U||E’er since I watch’d him, hov’ring at his hair,
U||No power can the impenitent absolve;
U||Nor to repent and will at once consist,
U||By contradiction absolute forbid.”
U||Oh mis’ry! how I shook myself, when he
U||Seiz’d me, and cried, “Thou haply thought’st me not
U||A disputant in logic so exact.”
U||To Minos down he bore me, and the judge
U||Twin’d eight times round his callous back the tail,
U||Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:
U||‘This is a guilty soul, that in the fire
U||Must vanish.’ Hence perdition-doom’d I rove
U||A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb.”
U||When he had thus fulfill’d his words, the flame
U||In dolour parted, beating to and fro,
U||And writhing its sharp horn. We onward went,
U||I and my leader, up along the rock,
U||Far as another arch, that overhangs
U||The foss, wherein the penalty is paid
U||Of those, who load them with committed sin.
U||CANTO XXVIII
U||Who, e’en in words unfetter’d, might at full
U||Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,
U||Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue
U||So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought
U||Both impotent alike. If in one band
U||Collected, stood the people all, who e’er
U||Pour’d on Apulia’s happy soil their blood,
U||Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war
U||When of the rings the measur’d booty made
U||A pile so high, as Rome’s historian writes
U||Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt
U||The grinding force of Guiscard’s Norman steel,
U||And those the rest, whose bones are gather’d yet
U||At Ceperano, there where treachery
U||Branded th’ Apulian name, or where beyond
U||Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms
U||The old Alardo conquer’d; and his limbs
U||One were to show transpierc’d, another his
U||Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this
U||Were but a thing of nought, to the hideous sight
U||Of the ninth chasm. A rundlet, that hath lost
U||Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,
U||As one I mark’d, torn from the chin throughout
U||Down to the hinder passage: ’twixt the legs
U||Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay
U||Open to view, and wretched ventricle,
U||That turns th’ englutted aliment to dross.
U||Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,
U||He ey’d me, with his hands laid his breast bare,
U||And cried; “Now mark how I do rip me! lo!
U||“How is Mohammed mangled! before me
U||Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face
U||Cleft to the forelock; and the others all
U||Whom here thou seest, while they liv’d, did sow
U||Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.
U||A fiend is here behind, who with his sword
U||Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again
U||Each of this ream, when we have compast round
U||The dismal way, for first our gashes close
U||Ere we repass before him. But say who
U||Art thou, that standest musing on the rock,
U||Haply so lingering to delay the pain
U||Sentenc’d upon thy crimes?”—“Him death not yet,”
U||My guide rejoin’d, “hath overta’en, nor sin
U||Conducts to torment; but, that he may make
U||Full trial of your state, I who am dead
U||Must through the depths of hell, from orb to orb,
U||Conduct him. Trust my words, for they are true.”
U||More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,
U||Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,
U||Forgetful of their pangs. “Thou, who perchance
U||Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou
U||Bear to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not
U||Here soon to follow me, that with good store
U||Of food he arm him, lest impris’ning snows
U||Yield him a victim to Novara’s power,
U||No easy conquest else.” With foot uprais’d
U||For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground
U||Then fix’d it to depart. Another shade,
U||Pierc’d in the throat, his nostrils mutilate
U||E’en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear
U||Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood
U||Gazing, before the rest advanc’d, and bar’d
U||His wind-pipe, that without was all o’ersmear’d
U||With crimson stain. “O thou!” said ‘he, “whom sin
U||Condemns not, and whom erst (unless too near
U||Resemblance do deceive me) I aloft
U||Have seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind
U||Piero of Medicina, if again
U||Returning, thou behold’st the pleasant land
U||That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo;
U||“And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts
U||Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,
U||That if ’t is giv’n us here to scan aright
U||The future, they out of life’s tenement
U||Shall be cast forth, and whelm’d under the waves
U||Near to Cattolica, through perfidy
U||Of a fell tyrant. ’Twixt the Cyprian isle
U||And Balearic, ne’er hath Neptune seen
U||An injury so foul, by pirates done
U||Or Argive crew of old. That one-ey’d traitor
U||(Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain
U||His eye had still lack’d sight of) them shall bring
U||To conf’rence with him, then so shape his end,
U||That they shall need not ’gainst Focara’s wind
U||Offer up vow nor pray’r.” I answering thus:
U||“Declare, as thou dost wish that I above
U||May carry tidings of thee, who is he,
U||In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?”
U||Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone
U||Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws
U||Expanding, cried: “Lo! this is he I wot of;
U||He speaks not for himself: the outcast this
U||Who overwhelm’d the doubt in Caesar’s mind,
U||Affirming that delay to men prepar’d
U||Was ever harmful. “Oh how terrified
U||Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut
U||The tongue, which spake that hardy word. Then one
U||Maim’d of each hand, uplifted in the gloom
U||The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots
U||Sullied his face, and cried: ‘Remember thee
U||Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim’d,
U||“The deed once done there is an end,” that prov’d
U||A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.”
U||I added: “Ay, and death to thine own tribe.”
U||Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,
U||As one grief-stung to madness. But I there
U||Still linger’d to behold the troop, and saw
U||Things, such as I may fear without more proof
U||To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,
U||The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate
U||Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within
U||And bids him on and fear not. Without doubt
U||I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,
U||A headless trunk, that even as the rest
U||Of the sad flock pac’d onward. By the hair
U||It bore the sever’d member, lantern-wise
U||Pendent in hand, which look’d at us and said,
U||“Woe’s me!” The spirit lighted thus himself,
U||And two there were in one, and one in two.
U||How that may be he knows who ordereth so.
U||When at the bridge’s foot direct he stood,
U||His arm aloft he rear’d, thrusting the head
U||Full in our view, that nearer we might hear
U||The words, which thus it utter’d: “Now behold
U||This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go’st
U||To spy the dead; behold if any else
U||Be terrible as this. And that on earth
U||Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I
U||Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John
U||The counsel mischievous. Father and son
U||I set at mutual war. For Absalom
U||And David more did not Ahitophel,
U||Spurring them on maliciously to strife.
U||For parting those so closely knit, my brain
U||Parted, alas! I carry from its source,
U||That in this trunk inhabits. Thus the law
U||Of retribution fiercely works in me.”
U||CANTO XXIX
U||So were mine eyes inebriate with view
U||Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds
U||Disfigur’d, that they long’d to stay and weep.
U||But Virgil rous’d me: “What yet gazest on?
U||Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below
U||Among the maim’d and miserable shades?
U||Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside
U||This weakness. Know, if thou wouldst number them
U||That two and twenty miles the valley winds
U||Its circuit, and already is the moon
U||Beneath our feet: the time permitted now
U||Is short, and more not seen remains to see.”
U||“If thou,” I straight replied, “hadst weigh’d the cause
U||For which I look’d, thou hadst perchance excus’d
U||The tarrying still.” My leader part pursu’d
U||His way, the while I follow’d, answering him,
U||And adding thus: “Within that cave I deem,
U||Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,
U||There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,
U||Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear.”
U||Then spake my master: “Let thy soul no more
U||Afflict itself for him. Direct elsewhere
U||Its thought, and leave him. At the bridge’s foot
U||I mark’d how he did point with menacing look
U||At thee, and heard him by the others nam’d
U||Geri of Bello. Thou so wholly then
U||Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul’d
U||The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not
U||That way, ere he was gone.”—“O guide belov’d!
U||His violent death yet unaveng’d,” said I,
U||“By any, who are partners in his shame,
U||Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,
U||He pass’d me speechless by; and doing so
U||Hath made me more compassionate his fate.”
U||So we discours’d to where the rock first show’d
U||The other valley, had more light been there,
U||E’en to the lowest depth. Soon as we came
U||O’er the last cloister in the dismal rounds
U||Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood
U||Were to our view expos’d, then many a dart
U||Of sore lament assail’d me, headed all
U||With points of thrilling pity, that I clos’d
U||Both ears against the volley with mine hands.
U||As were the torment, if each lazar-house
U||Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time
U||’Twixt July and September, with the isle
U||Sardinia and Maremma’s pestilent fen,
U||Had heap’d their maladies all in one foss
U||Together; such was here the torment: dire
U||The stench, as issuing steams from fester’d limbs.
U||We on the utmost shore of the long rock
U||Descended still to leftward. Then my sight
U||Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein
U||The minister of the most mighty Lord,
U||All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment
U||The forgers noted on her dread record.
U||More rueful was it not methinks to see
U||The nation in Aegina droop, what time
U||Each living thing, e’en to the little worm,
U||All fell, so full of malice was the air
U||(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,
U||The ancient people were restor’d anew
U||From seed of emmets) than was here to see
U||The spirits, that languish’d through the murky vale
U||Up-pil’d on many a stack. Confus’d they lay,
U||One o’er the belly, o’er the shoulders one
U||Roll’d of another; sideling crawl’d a third
U||Along the dismal pathway. Step by step
U||We journey’d on, in silence looking round
U||And list’ning those diseas’d, who strove in vain
U||To lift their forms. Then two I mark’d, that sat
U||Propp’d ’gainst each other, as two brazen pans
U||Set to retain the heat. From head to foot,
U||A tetter bark’d them round. Nor saw I e’er
U||Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord
U||Impatient waited, or himself perchance
U||Tir’d with long watching, as of these each one
U||Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness
U||Of ne’er abated pruriency. The crust
U||Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales
U||Scrap’d from the bream or fish of broader mail.
U||“O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off
U||Thy coat of proof,” thus spake my guide to one,
U||“And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,
U||Tell me if any born of Latian land
U||Be among these within: so may thy nails
U||Serve thee for everlasting to this toil.”
U||“Both are of Latium,” weeping he replied,
U||“Whom tortur’d thus thou seest: but who art thou
U||That hast inquir’d of us?” To whom my guide:
U||“One that descend with this man, who yet lives,
U||From rock to rock, and show him hell’s abyss.”
U||Then started they asunder, and each turn’d
U||Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear
U||Those words redounding struck. To me my liege
U||Address’d him: “Speak to them whate’er thou list.”
U||And I therewith began: “So may no time
U||Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men
U||In th’ upper world, but after many suns
U||Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,
U||And of what race ye come. Your punishment,
U||Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,
U||Deter you not from opening thus much to me.”
U||“Arezzo was my dwelling,” answer’d one,
U||“And me Albero of Sienna brought
U||To die by fire; but that, for which I died,
U||Leads me not here. True is in sport I told him,
U||That I had learn’d to wing my flight in air.
U||And he admiring much, as he was void
U||Of wisdom, will’d me to declare to him
U||The secret of mine art: and only hence,
U||Because I made him not a Daedalus,
U||Prevail’d on one suppos’d his sire to burn me.
U||But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,
U||For that I practis’d alchemy on earth,
U||Has doom’d me. Him no subterfuge eludes.”
U||Then to the bard I spake: “Was ever race
U||Light as Sienna’s? Sure not France herself
U||Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain.”
U||The other leprous spirit heard my words,
U||And thus return’d: “Be Stricca from this charge
U||Exempted, he who knew so temp’rately
U||To lay out fortune’s gifts; and Niccolo
U||Who first the spice’s costly luxury
U||Discover’d in that garden, where such seed
U||Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop
U||Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano
U||Lavish’d his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,
U||And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show’d
U||A spectacle for all. That thou mayst know
U||Who seconds thee against the Siennese
U||Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen’d sight,
U||That well my face may answer to thy ken;
U||So shalt thou see I am Capocchio’s ghost,
U||Who forg’d transmuted metals by the power
U||Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,
U||Thus needs must well remember how I aped
U||Creative nature by my subtle art.”
U||CANTO XXX
U||What time resentment burn’d in Juno’s breast
U||For Semele against the Theban blood,
U||As more than once in dire mischance was rued,
U||Such fatal frenzy seiz’d on Athamas,
U||That he his spouse beholding with a babe
U||Laden on either arm, “Spread out,” he cried,
U||“The meshes, that I take the lioness
U||And the young lions at the pass:” then forth
U||Stretch’d he his merciless talons, grasping one,
U||One helpless innocent, Learchus nam’d,
U||Whom swinging down he dash’d upon a rock,
U||And with her other burden self-destroy’d
U||The hapless mother plung’d: and when the pride
U||Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,
U||By fortune overwhelm’d, and the old king
U||With his realm perish’d, then did Hecuba,
U||A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw
U||Polyxena first slaughter’d, and her son,
U||Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach
U||Next met the mourner’s view, then reft of sense
U||Did she run barking even as a dog;
U||Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.
U||Bet ne’er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy
U||With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads
U||Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,
U||As now two pale and naked ghost I saw
U||That gnarling wildly scamper’d, like the swine
U||Excluded from his stye. One reach’d Capocchio,
U||And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,
U||Dragg’d him, that o’er the solid pavement rubb’d
U||His belly stretch’d out prone. The other shape,
U||He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;
U||“That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood
U||Of random mischief vents he still his spite.”
U||To whom I answ’ring: “Oh! as thou dost hope,
U||The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,
U||Be patient to inform us, who it is,
U||Ere it speed hence.”—“That is the ancient soul
U||Of wretched Myrrha,” he replied, “who burn’d
U||With most unholy flame for her own sire,
U||“And a false shape assuming, so perform’d
U||The deed of sin; e’en as the other there,
U||That onward passes, dar’d to counterfeit
U||Donati’s features, to feign’d testament
U||The seal affixing, that himself might gain,
U||For his own share, the lady of the herd.”
U||When vanish’d the two furious shades, on whom
U||Mine eye was held, I turn’d it back to view
U||The other cursed spirits. One I saw
U||In fashion like a lute, had but the groin
U||Been sever’d, where it meets the forked part.
U||Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs
U||With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch
U||Suits not the visage, open’d wide his lips
U||Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,
U||One towards the chin, the other upward curl’d.
U||“O ye, who in this world of misery,
U||Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,”
U||Thus he began, “attentively regard
U||Adamo’s woe. When living, full supply
U||Ne’er lack’d me of what most I coveted;
U||One drop of water now, alas! I crave.
U||The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes
U||Of Casentino, making fresh and soft
U||The banks whereby they glide to Arno’s stream,
U||Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;
U||For more the pictur’d semblance dries me up,
U||Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh
U||Desert these shrivel’d cheeks. So from the place,
U||Where I transgress’d, stern justice urging me,
U||Takes means to quicken more my lab’ring sighs.
U||There is Romena, where I falsified
U||The metal with the Baptist’s form imprest,
U||For which on earth I left my body burnt.
U||But if I here might see the sorrowing soul
U||Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,
U||For Branda’s limpid spring I would not change
U||The welcome sight. One is e’en now within,
U||If truly the mad spirits tell, that round
U||Are wand’ring. But wherein besteads me that?
U||My limbs are fetter’d. Were I but so light,
U||That I each hundred years might move one inch,
U||I had set forth already on this path,
U||Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,
U||Although eleven miles it wind, not more
U||Than half of one across. They brought me down
U||Among this tribe; induc’d by them I stamp’d
U||The florens with three carats of alloy.”
U||“Who are that abject pair,” I next inquir’d,
U||“That closely bounding thee upon thy right
U||Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep’d
U||In the chill stream?”—“When to this gulf I dropt,”
U||He answer’d, “here I found them; since that hour
U||They have not turn’d, nor ever shall, I ween,
U||Till time hath run his course. One is that dame
U||The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;
U||Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy.
U||Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,
U||In such a cloud upsteam’d.” When that he heard,
U||One, gall’d perchance to be so darkly nam’d,
U||With clench’d hand smote him on the braced paunch,
U||That like a drum resounded: but forthwith
U||Adamo smote him on the face, the blow
U||Returning with his arm, that seem’d as hard.
U||“Though my o’erweighty limbs have ta’en from me
U||The power to move,” said he, “I have an arm
U||At liberty for such employ.” To whom
U||Was answer’d: “When thou wentest to the fire,
U||Thou hadst it not so ready at command,
U||Then readier when it coin’d th’ impostor gold.”
U||And thus the dropsied: “Ay, now speak’st thou true.
U||But there thou gav’st not such true testimony,
U||When thou wast question’d of the truth, at Troy.”
U||“If I spake false, thou falsely stamp’dst the coin,”
U||Said Sinon; “I am here but for one fault,
U||And thou for more than any imp beside.”
U||“Remember,” he replied, “O perjur’d one,
U||The horse remember, that did teem with death,
U||And all the world be witness to thy guilt.”
U||“To thine,” return’d the Greek, “witness the thirst
U||Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,
U||Rear’d by thy belly up before thine eyes,
U||A mass corrupt.” To whom the coiner thus:
U||“Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass
U||Its evil saying. Me if thirst assails,
U||Yet I am stuff’d with moisture. Thou art parch’d,
U||Pains rack thy head, no urging would’st thou need
U||To make thee lap Narcissus’ mirror up.”
U||I was all fix’d to listen, when my guide
U||Admonish’d: “Now beware: a little more,
U||And I do quarrel with thee.” I perceiv’d
U||How angrily he spake, and towards him turn’d
U||With shame so poignant, as remember’d yet
U||Confounds me. As a man that dreams of harm
U||Befall’n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,
U||And that which is, desires as if it were not,
U||Such then was I, who wanting power to speak
U||Wish’d to excuse myself, and all the while
U||Excus’d me, though unweeting that I did.
U||“More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,”
U||My master cried, “might expiate. Therefore cast
U||All sorrow from thy soul; and if again
U||Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,
U||Think I am ever at thy side. To hear
U||Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds.”
U||CANTO XXXI
U||The very tongue, whose keen reproof before
U||Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain’d,
U||Now minister’d my cure. So have I heard,
U||Achilles and his father’s javelin caus’d
U||Pain first, and then the boon of health restor’d.
U||Turning our back upon the vale of woe,
U||W cross’d th’ encircled mound in silence. There
U||Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom
U||Mine eye advanc’d not: but I heard a horn
U||Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made
U||The thunder feeble. Following its course
U||The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent
U||On that one spot. So terrible a blast
U||Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout
U||O’erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench’d
U||His saintly warfare. Thitherward not long
U||My head was rais’d, when many lofty towers
U||Methought I spied. “Master,” said I, “what land
U||Is this?” He answer’d straight: “Too long a space
U||Of intervening darkness has thine eye
U||To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err’d
U||In thy imagining. Thither arriv’d
U||Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude
U||The sense. A little therefore urge thee on.”
U||Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;
U||“Yet know,” said he, “ere farther we advance,
U||That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,
U||But giants. In the pit they stand immers’d,
U||Each from his navel downward, round the bank.”
U||As when a fog disperseth gradually,
U||Our vision traces what the mist involves
U||Condens’d in air; so piercing through the gross
U||And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more
U||We near’d toward the brink, mine error fled,
U||And fear came o’er me. As with circling round
U||Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,
U||E’en thus the shore, encompassing th’ abyss,
U||Was turreted with giants, half their length
U||Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav’n
U||Yet threatens, when his mutt’ring thunder rolls.
U||Of one already I descried the face,
U||Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge
U||Great part, and both arms down along his ribs.
U||All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand
U||Left framing of these monsters, did display
U||Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War
U||Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she
U||Repent her not of th’ elephant and whale,
U||Who ponders well confesses her therein
U||Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force
U||And evil will are back’d with subtlety,
U||Resistance none avails. His visage seem’d
U||In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops
U||Saint Peter’s Roman fane; and th’ other bones
U||Of like proportion, so that from above
U||The bank, which girdled him below, such height
U||Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders
U||Had striv’n in vain to reach but to his hair.
U||Full thirty ample palms was he expos’d
U||Downward from whence a man his garments loops.
U||“Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,”
U||So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns
U||Became not; and my guide address’d him thus:
U||“O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee
U||Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage
U||Or other passion wring thee. Search thy neck,
U||There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.
U||Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast
U||Where hangs the baldrick!” Then to me he spake:
U||“He doth accuse himself. Nimrod is this,
U||Through whose ill counsel in the world no more
U||One tongue prevails. But pass we on, nor waste
U||Our words; for so each language is to him,
U||As his to others, understood by none.”
U||Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,
U||And at a sling’s throw found another shade
U||Far fiercer and more huge. I cannot say
U||What master hand had girt him; but he held
U||Behind the right arm fetter’d, and before
U||The other with a chain, that fasten’d him
U||From the neck down, and five times round his form
U||Apparent met the wreathed links. “This proud one
U||Would of his strength against almighty Jove
U||Make trial,” said my guide; “whence he is thus
U||Requited: Ephialtes him they call.
U||“Great was his prowess, when the giants brought
U||Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,
U||Now moves he never.” Forthwith I return’d:
U||“Fain would I, if ’t were possible, mine eyes
U||Of Briareus immeasurable gain’d
U||Experience next.” He answer’d: “Thou shalt see
U||Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks
U||And is unfetter’d, who shall place us there
U||Where guilt is at its depth. Far onward stands
U||Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made
U||Like to this spirit, save that in his looks
U||More fell he seems.” By violent earthquake rock’d
U||Ne’er shook a tow’r, so reeling to its base,
U||As Ephialtes. More than ever then
U||I dreaded death, nor than the terror more
U||Had needed, if I had not seen the cords
U||That held him fast. We, straightway journeying on,
U||Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete
U||Without the head, forth issued from the cave.
U||“O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made
U||Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword
U||Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,
U||Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
U||An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought
U||In the high conflict on thy brethren’s side,
U||Seems as men yet believ’d, that through thine arm
U||The sons of earth had conquer’d, now vouchsafe
U||To place us down beneath, where numbing cold
U||Locks up Cocytus. Force not that we crave
U||Or Tityus’ help or Typhon’s. Here is one
U||Can give what in this realm ye covet. Stoop
U||Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip.
U||He in the upper world can yet bestow
U||Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks
U||For life yet longer, if before the time
U||Grace call him not unto herself.” Thus spake
U||The teacher. He in haste forth stretch’d his hands,
U||And caught my guide. Alcides whilom felt
U||That grapple straighten’d score. Soon as my guide
U||Had felt it, he bespake me thus: “This way
U||That I may clasp thee;” then so caught me up,
U||That we were both one burden. As appears
U||The tower of Carisenda, from beneath
U||Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud
U||So sail across, that opposite it hangs,
U||Such then Antaeus seem’d, as at mine ease
U||I mark’d him stooping. I were fain at times
U||T’ have pass’d another way. Yet in th’ abyss,
U||That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,
U||lightly he plac’d us; nor there leaning stay’d,
U||But rose as in a bark the stately mast.
U||CANTO XXXII
U||Could I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit
U||That hole of sorrow, o’er which ev’ry rock
U||His firm abutment rears, then might the vein
U||Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine
U||Such measures, and with falt’ring awe I touch
U||The mighty theme; for to describe the depth
U||Of all the universe, is no emprize
U||To jest with, and demands a tongue not us’d
U||To infant babbling. But let them assist
U||My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid
U||Amphion wall’d in Thebes, so with the truth
U||My speech shall best accord. Oh ill-starr’d folk,
U||Beyond all others wretched! who abide
U||In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words
U||To speak of, better had ye here on earth
U||Been flocks or mountain goats. As down we stood
U||In the dark pit beneath the giants’ feet,
U||But lower far than they, and I did gaze
U||Still on the lofty battlement, a voice
U||Bespoke me thus: “Look how thou walkest. Take
U||Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads
U||Of thy poor brethren.” Thereupon I turn’d,
U||And saw before and underneath my feet
U||A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem’d
U||To glass than water. Not so thick a veil
U||In winter e’er hath Austrian Danube spread
U||O’er his still course, nor Tanais far remote
U||Under the chilling sky. Roll’d o’er that mass
U||Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall’n,
U||Not e’en its rim had creak’d. As peeps the frog
U||Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams
U||The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,
U||So, to where modest shame appears, thus low
U||Blue pinch’d and shrin’d in ice the spirits stood,
U||Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.
U||His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,
U||Their eyes express’d the dolour of their heart.
U||A space I look’d around, then at my feet
U||Saw two so strictly join’d, that of their head
U||The very hairs were mingled. “Tell me ye,
U||Whose bosoms thus together press,” said I,
U||“Who are ye?” At that sound their necks they bent,
U||And when their looks were lifted up to me,
U||Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,
U||Distill’d upon their lips, and the frost bound
U||The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.
U||Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos’d up
U||So stoutly. Whence like two enraged goats
U||They clash’d together; them such fury seiz’d.
U||And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,
U||Exclaim’d, still looking downward: “Why on us
U||Dost speculate so long? If thou wouldst know
U||Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave
U||Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own
U||Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves.
U||They from one body issued; and throughout
U||Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade
U||More worthy in congealment to be fix’d,
U||Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur’s land
U||At that one blow dissever’d, not Focaccia,
U||No not this spirit, whose o’erjutting head
U||Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name
U||Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,
U||Well knowest who he was: and to cut short
U||All further question, in my form behold
U||What once was Camiccione. I await
U||Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt
U||Shall wash out mine.” A thousand visages
U||Then mark’d I, which the keen and eager cold
U||Had shap’d into a doggish grin; whence creeps
U||A shiv’ring horror o’er me, at the thought
U||Of those frore shallows. While we journey’d on
U||Toward the middle, at whose point unites
U||All heavy substance, and I trembling went
U||Through that eternal chillness, I know not
U||If will it were or destiny, or chance,
U||But, passing ’midst the heads, my foot did strike
U||With violent blow against the face of one.
U||“Wherefore dost bruise me?” weeping, he exclaim’d,
U||“Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge
U||For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?”
U||I thus: “Instructor, now await me here,
U||That I through him may rid me of my doubt.
U||Thenceforth what haste thou wilt.” The teacher paus’d,
U||And to that shade I spake, who bitterly
U||Still curs’d me in his wrath. “What art thou, speak,
U||That railest thus on others?” He replied:
U||“Now who art thou, that smiting others’ cheeks
U||Through Antenora roamest, with such force
U||As were past suff’rance, wert thou living still?”
U||“And I am living, to thy joy perchance,”
U||Was my reply, “if fame be dear to thee,
U||That with the rest I may thy name enrol.”
U||“The contrary of what I covet most,”
U||Said he, “thou tender’st: hence; nor vex me more.
U||Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale.”
U||Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:
U||“Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here.”
U||“Rend all away,” he answer’d, “yet for that
U||I will not tell nor show thee who I am,
U||Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times.”
U||Now I had grasp’d his tresses, and stript off
U||More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes
U||Drawn in and downward, when another cried,
U||“What ails thee, Bocca? Sound not loud enough
U||Thy chatt’ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?
U||“What devil wrings thee?”—“Now,” said I, “be dumb,
U||Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee
U||True tidings will I bear.”—“Off,” he replied,
U||“Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence
U||To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,
U||Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman’s gold.
U||‘Him of Duera,’ thou canst say, ‘I mark’d,
U||Where the starv’d sinners pine.’ If thou be ask’d
U||What other shade was with them, at thy side
U||Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain’d
U||The biting axe of Florence. Farther on,
U||If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,
U||With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him
U||Who op’d Faenza when the people slept.”
U||We now had left him, passing on our way,
U||When I beheld two spirits by the ice
U||Pent in one hollow, that the head of one
U||Was cowl unto the other; and as bread
U||Is raven’d up through hunger, th’ uppermost
U||Did so apply his fangs to th’ other’s brain,
U||Where the spine joins it. Not more furiously
U||On Menalippus’ temples Tydeus gnaw’d,
U||Than on that skull and on its garbage he.
U||“O thou who show’st so beastly sign of hate
U||’Gainst him thou prey’st on, let me hear,” said I
U||“The cause, on such condition, that if right
U||Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,
U||And what the colour of his sinning was,
U||I may repay thee in the world above,
U||If that wherewith I speak be moist so long.”
U||CANTO XXXIII
U||His jaws uplifting from their fell repast,
U||That sinner wip’d them on the hairs o’ th’ head,
U||Which he behind had mangled, then began:
U||“Thy will obeying, I call up afresh
U||Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings
U||My heart, or ere I tell on’t. But if words,
U||That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear
U||Fruit of eternal infamy to him,
U||The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once
U||Shalt see me speak and weep. Who thou mayst be
U||I know not, nor how here below art come:
U||But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,
U||When I do hear thee. Know I was on earth
U||Count Ugolino, and th’ Archbishop he
U||Ruggieri. Why I neighbour him so close,
U||Now list. That through effect of his ill thoughts
U||In him my trust reposing, I was ta’en
U||And after murder’d, need is not I tell.
U||What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,
U||How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,
U||And know if he have wrong’d me. A small grate
U||Within that mew, which for my sake the name
U||Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,
U||Already through its opening sev’ral moons
U||Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,
U||That from the future tore the curtain off.
U||This one, methought, as master of the sport,
U||Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
U||Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight
U||Of Lucca to the Pisan. With lean brachs
U||Inquisitive and keen, before him rang’d
U||Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.
U||After short course the father and the sons
U||Seem’d tir’d and lagging, and methought I saw
U||The sharp tusks gore their sides. When I awoke
U||Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard
U||My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
U||For bread. Right cruel art thou, if no pang
U||Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
U||And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?
U||Now had they waken’d; and the hour drew near
U||When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
U||Of each misgave him through his dream, and I
U||Heard, at its outlet underneath lock’d up
U||The horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
U||I look’d upon the visage of my sons.
U||I wept not: so all stone I felt within.
U||They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:
U||‘Thou lookest so! Father what ails thee?’ Yet
U||I shed no tear, nor answer’d all that day
U||Nor the next night, until another sun
U||Came out upon the world. When a faint beam
U||Had to our doleful prison made its way,
U||And in four countenances I descry’d
U||The image of my own, on either hand
U||Through agony I bit, and they who thought
U||I did it through desire of feeding, rose
U||O’ th’ sudden, and cried, ‘Father, we should grieve
U||Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav’st
U||These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,
U||And do thou strip them off from us again.’
U||Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down
U||My spirit in stillness. That day and the next
U||We all were silent. Ah, obdurate earth!
U||Why open’dst not upon us? When we came
U||To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet
U||Outstretch’d did fling him, crying, ‘Hast no help
U||For me, my father!’ There he died, and e’en
U||Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three
U||Fall one by one ’twixt the fifth day and sixth:
U||Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope
U||Over them all, and for three days aloud
U||Call’d on them who were dead. Then fasting got
U||The mastery of grief.” Thus having spoke,
U||Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
U||He fasten’d, like a mastiff’s ’gainst the bone
U||Firm and unyielding. Oh thou Pisa! shame
U||Of all the people, who their dwelling make
U||In that fair region, where th’ Italian voice
U||Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack
U||To punish, from their deep foundations rise
U||Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up
U||The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee
U||May perish in the waters! What if fame
U||Reported that thy castles were betray’d
U||By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou
U||To stretch his children on the rack. For them,
U||Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair
U||Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,
U||Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make
U||Uncapable of guilt. Onward we pass’d,
U||Where others skarf’d in rugged folds of ice
U||Not on their feet were turn’d, but each revers’d.
U||There very weeping suffers not to weep;
U||For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
U||Impediment, and rolling inward turns
U||For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
U||Hang cluster’d, and like crystal vizors show,
U||Under the socket brimming all the cup.
U||Now though the cold had from my face dislodg’d
U||Each feeling, as ’t were callous, yet me seem’d
U||Some breath of wind I felt. “Whence cometh this,”
U||Said I, “my master? Is not here below
U||All vapour quench’d?”—“‘Thou shalt be speedily,”
U||He answer’d, “where thine eye shall tell thee whence
U||The cause descrying of this airy shower.”
U||Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn’d:
U||“O souls so cruel! that the farthest post
U||Hath been assign’d you, from this face remove
U||The harden’d veil, that I may vent the grief
U||Impregnate at my heart, some little space
U||Ere it congeal again!” I thus replied:
U||“Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;
U||And if I extricate thee not, far down
U||As to the lowest ice may I descend!”
U||“The friar Alberigo,” answered he,
U||“Am I, who from the evil garden pluck’d
U||Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date
U||More luscious for my fig.”—“Hah!” I exclaim’d,
U||“Art thou too dead!”—“How in the world aloft
U||It fareth with my body,” answer’d he,
U||“I am right ignorant. Such privilege
U||Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul
U||Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc’d.
U||And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
U||The glazed tear-drops that o’erlay mine eyes,
U||Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,
U||As I did, yields her body to a fiend
U||Who after moves and governs it at will,
U||Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
U||Falls to this cistern. And perchance above
U||Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,
U||Who here behind me winters. Him thou know’st,
U||If thou but newly art arriv’d below.
U||The years are many that have pass’d away,
U||Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.”
U||“Now,” answer’d I, “methinks thou mockest me,
U||For Branca Doria never yet hath died,
U||But doth all natural functions of a man,
U||Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on.”
U||He thus: “Not yet unto that upper foss
U||By th’ evil talons guarded, where the pitch
U||Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach’d,
U||When this one left a demon in his stead
U||In his own body, and of one his kin,
U||Who with him treachery wrought. But now put forth
U||Thy hand, and ope mine eyes.” I op’d them not.
U||Ill manners were best courtesy to him.
U||Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,
U||With every foulness stain’d, why from the earth
U||Are ye not cancel’d? Such an one of yours
U||I with Romagna’s darkest spirit found,
U||As for his doings even now in soul
U||Is in Cocytus plung’d, and yet doth seem
U||In body still alive upon the earth.
U||CANTO XXXIV
U||“The banners of Hell’s Monarch do come forth
U||Towards us; therefore look,” so spake my guide,
U||“If thou discern him.” As, when breathes a cloud
U||Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night
U||Fall on our hemisphere, seems view’d from far
U||A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,
U||Such was the fabric then methought I saw,
U||To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew
U||Behind my guide: no covert else was there.
U||Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
U||Record the marvel) where the souls were all
U||Whelm’d underneath, transparent, as through glass
U||Pellucid the frail stem. Some prone were laid,
U||Others stood upright, this upon the soles,
U||That on his head, a third with face to feet
U||Arch’d like a bow. When to the point we came,
U||Whereat my guide was pleas’d that I should see
U||The creature eminent in beauty once,
U||He from before me stepp’d and made me pause.
U||“Lo!” he exclaim’d, “lo Dis! and lo the place,
U||Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength.”
U||How frozen and how faint I then became,
U||Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,
U||Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.
U||I was not dead nor living. Think thyself
U||If quick conception work in thee at all,
U||How I did feel. That emperor, who sways
U||The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th’ ice
U||Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
U||A giant, than the giants are in his arms.
U||Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits
U||With such a part. If he were beautiful
U||As he is hideous now, and yet did dare
U||To scowl upon his Maker, well from him
U||May all our mis’ry flow. Oh what a sight!
U||How passing strange it seem’d, when I did spy
U||Upon his head three faces: one in front
U||Of hue vermilion, th’ other two with this
U||Midway each shoulder join’d and at the crest;
U||The right ’twixt wan and yellow seem’d: the left
U||To look on, such as come from whence old Nile
U||Stoops to the lowlands. Under each shot forth
U||Two mighty wings, enormous as became
U||A bird so vast. Sails never such I saw
U||Outstretch’d on the wide sea. No plumes had they,
U||But were in texture like a bat, and these
U||He flapp’d i’ th’ air, that from him issued still
U||Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth
U||Was frozen. At six eyes he wept: the tears
U||Adown three chins distill’d with bloody foam.
U||At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ’d
U||Bruis’d as with pond’rous engine, so that three
U||Were in this guise tormented. But far more
U||Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang’d
U||By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back
U||Was stript of all its skin. “That upper spirit,
U||Who hath worse punishment,” so spake my guide,
U||“Is Judas, he that hath his head within
U||And plies the feet without. Of th’ other two,
U||Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw
U||Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe
U||And speaks not! Th’ other Cassius, that appears
U||So large of limb. But night now re-ascends,
U||And it is time for parting. All is seen.”
U||I clipp’d him round the neck, for so he bade;
U||And noting time and place, he, when the wings
U||Enough were op’d, caught fast the shaggy sides,
U||And down from pile to pile descending stepp’d
U||Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.
U||Soon as he reach’d the point, whereat the thigh
U||Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,
U||My leader there with pain and struggling hard
U||Turn’d round his head, where his feet stood before,
U||And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,
U||That into hell methought we turn’d again.
U||“Expect that by such stairs as these,” thus spake
U||The teacher, panting like a man forespent,
U||“We must depart from evil so extreme.”
U||Then at a rocky opening issued forth,
U||And plac’d me on a brink to sit, next join’d
U||With wary step my side. I rais’d mine eyes,
U||Believing that I Lucifer should see
U||Where he was lately left, but saw him now
U||With legs held upward. Let the grosser sort,
U||Who see not what the point was I had pass’d,
U||Bethink them if sore toil oppress’d me then.
U||“Arise,” my master cried, “upon thy feet.
U||The way is long, and much uncouth the road;
U||And now within one hour and half of noon
U||The sun returns.” It was no palace-hall
U||Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,
U||But natural dungeon where ill footing was
U||And scant supply of light. “Ere from th’ abyss
U||I sep’rate,” thus when risen I began,
U||“My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free
U||From error’s thralldom. Where is now the ice?
U||How standeth he in posture thus revers’d?
U||And how from eve to morn in space so brief
U||Hath the sun made his transit?” He in few
U||Thus answering spake: “Thou deemest thou art still
U||On th’ other side the centre, where I grasp’d
U||Th’ abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.
U||Thou wast on th’ other side, so long as I
U||Descended; when I turn’d, thou didst o’erpass
U||That point, to which from ev’ry part is dragg’d
U||All heavy substance. Thou art now arriv’d
U||Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
U||Which the great continent doth overspread,
U||And underneath whose canopy expir’d
U||The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv’d.
U||Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
U||Whose other aspect is Judecca. Morn
U||Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
U||Whose shaggy pile was scal’d, yet standeth fix’d,
U||As at the first. On this part he fell down
U||From heav’n; and th’ earth, here prominent before,
U||Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
U||And to our hemisphere retir’d. Perchance
U||To shun him was the vacant space left here
U||By what of firm land on this side appears,
U||That sprang aloof.” There is a place beneath,
U||From Belzebub as distant, as extends
U||The vaulted tomb, discover’d not by sight,
U||But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
U||This way along the hollow of a rock,
U||Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
U||The wave hath eaten. By that hidden way
U||My guide and I did enter, to return
U||To the fair world: and heedless of repose
U||We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
U||Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav’n
U||Dawn’d through a circular opening in the cave:
U||Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.
U||PURGATORY
U||CANTO I
U||O’er better waves to speed her rapid course
U||The light bark of my genius lifts the sail,
U||Well pleas’d to leave so cruel sea behind;
U||And of that second region will I sing,
U||In which the human spirit from sinful blot
U||Is purg’d, and for ascent to Heaven prepares.
U||Here, O ye hallow’d Nine! for in your train
U||I follow, here the deadened strain revive;
U||Nor let Calliope refuse to sound
U||A somewhat higher song, of that loud tone,
U||Which when the wretched birds of chattering note
U||Had heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope.
U||Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread
U||O’er the serene aspect of the pure air,
U||High up as the first circle, to mine eyes
U||Unwonted joy renew’d, soon as I ’scap’d
U||Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,
U||That had mine eyes and bosom fill’d with grief.
U||The radiant planet, that to love invites,
U||Made all the orient laugh, and veil’d beneath
U||The Pisces’ light, that in his escort came.
U||To the right hand I turn’d, and fix’d my mind
U||On the’ other pole attentive, where I saw
U||Four stars ne’er seen before save by the ken
U||Of our first parents. Heaven of their rays
U||Seem’d joyous. O thou northern site, bereft
U||Indeed, and widow’d, since of these depriv’d!
U||As from this view I had desisted, straight
U||Turning a little tow’rds the other pole,
U||There from whence now the wain had disappear’d,
U||I saw an old man standing by my side
U||Alone, so worthy of rev’rence in his look,
U||That ne’er from son to father more was ow’d.
U||Low down his beard and mix’d with hoary white
U||Descended, like his locks, which parting fell
U||Upon his breast in double fold. The beams
U||Of those four luminaries on his face
U||So brightly shone, and with such radiance clear
U||Deck’d it, that I beheld him as the sun.
U||“Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,
U||Forth from th’ eternal prison-house have fled?”
U||He spoke and moved those venerable plumes.
U||“Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure
U||Lights you emerging from the depth of night,
U||That makes the infernal valley ever black?
U||Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss
U||Broken, or in high heaven new laws ordain’d,
U||That thus, condemn’d, ye to my caves approach?”
U||My guide, then laying hold on me, by words
U||And intimations given with hand and head,
U||Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay
U||Due reverence; then thus to him replied.
U||“Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven
U||Descending, had besought me in my charge
U||To bring. But since thy will implies, that more
U||Our true condition I unfold at large,
U||Mine is not to deny thee thy request.
U||This mortal ne’er hath seen the farthest gloom.
U||But erring by his folly had approach’d
U||So near, that little space was left to turn.
U||Then, as before I told, I was dispatch’d
U||To work his rescue, and no way remain’d
U||Save this which I have ta’en. I have display’d
U||Before him all the regions of the bad;
U||And purpose now those spirits to display,
U||That under thy command are purg’d from sin.
U||How I have brought him would be long to say.
U||From high descends the virtue, by whose aid
U||I to thy sight and hearing him have led.
U||Now may our coming please thee. In the search
U||Of liberty he journeys: that how dear
U||They know, who for her sake have life refus’d.
U||Thou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet
U||In Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,
U||That in the last great day will shine so bright.
U||For us the’ eternal edicts are unmov’d:
U||He breathes, and I am free of Minos’ power,
U||Abiding in that circle where the eyes
U||Of thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look
U||Prays thee, O hallow’d spirit! to own her shine.
U||Then by her love we’ implore thee, let us pass
U||Through thy sev’n regions; for which best thanks
U||I for thy favour will to her return,
U||If mention there below thou not disdain.”
U||“Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,”
U||He then to him rejoin’d, “while I was there,
U||That all she ask’d me I was fain to grant.
U||Now that beyond the’ accursed stream she dwells,
U||She may no longer move me, by that law,
U||Which was ordain’d me, when I issued thence.
U||Not so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,
U||Moves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.
U||Enough for me that in her name thou ask.
U||Go therefore now: and with a slender reed
U||See that thou duly gird him, and his face
U||Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.
U||For not with eye, by any cloud obscur’d,
U||Would it be seemly before him to come,
U||Who stands the foremost minister in heaven.
U||This islet all around, there far beneath,
U||Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed
U||Produces store of reeds. No other plant,
U||Cover’d with leaves, or harden’d in its stalk,
U||There lives, not bending to the water’s sway.
U||After, this way return not; but the sun
U||Will show you, that now rises, where to take
U||The mountain in its easiest ascent.”
U||He disappear’d; and I myself uprais’d
U||Speechless, and to my guide retiring close,
U||Toward him turn’d mine eyes. He thus began;
U||“My son! observant thou my steps pursue.
U||We must retreat to rearward, for that way
U||The champain to its low extreme declines.”
U||The dawn had chas’d the matin hour of prime,
U||Which deaf before it, so that from afar
U||I spy’d the trembling of the ocean stream.
U||We travers’d the deserted plain, as one
U||Who, wander’d from his track, thinks every step
U||Trodden in vain till he regain the path.
U||When we had come, where yet the tender dew
U||Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh
U||The wind breath’d o’er it, while it slowly dried;
U||Both hands extended on the watery grass
U||My master plac’d, in graceful act and kind.
U||Whence I of his intent before appriz’d,
U||Stretch’d out to him my cheeks suffus’d with tears.
U||There to my visage he anew restor’d
U||That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal’d.
U||Then on the solitary shore arriv’d,
U||That never sailing on its waters saw
U||Man, that could after measure back his course,
U||He girt me in such manner as had pleas’d
U||Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!
U||As he selected every humble plant,
U||Wherever one was pluck’d, another there
U||Resembling, straightway in its place arose.
U||CANTO II
U||Now had the sun to that horizon reach’d,
U||That covers, with the most exalted point
U||Of its meridian circle, Salem’s walls,
U||And night, that opposite to him her orb
U||Sounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,
U||Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp’d
U||When she reigns highest: so that where I was,
U||Aurora’s white and vermeil-tinctur’d cheek
U||To orange turn’d as she in age increas’d.
U||Meanwhile we linger’d by the water’s brink,
U||Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought
U||Journey, while motionless the body rests.
U||When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,
U||Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam
U||Glares down in west, over the ocean floor;
U||So seem’d, what once again I hope to view,
U||A light so swiftly coming through the sea,
U||No winged course might equal its career.
U||From which when for a space I had withdrawn
U||Thine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,
U||Again I look’d and saw it grown in size
U||And brightness: thou on either side appear’d
U||Something, but what I knew not of bright hue,
U||And by degrees from underneath it came
U||Another. My preceptor silent yet
U||Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern’d,
U||Open’d the form of wings: then when he knew
U||The pilot, cried aloud, “Down, down; bend low
U||Thy knees; behold God’s angel: fold thy hands:
U||Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.”
U||Lo how all human means he sets at naught!
U||So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail
U||Except his wings, between such distant shores.
U||Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear’d,
U||Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,
U||That not like mortal hairs fall off or change!”
U||As more and more toward us came, more bright
U||Appear’d the bird of God, nor could the eye
U||Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.
U||He drove ashore in a small bark so swift
U||And light, that in its course no wave it drank.
U||The heav’nly steersman at the prow was seen,
U||Visibly written blessed in his looks.
U||Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.
U||“In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;”
U||All with one voice together sang, with what
U||In the remainder of that hymn is writ.
U||Then soon as with the sign of holy cross
U||He bless’d them, they at once leap’d out on land,
U||The swiftly as he came return’d. The crew,
U||There left, appear’d astounded with the place,
U||Gazing around as one who sees new sights.
U||From every side the sun darted his beams,
U||And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav’n
U||Had chas’d the Capricorn, when that strange tribe
U||Lifting their eyes towards us: “If ye know,
U||Declare what path will Lead us to the mount.”
U||Them Virgil answer’d. “Ye suppose perchance
U||Us well acquainted with this place: but here,
U||We, as yourselves, are strangers. Not long erst
U||We came, before you but a little space,
U||By other road so rough and hard, that now
U||The’ ascent will seem to us as play.” The spirits,
U||Who from my breathing had perceiv’d I liv’d,
U||Grew pale with wonder. As the multitude
U||Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,
U||To hear what news he brings, and in their haste
U||Tread one another down, e’en so at sight
U||Of me those happy spirits were fix’d, each one
U||Forgetful of its errand, to depart,
U||Where cleans’d from sin, it might be made all fair.
U||Then one I saw darting before the rest
U||With such fond ardour to embrace me, I
U||To do the like was mov’d. O shadows vain
U||Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands
U||I clasp’d behind it, they as oft return’d
U||Empty into my breast again. Surprise
U||I needs must think was painted in my looks,
U||For that the shadow smil’d and backward drew.
U||To follow it I hasten’d, but with voice
U||Of sweetness it enjoin’d me to desist.
U||Then who it was I knew, and pray’d of it,
U||To talk with me, it would a little pause.
U||It answered: “Thee as in my mortal frame
U||I lov’d, so loos’d forth it I love thee still,
U||And therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?”
U||“Not without purpose once more to return,
U||Thou find’st me, my Casella, where I am
U||Journeying this way;” I said, “but how of thee
U||Hath so much time been lost?” He answer’d straight:
U||“No outrage hath been done to me, if he
U||Who when and whom he chooses takes, me oft
U||This passage hath denied, since of just will
U||His will he makes. These three months past indeed,
U||He, whose chose to enter, with free leave
U||Hath taken; whence I wand’ring by the shore
U||Where Tyber’s wave grows salt, of him gain’d kind
U||Admittance, at that river’s mouth, tow’rd which
U||His wings are pointed, for there always throng
U||All such as not to Archeron descend.”
U||Then I: “If new laws have not quite destroy’d
U||Memory and use of that sweet song of love,
U||That while all my cares had power to ’swage;
U||Please thee with it a little to console
U||My spirit, that incumber’d with its frame,
U||Travelling so far, of pain is overcome.”
U||“Love that discourses in my thoughts.” He then
U||Began in such soft accents, that within
U||The sweetness thrills me yet. My gentle guide
U||And all who came with him, so well were pleas’d,
U||That seem’d naught else might in their thoughts have room.
U||Fast fix’d in mute attention to his notes
U||We stood, when lo! that old man venerable
U||Exclaiming, “How is this, ye tardy spirits?
U||What negligence detains you loit’ring here?
U||Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,
U||That from your eyes the sight of God conceal.”
U||As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food
U||Collected, blade or tares, without their pride
U||Accustom’d, and in still and quiet sort,
U||If aught alarm them, suddenly desert
U||Their meal, assail’d by more important care;
U||So I that new-come troop beheld, the song
U||Deserting, hasten to the mountain’s side,
U||As one who goes yet where he tends knows not.
U||Nor with less hurried step did we depart.
U||CANTO III
U||Them sudden flight had scatter’d over the plain,
U||Turn’d tow’rds the mountain, whither reason’s voice
U||Drives us; I to my faithful company
U||Adhering, left it not. For how of him
U||Depriv’d, might I have sped, or who beside
U||Would o’er the mountainous tract have led my steps
U||He with the bitter pang of self-remorse
U||Seem’d smitten. O clear conscience and upright
U||How doth a little fling wound thee sore!
U||Soon as his feet desisted (slack’ning pace),
U||From haste, that mars all decency of act,
U||My mind, that in itself before was wrapt,
U||Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor’d:
U||And full against the steep ascent I set
U||My face, where highest to heav’n its top o’erflows.
U||The sun, that flar’d behind, with ruddy beam
U||Before my form was broken; for in me
U||His rays resistance met. I turn’d aside
U||With fear of being left, when I beheld
U||Only before myself the ground obscur’d.
U||When thus my solace, turning him around,
U||Bespake me kindly: “Why distrustest thou?
U||Believ’st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?
U||It now is evening there, where buried lies
U||The body, in which I cast a shade, remov’d
U||To Naples from Brundusium’s wall. Nor thou
U||Marvel, if before me no shadow fall,
U||More than that in the sky element
U||One ray obstructs not other. To endure
U||Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames
U||That virtue hath dispos’d, which how it works
U||Wills not to us should be reveal’d. Insane
U||Who hopes, our reason may that space explore,
U||Which holds three persons in one substance knit.
U||Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;
U||Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been
U||For Mary to bring forth. Moreover ye
U||Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly;
U||To whose desires repose would have been giv’n,
U||That now but serve them for eternal grief.
U||I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,
U||And others many more.” And then he bent
U||Downwards his forehead, and in troubled mood
U||Broke off his speech. Meanwhile we had arriv’d
U||Far as the mountain’s foot, and there the rock
U||Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps
U||To climb it had been vain. The most remote
U||Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract
U||’Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this
U||A ladder easy’ and open of access.
U||“Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?”
U||My master said and paus’d, “so that he may
U||Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?”
U||And while with looks directed to the ground
U||The meaning of the pathway he explor’d,
U||And I gaz’d upward round the stony height,
U||Of spirits, that toward us mov’d their steps,
U||Yet moving seem’d not, they so slow approach’d.
U||I thus my guide address’d: “Upraise thine eyes,
U||Lo that way some, of whom thou may’st obtain
U||Counsel, if of thyself thou find’st it not!”
U||Straightway he look’d, and with free speech replied:
U||“Let us tend thither: they but softly come.
U||And thou be firm in hope, my son belov’d.”
U||Now was that people distant far in space
U||A thousand paces behind ours, as much
U||As at a throw the nervous arm could fling,
U||When all drew backward on the messy crags
U||Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov’d
U||As one who walks in doubt might stand to look.
U||“O spirits perfect! O already chosen!”
U||Virgil to them began, “by that blest peace,
U||Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar’d,
U||Instruct us where the mountain low declines,
U||So that attempt to mount it be not vain.
U||For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.”
U||As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,
U||Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest
U||Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose
U||To ground, and what the foremost does, that do
U||The others, gath’ring round her, if she stops,
U||Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;
U||So saw I moving to advance the first,
U||Who of that fortunate crew were at the head,
U||Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.
U||When they before me had beheld the light
U||From my right side fall broken on the ground,
U||So that the shadow reach’d the cave, they stopp’d
U||And somewhat back retir’d: the same did all,
U||Who follow’d, though unweeting of the cause.
U||“Unask’d of you, yet freely I confess,
U||This is a human body which ye see.
U||That the sun’s light is broken on the ground,
U||Marvel not: but believe, that not without
U||Virtue deriv’d from Heaven, we to climb
U||Over this wall aspire.” So them bespake
U||My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin’d;
U||“Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,”
U||Making a signal to us with bent hands.
U||Then of them one began. “Whoe’er thou art,
U||Who journey’st thus this way, thy visage turn,
U||Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen.”
U||I tow’rds him turn’d, and with fix’d eye beheld.
U||Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,
U||He seem’d, but on one brow a gash was mark’d.
U||When humbly I disclaim’d to have beheld
U||Him ever: “Now behold!” he said, and show’d
U||High on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.
U||“I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen
U||Costanza: whence I pray thee, when return’d,
U||To my fair daughter go, the parent glad
U||Of Aragonia and Sicilia’s pride;
U||And of the truth inform her, if of me
U||Aught else be told. When by two mortal blows
U||My frame was shatter’d, I betook myself
U||Weeping to him, who of free will forgives.
U||My sins were horrible; but so wide arms
U||Hath goodness infinite, that it receives
U||All who turn to it. Had this text divine
U||Been of Cosenza’s shepherd better scann’d,
U||Who then by Clement on my hunt was set,
U||Yet at the bridge’s head my bones had lain,
U||Near Benevento, by the heavy mole
U||Protected; but the rain now drenches them,
U||And the wind drives, out of the kingdom’s bounds,
U||Far as the stream of Verde, where, with lights
U||Extinguish’d, he remov’d them from their bed.
U||Yet by their curse we are not so destroy’d,
U||But that the eternal love may turn, while hope
U||Retains her verdant blossoms. True it is,
U||That such one as in contumacy dies
U||Against the holy church, though he repent,
U||Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
U||In his presumption past; if such decree
U||Be not by prayers of good men shorter made
U||Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;
U||Revealing to my good Costanza, how
U||Thou hast beheld me, and beside the terms
U||Laid on me of that interdict; for here
U||By means of those below much profit comes.”
U||CANTO IV
U||When by sensations of delight or pain,
U||That any of our faculties hath seiz’d,
U||Entire the soul collects herself, it seems
U||She is intent upon that power alone,
U||And thus the error is disprov’d which holds
U||The soul not singly lighted in the breast.
U||And therefore when as aught is heard or seen,
U||That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn’d,
U||Time passes, and a man perceives it not.
U||For that, whereby he hearken, is one power,
U||Another that, which the whole spirit hash;
U||This is as it were bound, while that is free.
U||This found I true by proof, hearing that spirit
U||And wond’ring; for full fifty steps aloft
U||The sun had measur’d unobserv’d of me,
U||When we arriv’d where all with one accord
U||The spirits shouted, “Here is what ye ask.”
U||A larger aperture ofttimes is stopp’d
U||With forked stake of thorn by villager,
U||When the ripe grape imbrowns, than was the path,
U||By which my guide, and I behind him close,
U||Ascended solitary, when that troop
U||Departing left us. On Sanleo’s road
U||Who journeys, or to Noli low descends,
U||Or mounts Bismantua’s height, must use his feet;
U||But here a man had need to fly, I mean
U||With the swift wing and plumes of high desire,
U||Conducted by his aid, who gave me hope,
U||And with light furnish’d to direct my way.
U||We through the broken rock ascended, close
U||Pent on each side, while underneath the ground
U||Ask’d help of hands and feet. When we arriv’d
U||Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank,
U||Where the plain level open’d I exclaim’d,
U||“O master! say which way can we proceed?”
U||He answer’d, “Let no step of thine recede.
U||Behind me gain the mountain, till to us
U||Some practis’d guide appear.” That eminence
U||Was lofty that no eye might reach its point,
U||And the side proudly rising, more than line
U||From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.
U||I wearied thus began: “Parent belov’d!
U||Turn, and behold how I remain alone,
U||If thou stay not.”—“My son!” He straight reply’d,
U||“Thus far put forth thy strength;” and to a track
U||Pointed, that, on this side projecting, round
U||Circles the hill. His words so spurr’d me on,
U||That I behind him clamb’ring, forc’d myself,
U||Till my feet press’d the circuit plain beneath.
U||There both together seated, turn’d we round
U||To eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft
U||Many beside have with delight look’d back.
U||First on the nether shores I turn’d my eyes,
U||Then rais’d them to the sun, and wond’ring mark’d
U||That from the left it smote us. Soon perceiv’d
U||That Poet sage now at the car of light
U||Amaz’d I stood, where ’twixt us and the north
U||Its course it enter’d. Whence he thus to me:
U||“Were Leda’s offspring now in company
U||Of that broad mirror, that high up and low
U||Imparts his light beneath, thou might’st behold
U||The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears
U||Wheel, if its ancient course it not forsook.
U||How that may be if thou would’st think; within
U||Pond’ring, imagine Sion with this mount
U||Plac’d on the earth, so that to both be one
U||Horizon, and two hemispheres apart,
U||Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew
U||To guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see
U||How of necessity by this on one
U||He passes, while by that on the’ other side,
U||If with clear view shine intellect attend.”
U||“Of truth, kind teacher!” I exclaim’d, “so clear
U||Aught saw I never, as I now discern
U||Where seem’d my ken to fail, that the mid orb
U||Of the supernal motion (which in terms
U||Of art is called the Equator, and remains
U||Ever between the sun and winter) for the cause
U||Thou hast assign’d, from hence toward the north
U||Departs, when those who in the Hebrew land
U||Inhabit, see it tow’rds the warmer part.
U||But if it please thee, I would gladly know,
U||How far we have to journey: for the hill
U||Mounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount.”
U||He thus to me: “Such is this steep ascent,
U||That it is ever difficult at first,
U||But, more a man proceeds, less evil grows.
U||When pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much
U||That upward going shall be easy to thee.
U||As in a vessel to go down the tide,
U||Then of this path thou wilt have reach’d the end.
U||There hope to rest thee from thy toil. No more
U||I answer, and thus far for certain know.”
U||As he his words had spoken, near to us
U||A voice there sounded: “Yet ye first perchance
U||May to repose you by constraint be led.”
U||At sound thereof each turn’d, and on the left
U||A huge stone we beheld, of which nor I
U||Nor he before was ware. Thither we drew,
U||find there were some, who in the shady place
U||Behind the rock were standing, as a man
U||Thru’ idleness might stand. Among them one,
U||Who seem’d to me much wearied, sat him down,
U||And with his arms did fold his knees about,
U||Holding his face between them downward bent.
U||“Sweet Sir!” I cry’d, “behold that man, who shows
U||Himself more idle, than if laziness
U||Were sister to him.” Straight he turn’d to us,
U||And, o’er the thigh lifting his face, observ’d,
U||Then in these accents spake: “Up then, proceed
U||Thou valiant one.” Straight who it was I knew;
U||Nor could the pain I felt (for want of breath
U||Still somewhat urg’d me) hinder my approach.
U||And when I came to him, he scarce his head
U||Uplifted, saying “Well hast thou discern’d,
U||How from the left the sun his chariot leads.”
U||His lazy acts and broken words my lips
U||To laughter somewhat mov’d; when I began:
U||“Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more.
U||But tell, why thou art seated upright there?
U||Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?
U||Or blame I only shine accustom’d ways?”
U||Then he: “My brother, of what use to mount,
U||When to my suffering would not let me pass
U||The bird of God, who at the portal sits?
U||Behooves so long that heav’n first bear me round
U||Without its limits, as in life it bore,
U||Because I to the end repentant Sighs
U||Delay’d, if prayer do not aid me first,
U||That riseth up from heart which lives in grace.
U||What other kind avails, not heard in heaven?”
U||Before me now the Poet up the mount
U||Ascending, cried: “Haste thee, for see the sun
U||Has touch’d the point meridian, and the night
U||Now covers with her foot Marocco’s shore.”
U||CANTO V
U||Now had I left those spirits, and pursued
U||The steps of my Conductor, when beheld
U||Pointing the finger at me one exclaim’d:
U||“See how it seems as if the light not shone
U||From the left hand of him beneath, and he,
U||As living, seems to be led on.” Mine eyes
U||I at that sound reverting, saw them gaze
U||Through wonder first at me, and then at me
U||And the light broken underneath, by turns.
U||“Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?” my guide
U||Exclaim’d, “that thou hast slack’d thy pace? or how
U||Imports it thee, what thing is whisper’d here?
U||Come after me, and to their babblings leave
U||The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,
U||Shakes not its top for any blast that blows!
U||He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,
U||Still of his aim is wide, in that the one
U||Sicklies and wastes to nought the other’s strength.”
U||What other could I answer save “I come?”
U||I said it, somewhat with that colour ting’d
U||Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.
U||Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came,
U||A little way before us, some who sang
U||The “Miserere” in responsive Strains.
U||When they perceiv’d that through my body I
U||Gave way not for the rays to pass, their song
U||Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang’d;
U||And two of them, in guise of messengers,
U||Ran on to meet us, and inquiring ask’d:
U||“Of your condition we would gladly learn.”
U||To them my guide. “Ye may return, and bear
U||Tidings to them who sent you, that his frame
U||Is real flesh. If, as I deem, to view
U||His shade they paus’d, enough is answer’d them.
U||Him let them honour, they may prize him well.”
U||Ne’er saw I fiery vapours with such speed
U||Cut through the serene air at fall of night,
U||Nor August’s clouds athwart the setting sun,
U||That upward these did not in shorter space
U||Return; and, there arriving, with the rest
U||Wheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop.
U||“Many,” exclaim’d the bard, “are these, who throng
U||Around us: to petition thee they come.
U||Go therefore on, and listen as thou go’st.”
U||“O spirit! who go’st on to blessedness
U||With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth.”
U||Shouting they came, “a little rest thy step.
U||Look if thou any one amongst our tribe
U||Hast e’er beheld, that tidings of him there
U||Thou mayst report. Ah, wherefore go’st thou on?
U||Ah wherefore tarriest thou not? We all
U||By violence died, and to our latest hour
U||Were sinners, but then warn’d by light from heav’n,
U||So that, repenting and forgiving, we
U||Did issue out of life at peace with God,
U||Who with desire to see him fills our heart.”
U||Then I: “The visages of all I scan
U||Yet none of ye remember. But if aught,
U||That I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!
U||Speak; and I will perform it, by that peace,
U||Which on the steps of guide so excellent
U||Following from world to world intent I seek.”
U||In answer he began: “None here distrusts
U||Thy kindness, though not promis’d with an oath;
U||So as the will fail not for want of power.
U||Whence I, who sole before the others speak,
U||Entreat thee, if thou ever see that land,
U||Which lies between Romagna and the realm
U||Of Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray
U||Those who inhabit Fano, that for me
U||Their adorations duly be put up,
U||By which I may purge off my grievous sins.
U||From thence I came. But the deep passages,
U||Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,
U||Upon my bosom in Antenor’s land
U||Were made, where to be more secure I thought.
U||The author of the deed was Este’s prince,
U||Who, more than right could warrant, with his wrath
U||Pursued me. Had I towards Mira fled,
U||When overta’en at Oriaco, still
U||Might I have breath’d. But to the marsh I sped,
U||And in the mire and rushes tangled there
U||Fell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain.”
U||Then said another: “Ah! so may the wish,
U||That takes thee o’er the mountain, be fulfill’d,
U||As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.
U||Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:
U||Giovanna nor none else have care for me,
U||Sorrowing with these I therefore go.” I thus:
U||“From Campaldino’s field what force or chance
U||Drew thee, that ne’er thy sepulture was known?”
U||“Oh!” answer’d he, “at Casentino’s foot
U||A stream there courseth, nam’d Archiano, sprung
U||In Apennine above the Hermit’s seat.
U||E’en where its name is cancel’d, there came I,
U||Pierc’d in the heart, fleeing away on foot,
U||And bloodying the plain. Here sight and speech
U||Fail’d me, and finishing with Mary’s name
U||I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain’d.
U||I will report the truth; which thou again
U||Tell to the living. Me God’s angel took,
U||Whilst he of hell exclaim’d: “O thou from heav’n!
U||Say wherefore hast thou robb’d me? Thou of him
U||Th’ eternal portion bear’st with thee away
U||For one poor tear that he deprives me of.
U||But of the other, other rule I make.”
U||“Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects
U||That vapour dank, returning into water,
U||Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.
U||That evil will, which in his intellect
U||Still follows evil, came, and rais’d the wind
U||And smoky mist, by virtue of the power
U||Given by his nature. Thence the valley, soon
U||As day was spent, he cover’d o’er with cloud
U||From Pratomagno to the mountain range,
U||And stretch’d the sky above, so that the air
U||Impregnate chang’d to water. Fell the rain,
U||And to the fosses came all that the land
U||Contain’d not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,
U||To the great river with such headlong sweep
U||Rush’d, that nought stay’d its course. My stiffen’d frame
U||Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,
U||And dash’d it into Arno, from my breast
U||Loos’ning the cross, that of myself I made
U||When overcome with pain. He hurl’d me on,
U||Along the banks and bottom of his course;
U||Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt.”
U||“Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return’d,
U||And rested after thy long road,” so spake
U||Next the third spirit; “then remember me.
U||I once was Pia. Sienna gave me life,
U||Maremma took it from me. That he knows,
U||Who me with jewell’d ring had first espous’d.”
U||CANTO VI
U||When from their game of dice men separate,
U||He, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix’d,
U||Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws
U||He cast: but meanwhile all the company
U||Go with the other; one before him runs,
U||And one behind his mantle twitches, one
U||Fast by his side bids him remember him.
U||He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand
U||Is stretch’d, well knows he bids him stand aside;
U||And thus he from the press defends himself.
U||E’en such was I in that close-crowding throng;
U||And turning so my face around to all,
U||And promising, I ’scap’d from it with pains.
U||Here of Arezzo him I saw, who fell
U||By Ghino’s cruel arm; and him beside,
U||Who in his chase was swallow’d by the stream.
U||Here Frederic Novello, with his hand
U||Stretch’d forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,
U||Who put the good Marzuco to such proof
U||Of constancy. Count Orso I beheld;
U||And from its frame a soul dismiss’d for spite
U||And envy, as it said, but for no crime:
U||I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,
U||While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant
U||Let her beware; lest for so false a deed
U||She herd with worse than these. When I was freed
U||From all those spirits, who pray’d for others’ prayers
U||To hasten on their state of blessedness;
U||Straight I began: “O thou, my luminary!
U||It seems expressly in thy text denied,
U||That heaven’s supreme decree can never bend
U||To supplication; yet with this design
U||Do these entreat. Can then their hope be vain,
U||Or is thy saying not to me reveal’d?”
U||He thus to me: “Both what I write is plain,
U||And these deceiv’d not in their hope, if well
U||Thy mind consider, that the sacred height
U||Of judgment doth not stoop, because love’s flame
U||In a short moment all fulfils, which he
U||Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy.
U||Besides, when I this point concluded thus,
U||By praying no defect could be supplied;
U||Because the pray’r had none access to God.
U||Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not
U||Contented unless she assure thee so,
U||Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.
U||I know not if thou take me right; I mean
U||Beatrice. Her thou shalt behold above,
U||Upon this mountain’s crown, fair seat of joy.”
U||Then I: “Sir! let us mend our speed; for now
U||I tire not as before; and lo! the hill
U||Stretches its shadow far.” He answer’d thus:
U||“Our progress with this day shall be as much
U||As we may now dispatch; but otherwise
U||Than thou supposest is the truth. For there
U||Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold
U||Him back returning, who behind the steep
U||Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam
U||Thou dost not break. But lo! a spirit there
U||Stands solitary, and toward us looks:
U||It will instruct us in the speediest way.”
U||We soon approach’d it. O thou Lombard spirit!
U||How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,
U||Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!
U||It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,
U||Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.
U||But Virgil with entreaty mild advanc’d,
U||Requesting it to show the best ascent.
U||It answer to his question none return’d,
U||But of our country and our kind of life
U||Demanded. When my courteous guide began,
U||“Mantua,” the solitary shadow quick
U||Rose towards us from the place in which it stood,
U||And cry’d, “Mantuan! I am thy countryman
U||Sordello.” Each the other then embrac’d.
U||Ah slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,
U||Vessel without a pilot in loud storm,
U||Lady no longer of fair provinces,
U||But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,
U||Ev’n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land
U||Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen
U||With such glad cheer; while now thy living ones
U||In thee abide not without war; and one
U||Malicious gnaws another, ay of those
U||Whom the same wall and the same moat contains,
U||Seek, wretched one! around thy sea-coasts wide;
U||Then homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark
U||If any part of the sweet peace enjoy.
U||What boots it, that thy reins Justinian’s hand
U||Befitted, if thy saddle be unpress’d?
U||Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.
U||Ah people! thou obedient still shouldst live,
U||And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,
U||If well thou marked’st that which God commands.
U||Look how that beast to felness hath relaps’d
U||From having lost correction of the spur,
U||Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand,
U||O German Albert! who abandon’st her,
U||That is grown savage and unmanageable,
U||When thou should’st clasp her flanks with forked heels.
U||Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood!
U||And be it strange and manifest to all!
U||Such as may strike thy successor with dread!
U||For that thy sire and thou have suffer’d thus,
U||Through greediness of yonder realms detain’d,
U||The garden of the empire to run waste.
U||Come see the Capulets and Montagues,
U||The Philippeschi and Monaldi! man
U||Who car’st for nought! those sunk in grief, and these
U||With dire suspicion rack’d. Come, cruel one!
U||Come and behold the’ oppression of the nobles,
U||And mark their injuries: and thou mayst see.
U||What safety Santafiore can supply.
U||Come and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,
U||Desolate widow! day and night with moans:
U||“My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?”
U||Come and behold what love among thy people:
U||And if no pity touches thee for us,
U||Come and blush for thine own report. For me,
U||If it be lawful, O Almighty Power,
U||Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified!
U||Are thy just eyes turn’d elsewhere? or is this
U||A preparation in the wond’rous depth
U||Of thy sage counsel made, for some good end,
U||Entirely from our reach of thought cut off?
U||So are the’ Italian cities all o’erthrong’d
U||With tyrants, and a great Marcellus made
U||Of every petty factious villager.
U||My Florence! thou mayst well remain unmov’d
U||At this digression, which affects not thee:
U||Thanks to thy people, who so wisely speed.
U||Many have justice in their heart, that long
U||Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow,
U||Or ere it dart unto its aim: but shine
U||Have it on their lip’s edge. Many refuse
U||To bear the common burdens: readier thine
U||Answer uneall’d, and cry, “Behold I stoop!”
U||Make thyself glad, for thou hast reason now,
U||Thou wealthy! thou at peace! thou wisdom-fraught!
U||Facts best witness if I speak the truth.
U||Athens and Lacedaemon, who of old
U||Enacted laws, for civil arts renown’d,
U||Made little progress in improving life
U||Tow’rds thee, who usest such nice subtlety,
U||That to the middle of November scarce
U||Reaches the thread thou in October weav’st.
U||How many times, within thy memory,
U||Customs, and laws, and coins, and offices
U||Have been by thee renew’d, and people chang’d!
U||If thou remember’st well and can’st see clear,
U||Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch,
U||Who finds no rest upon her down, but oft
U||Shifting her side, short respite seeks from pain.
U||CANTO VII
U||After their courteous greetings joyfully
U||Sev’n times exchang’d, Sordello backward drew
U||Exclaiming, “Who are ye?” “Before this mount
U||By spirits worthy of ascent to God
U||Was sought, my bones had by Octavius’ care
U||Been buried. I am Virgil, for no sin
U||Depriv’d of heav’n, except for lack of faith.”
U||So answer’d him in few my gentle guide.
U||As one, who aught before him suddenly
U||Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries
U||“It is yet is not,” wav’ring in belief;
U||Such he appear’d; then downward bent his eyes,
U||And drawing near with reverential step,
U||Caught him, where of mean estate might clasp
U||His lord. “Glory of Latium!” he exclaim’d,
U||“In whom our tongue its utmost power display’d!
U||Boast of my honor’d birth-place! what desert
U||Of mine, what favour rather undeserv’d,
U||Shows thee to me? If I to hear that voice
U||Am worthy, say if from below thou com’st
U||And from what cloister’s pale?”—“Through every orb
U||Of that sad region,” he reply’d, “thus far
U||Am I arriv’d, by heav’nly influence led
U||And with such aid I come. There is a place
U||There underneath, not made by torments sad,
U||But by dun shades alone; where mourning’s voice
U||Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs.”
U||There I with little innocents abide,
U||Who by death’s fangs were bitten, ere exempt
U||From human taint. There I with those abide,
U||Who the three holy virtues put not on,
U||But understood the rest, and without blame
U||Follow’d them all. But if thou know’st and canst,
U||Direct us, how we soonest may arrive,
U||Where Purgatory its true beginning takes.”
U||He answer’d thus: “We have no certain place
U||Assign’d us: upwards I may go or round,
U||Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide.
U||But thou beholdest now how day declines:
U||And upwards to proceed by night, our power
U||Excels: therefore it may be well to choose
U||A place of pleasant sojourn. To the right
U||Some spirits sit apart retir’d. If thou
U||Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps:
U||And thou wilt know them, not without delight.”
U||“How chances this?” was answer’d; “who so wish’d
U||To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr’d
U||By other, or through his own weakness fail?”
U||The good Sordello then, along the ground
U||Trailing his finger, spoke: “Only this line
U||Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun
U||Hath disappear’d; not that aught else impedes
U||Thy going upwards, save the shades of night.
U||These with the wont of power perplex the will.
U||With them thou haply mightst return beneath,
U||Or to and fro around the mountain’s side
U||Wander, while day is in the horizon shut.”
U||My master straight, as wond’ring at his speech,
U||Exclaim’d: “Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,
U||That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight.”
U||A little space we were remov’d from thence,
U||When I perceiv’d the mountain hollow’d out.
U||Ev’n as large valleys hollow’d out on earth,
U||“That way,” the’ escorting spirit cried, “we go,
U||Where in a bosom the high bank recedes:
U||And thou await renewal of the day.”
U||Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path
U||Led us traverse into the ridge’s side,
U||Where more than half the sloping edge expires.
U||Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refin’d,
U||And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood
U||Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds
U||But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers
U||Plac’d in that fair recess, in color all
U||Had been surpass’d, as great surpasses less.
U||Nor nature only there lavish’d her hues,
U||But of the sweetness of a thousand smells
U||A rare and undistinguish’d fragrance made.
U||“Salve Regina,” on the grass and flowers
U||Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit
U||Who not beyond the valley could be seen.
U||“Before the west’ring sun sink to his bed,”
U||Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn’d,
U||“’Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.
U||For from this eminence ye shall discern
U||Better the acts and visages of all,
U||Than in the nether vale among them mix’d.
U||He, who sits high above the rest, and seems
U||To have neglected that he should have done,
U||And to the others’ song moves not his lip,
U||The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal’d
U||The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,
U||So that by others she revives but slowly,
U||He, who with kindly visage comforts him,
U||Sway’d in that country, where the water springs,
U||That Moldaw’s river to the Elbe, and Elbe
U||Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:
U||Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth
U||Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,
U||Pamper’d with rank luxuriousness and ease.
U||And that one with the nose depress, who close
U||In counsel seems with him of gentle look,
U||Flying expir’d, with’ring the lily’s flower.
U||Look there how he doth knock against his breast!
U||The other ye behold, who for his cheek
U||Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs.
U||They are the father and the father-in-law
U||Of Gallia’s bane: his vicious life they know
U||And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.
U||“He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps
U||In song, with him of feature prominent,
U||With ev’ry virtue bore his girdle brac’d.
U||And if that stripling who behinds him sits,
U||King after him had liv’d, his virtue then
U||From vessel to like vessel had been pour’d;
U||Which may not of the other heirs be said.
U||By James and Frederick his realms are held;
U||Neither the better heritage obtains.
U||Rarely into the branches of the tree
U||Doth human worth mount up; and so ordains
U||He who bestows it, that as his free gift
U||It may be call’d. To Charles my words apply
U||No less than to his brother in the song;
U||Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.
U||So much that plant degenerates from its seed,
U||As more than Beatrice and Margaret
U||Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse.
U||“Behold the king of simple life and plain,
U||Harry of England, sitting there alone:
U||He through his branches better issue spreads.
U||“That one, who on the ground beneath the rest
U||Sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,
U||Us William, that brave Marquis, for whose cause
U||The deed of Alexandria and his war
U||Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep.”
U||CANTO VIII
U||Now was the hour that wakens fond desire
U||In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,
U||Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,
U||And pilgrim newly on his road with love
U||Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,
U||That seems to mourn for the expiring day:
U||When I, no longer taking heed to hear
U||Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark
U||One risen from its seat, which with its hand
U||Audience implor’d. Both palms it join’d and rais’d,
U||Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,
U||As telling God, “I care for naught beside.”
U||“Te Lucis Ante,” so devoutly then
U||Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,
U||That all my sense in ravishment was lost.
U||And the rest after, softly and devout,
U||Follow’d through all the hymn, with upward gaze
U||Directed to the bright supernal wheels.
U||Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:
U||For of so subtle texture is this veil,
U||That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark’d.
U||I saw that gentle band silently next
U||Look up, as if in expectation held,
U||Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high
U||I saw forth issuing descend beneath
U||Two angels with two flame-illumin’d swords,
U||Broken and mutilated at their points.
U||Green as the tender leaves but newly born,
U||Their vesture was, the which by wings as green
U||Beaten, they drew behind them, fann’d in air.
U||A little over us one took his stand,
U||The other lighted on the’ Opposing hill,
U||So that the troop were in the midst contain’d.
U||Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;
U||But in their visages the dazzled eye
U||Was lost, as faculty that by too much
U||Is overpower’d. “From Mary’s bosom both
U||Are come,” exclaim’d Sordello, “as a guard
U||Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,
U||The serpent.” Whence, not knowing by which path
U||He came, I turn’d me round, and closely press’d,
U||All frozen, to my leader’s trusted side.
U||Sordello paus’d not: “To the valley now
U||(For it is time) let us descend; and hold
U||Converse with those great shadows: haply much
U||Their sight may please ye.” Only three steps down
U||Methinks I measur’d, ere I was beneath,
U||And noted one who look’d as with desire
U||To know me. Time was now that air arrow dim;
U||Yet not so dim, that ’twixt his eyes and mine
U||It clear’d not up what was conceal’d before.
U||Mutually tow’rds each other we advanc’d.
U||Nino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,
U||When I perceiv’d thou wert not with the bad!
U||No salutation kind on either part
U||Was left unsaid. He then inquir’d: “How long
U||Since thou arrived’st at the mountain’s foot,
U||Over the distant waves?”—“O!” answer’d I,
U||“Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,
U||And still in my first life, thus journeying on,
U||The other strive to gain.” Soon as they heard
U||My words, he and Sordello backward drew,
U||As suddenly amaz’d. To Virgil one,
U||The other to a spirit turn’d, who near
U||Was seated, crying: “Conrad! up with speed:
U||Come, see what of his grace high God hath will’d.”
U||Then turning round to me: “By that rare mark
U||Of honour which thou ow’st to him, who hides
U||So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,
U||When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.
U||Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call
U||There, where reply to innocence is made.
U||Her mother, I believe, loves me no more;
U||Since she has chang’d the white and wimpled folds,
U||Which she is doom’d once more with grief to wish.
U||By her it easily may be perceiv’d,
U||How long in women lasts the flame of love,
U||If sight and touch do not relume it oft.
U||For her so fair a burial will not make
U||The viper which calls Milan to the field,
U||As had been made by shrill Gallura’s bird.”
U||He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp
U||Of that right seal, which with due temperature
U||Glows in the bosom. My insatiate eyes
U||Meanwhile to heav’n had travel’d, even there
U||Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel
U||Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir’d:
U||“What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?”
U||I answer’d: “The three torches, with which here
U||The pole is all on fire.” He then to me:
U||“The four resplendent stars, thou saw’st this morn
U||Are there beneath, and these ris’n in their stead.”
U||While yet he spoke. Sordello to himself
U||Drew him, and cry’d: “Lo there our enemy!”
U||And with his hand pointed that way to look.
U||Along the side, where barrier none arose
U||Around the little vale, a serpent lay,
U||Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.
U||Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake
U||Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;
U||And, as a beast that smoothes its polish’d coat,
U||Licking his hack. I saw not, nor can tell,
U||How those celestial falcons from their seat
U||Mov’d, but in motion each one well descried,
U||Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.
U||The serpent fled; and to their stations back
U||The angels up return’d with equal flight.
U||The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call’d,
U||Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken,
U||Through all that conflict, loosen’d not his sight.
U||“So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,
U||Find, in thy destin’d lot, of wax so much,
U||As may suffice thee to the enamel’s height.”
U||It thus began: “If any certain news
U||Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part
U||Thou know’st, tell me, who once was mighty there
U||They call’d me Conrad Malaspina, not
U||That old one, but from him I sprang. The love
U||I bore my people is now here refin’d.”
U||“In your dominions,” I answer’d, “ne’er was I.
U||But through all Europe where do those men dwell,
U||To whom their glory is not manifest?
U||The fame, that honours your illustrious house,
U||Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;
U||So that he knows it who was never there.
U||I swear to you, so may my upward route
U||Prosper! your honour’d nation not impairs
U||The value of her coffer and her sword.
U||Nature and use give her such privilege,
U||That while the world is twisted from his course
U||By a bad head, she only walks aright,
U||And has the evil way in scorn.” He then:
U||“Now pass thee on: sev’n times the tired sun
U||Revisits not the couch, which with four feet
U||The forked Aries covers, ere that kind
U||Opinion shall be nail’d into thy brain
U||With stronger nails than other’s speech can drive,
U||If the sure course of judgment be not stay’d.”
U||CANTO IX
U||Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,
U||Arisen from her mate’s beloved arms,
U||Look’d palely o’er the eastern cliff: her brow,
U||Lucent with jewels, glitter’d, set in sign
U||Of that chill animal, who with his train
U||Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,
U||Two steps of her ascent the night had past,
U||And now the third was closing up its wing,
U||When I, who had so much of Adam with me,
U||Sank down upon the grass, o’ercome with sleep,
U||There where all five were seated. In that hour,
U||When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,
U||Rememb’ring haply ancient grief, renews,
U||And with our minds more wand’rers from the flesh,
U||And less by thought restrain’d are, as ’t were, full
U||Of holy divination in their dreams,
U||Then in a vision did I seem to view
U||A golden-feather’d eagle in the sky,
U||With open wings, and hov’ring for descent,
U||And I was in that place, methought, from whence
U||Young Ganymede, from his associates ’reft,
U||Was snatch’d aloft to the high consistory.
U||“Perhaps,” thought I within me, “here alone
U||He strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains
U||To pounce upon the prey.” Therewith, it seem’d,
U||A little wheeling in his airy tour
U||Terrible as the lightning rush’d he down,
U||And snatch’d me upward even to the fire.
U||There both, I thought, the eagle and myself
U||Did burn; and so intense th’ imagin’d flames,
U||That needs my sleep was broken off. As erst
U||Achilles shook himself, and round him roll’d
U||His waken’d eyeballs wond’ring where he was,
U||Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled
U||To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;
U||E’en thus I shook me, soon as from my face
U||The slumber parted, turning deadly pale,
U||Like one ice-struck with dread. Solo at my side
U||My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now
U||More than two hours aloft: and to the sea
U||My looks were turn’d. “Fear not,” my master cried,
U||“Assur’d we are at happy point. Thy strength
U||Shrink not, but rise dilated. Thou art come
U||To Purgatory now. Lo! there the cliff
U||That circling bounds it! Lo! the entrance there,
U||Where it doth seem disparted! Ere the dawn
U||Usher’d the daylight, when thy wearied soul
U||Slept in thee, o’er the flowery vale beneath
U||A lady came, and thus bespake me: I
U||Am Lucia. Suffer me to take this man,
U||Who slumbers. Easier so his way shall speed.”
U||Sordello and the other gentle shapes
U||Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,
U||This summit reach’d: and I pursued her steps.
U||Here did she place thee. First her lovely eyes
U||That open entrance show’d me; then at once
U||She vanish’d with thy sleep.” Like one, whose doubts
U||Are chas’d by certainty, and terror turn’d
U||To comfort on discovery of the truth,
U||Such was the change in me: and as my guide
U||Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff
U||He mov’d, and I behind him, towards the height.
U||Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,
U||Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully
U||I prop the structure! Nearer now we drew,
U||Arriv’d’ whence in that part, where first a breach
U||As of a wall appear’d, I could descry
U||A portal, and three steps beneath, that led
U||For inlet there, of different colour each,
U||And one who watch’d, but spake not yet a word.
U||As more and more mine eye did stretch its view,
U||I mark’d him seated on the highest step,
U||In visage such, as past my power to bear.
U||Grasp’d in his hand a naked sword, glanc’d back
U||The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain
U||My sight directed. “Speak from whence ye stand:”
U||He cried: “What would ye? Where is your escort?
U||Take heed your coming upward harm ye not.”
U||“A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,”
U||Replied the’ instructor, “told us, even now,
U||‘Pass that way: here the gate is.”—“And may she
U||Befriending prosper your ascent,” resum’d
U||The courteous keeper of the gate: “Come then
U||Before our steps.” We straightway thither came.
U||The lowest stair was marble white so smooth
U||And polish’d, that therein my mirror’d form
U||Distinct I saw. The next of hue more dark
U||Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block,
U||Crack’d lengthwise and across. The third, that lay
U||Massy above, seem’d porphyry, that flam’d
U||Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.
U||On this God’s angel either foot sustain’d,
U||Upon the threshold seated, which appear’d
U||A rock of diamond. Up the trinal steps
U||My leader cheerily drew me. “Ask,” said he,
U||“With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt.”
U||Piously at his holy feet devolv’d
U||I cast me, praying him for pity’s sake
U||That he would open to me: but first fell
U||Thrice on my bosom prostrate. Seven times
U||The letter, that denotes the inward stain,
U||He on my forehead with the blunted point
U||Of his drawn sword inscrib’d. And “Look,” he cried,
U||“When enter’d, that thou wash these scars away.”
U||Ashes, or earth ta’en dry out of the ground,
U||Were of one colour with the robe he wore.
U||From underneath that vestment forth he drew
U||Two keys of metal twain: the one was gold,
U||Its fellow silver. With the pallid first,
U||And next the burnish’d, he so ply’d the gate,
U||As to content me well. “Whenever one
U||Faileth of these, that in the keyhole straight
U||It turn not, to this alley then expect
U||Access in vain.” Such were the words he spake.
U||“One is more precious: but the other needs
U||Skill and sagacity, large share of each,
U||Ere its good task to disengage the knot
U||Be worthily perform’d. From Peter these
U||I hold, of him instructed, that I err
U||Rather in opening than in keeping fast;
U||So but the suppliant at my feet implore.”
U||Then of that hallow’d gate he thrust the door,
U||Exclaiming, “Enter, but this warning hear:
U||He forth again departs who looks behind.”
U||As in the hinges of that sacred ward
U||The swivels turn’d, sonorous metal strong,
U||Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily
U||Roar’d the Tarpeian, when by force bereft
U||Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss
U||To leanness doom’d. Attentively I turn’d,
U||List’ning the thunder, that first issued forth;
U||And “We praise thee, O God,” methought I heard
U||In accents blended with sweet melody.
U||The strains came o’er mine ear, e’en as the sound
U||Of choral voices, that in solemn chant
U||With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,
U||Come swelling, now float indistinct away.
U||CANTO X
U||When we had passed the threshold of the gate
U||(Which the soul’s ill affection doth disuse,
U||Making the crooked seem the straighter path),
U||I heard its closing sound. Had mine eyes turn’d,
U||For that offence what plea might have avail’d?
U||We mounted up the riven rock, that wound
U||On either side alternate, as the wave
U||Flies and advances. “Here some little art
U||Behooves us,” said my leader, “that our steps
U||Observe the varying flexure of the path.”
U||Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb
U||The moon once more o’erhangs her wat’ry couch,
U||Ere we that strait have threaded. But when free
U||We came and open, where the mount above
U||One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,
U||And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,
U||Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads
U||That traverse desert wilds. From whence the brink
U||Borders upon vacuity, to foot
U||Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space
U||Had measur’d thrice the stature of a man:
U||And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,
U||To leftward now and now to right dispatch’d,
U||That cornice equal in extent appear’d.
U||Not yet our feet had on that summit mov’d,
U||When I discover’d that the bank around,
U||Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,
U||Was marble white, and so exactly wrought
U||With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone
U||Had Polycletus, but e’en nature’s self
U||Been sham’d. The angel who came down to earth
U||With tidings of the peace so many years
U||Wept for in vain, that op’d the heavenly gates
U||From their long interdict before us seem’d,
U||In a sweet act, so sculptur’d to the life,
U||He look’d no silent image. One had sworn
U||He had said, “Hail!” for she was imag’d there,
U||By whom the key did open to God’s love,
U||And in her act as sensibly impress
U||That word, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord,”
U||As figure seal’d on wax. “Fix not thy mind
U||On one place only,” said the guide belov’d,
U||Who had me near him on that part where lies
U||The heart of man. My sight forthwith I turn’d
U||And mark’d, behind the virgin mother’s form,
U||Upon that side, where he, that mov’d me, stood,
U||Another story graven on the rock.
U||I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,
U||That it might stand more aptly for my view.
U||There in the self-same marble were engrav’d
U||The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,
U||That from unbidden office awes mankind.
U||Before it came much people; and the whole
U||Parted in seven quires. One sense cried, “Nay,”
U||Another, “Yes, they sing.” Like doubt arose
U||Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl’d fume
U||Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.
U||Preceding the blest vessel, onward came
U||With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,
U||Sweet Israel’s harper: in that hap he seem’d
U||Less and yet more than kingly. Opposite,
U||At a great palace, from the lattice forth
U||Look’d Michol, like a lady full of scorn
U||And sorrow. To behold the tablet next,
U||Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,
U||I mov’d me. There was storied on the rock
U||The’ exalted glory of the Roman prince,
U||Whose mighty worth mov’d Gregory to earn
U||His mighty conquest, Trajan th’ Emperor.
U||A widow at his bridle stood, attir’d
U||In tears and mourning. Round about them troop’d
U||Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold
U||The eagles floated, struggling with the wind.
U||The wretch appear’d amid all these to say:
U||“Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart
U||My son is murder’d.” He replying seem’d;
U||“Wait now till I return.” And she, as one
U||Made hasty by her grief; “O sire, if thou
U||Dost not return?”—“Where I am, who then is,
U||May right thee.”—“What to thee is other’s good,
U||If thou neglect thy own?”—“Now comfort thee,”
U||At length he answers. “It beseemeth well
U||My duty be perform’d, ere I move hence:
U||So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.”
U||He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc’d
U||That visible speaking, new to us and strange
U||The like not found on earth. Fondly I gaz’d
U||Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,
U||Shapes yet more precious for their artist’s sake,
U||When “Lo,” the poet whisper’d, “where this way
U||(But slack their pace), a multitude advance.
U||These to the lofty steps shall guide us on.”
U||Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights
U||Their lov’d allurement, were not slow to turn.
U||Reader! I would not that amaz’d thou miss
U||Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God
U||Decrees our debts be cancel’d. Ponder not
U||The form of suff’ring. Think on what succeeds,
U||Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom
U||It cannot pass. “Instructor,” I began,
U||“What I see hither tending, bears no trace
U||Of human semblance, nor of aught beside
U||That my foil’d sight can guess.” He answering thus:
U||“So courb’d to earth, beneath their heavy teems
U||Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first
U||Struggled as thine. But look intently thither,
U||An disentangle with thy lab’ring view,
U||What underneath those stones approacheth: now,
U||E’en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each.”
U||Christians and proud! O poor and wretched ones!
U||That feeble in the mind’s eye, lean your trust
U||Upon unstaid perverseness! Know ye not
U||That we are worms, yet made at last to form
U||The winged insect, imp’d with angel plumes
U||That to heaven’s justice unobstructed soars?
U||Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg’d souls?
U||Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,
U||Like the untimely embryon of a worm!
U||As, to support incumbent floor or roof,
U||For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,
U||That crumples up its knees unto its breast,
U||With the feign’d posture stirring ruth unfeign’d
U||In the beholder’s fancy; so I saw
U||These fashion’d, when I noted well their guise.
U||Each, as his back was laden, came indeed
U||Or more or less contract; but it appear’d
U||As he, who show’d most patience in his look,
U||Wailing exclaim’d: “I can endure no more.”
U||CANTO XI
U||“O thou Almighty Father, who dost make
U||The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin’d,
U||But that with love intenser there thou view’st
U||Thy primal effluence, hallow’d be thy name:
U||Join each created being to extol
U||Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise
U||Is thy blest Spirit. May thy kingdom’s peace
U||Come unto us; for we, unless it come,
U||With all our striving thither tend in vain.
U||As of their will the angels unto thee
U||Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne
U||With loud hosannas, so of theirs be done
U||By saintly men on earth. Grant us this day
U||Our daily manna, without which he roams
U||Through this rough desert retrograde, who most
U||Toils to advance his steps. As we to each
U||Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou
U||Benign, and of our merit take no count.
U||’Gainst the old adversary prove thou not
U||Our virtue easily subdu’d; but free
U||From his incitements and defeat his wiles.
U||This last petition, dearest Lord! is made
U||Not for ourselves, since that were needless now,
U||But for their sakes who after us remain.”
U||Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring,
U||Those spirits went beneath a weight like that
U||We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,
U||But with unequal anguish, wearied all,
U||Round the first circuit, purging as they go,
U||The world’s gross darkness off: In our behalf
U||If there vows still be offer’d, what can here
U||For them be vow’d and done by such, whose wills
U||Have root of goodness in them? Well beseems
U||That we should help them wash away the stains
U||They carried hence, that so made pure and light,
U||They may spring upward to the starry spheres.
U||“Ah! so may mercy-temper’d justice rid
U||Your burdens speedily, that ye have power
U||To stretch your wing, which e’en to your desire
U||Shall lift you, as ye show us on which hand
U||Toward the ladder leads the shortest way.
U||And if there be more passages than one,
U||Instruct us of that easiest to ascend;
U||For this man who comes with me, and bears yet
U||The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,
U||Despite his better will but slowly mounts.”
U||From whom the answer came unto these words,
U||Which my guide spake, appear’d not; but ’twas said.
U||“Along the bank to rightward come with us,
U||And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil
U||Of living man to climb: and were it not
U||That I am hinder’d by the rock, wherewith
U||This arrogant neck is tam’d, whence needs I stoop
U||My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,
U||Whose name thou speak’st not him I fain would view.
U||To mark if e’er I knew him? and to crave
U||His pity for the fardel that I bear.
U||I was of Latiun, of a Tuscan horn
U||A mighty one: Aldobranlesco’s name
U||My sire’s, I know not if ye e’er have heard.
U||My old blood and forefathers’ gallant deeds
U||Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot
U||The common mother, and to such excess,
U||Wax’d in my scorn of all men, that I fell,
U||Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna’s sons,
U||Each child in Campagnatico, can tell.
U||I am Omberto; not me only pride
U||Hath injur’d, but my kindred all involv’d
U||In mischief with her. Here my lot ordains
U||Under this weight to groan, till I appease
U||God’s angry justice, since I did it not
U||Amongst the living, here amongst the dead.”
U||List’ning I bent my visage down: and one
U||(Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight
U||That urg’d him, saw me, knew me straight, and call’d,
U||Holding his eyes With difficulty fix’d
U||Intent upon me, stooping as I went
U||Companion of their way. “O!” I exclaim’d,
U||“Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou
U||Agobbio’s glory, glory of that art
U||Which they of Paris call the limmer’s skill?”
U||“Brother!” said he, “with tints that gayer smile,
U||Bolognian Franco’s pencil lines the leaves.
U||His all the honour now; mine borrow’d light.
U||In truth I had not been thus courteous to him,
U||The whilst I liv’d, through eagerness of zeal
U||For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.
U||Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid.
U||Nor were I even here; if, able still
U||To sin, I had not turn’d me unto God.
U||O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp’d
U||E’en in its height of verdure, if an age
U||Less bright succeed not! Cimabue thought
U||To lord it over painting’s field; and now
U||The cry is Giotto’s, and his name eclips’d.
U||Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch’d
U||The letter’d prize: and he perhaps is born,
U||Who shall drive either from their nest. The noise
U||Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,
U||That blows from divers points, and shifts its name
U||Shifting the point it blows from. Shalt thou more
U||Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh
U||Part shrivel’d from thee, than if thou hadst died,
U||Before the coral and the pap were left,
U||Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that
U||Is, to eternity compar’d, a space,
U||Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye
U||To the heaven’s slowest orb. He there who treads
U||So leisurely before me, far and wide
U||Through Tuscany resounded once; and now
U||Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam’d:
U||There was he sov’reign, when destruction caught
U||The madd’ning rage of Florence, in that day
U||Proud as she now is loathsome. Your renown
U||Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,
U||And his might withers it, by whom it sprang
U||Crude from the lap of earth.” I thus to him:
U||“True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe
U||The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay
U||What tumours rankle there. But who is he
U||Of whom thou spak’st but now?”—“This,” he replied,
U||“Is Provenzano. He is here, because
U||He reach’d, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway
U||Of all Sienna. Thus he still hath gone,
U||Thus goeth never-resting, since he died.
U||Such is th’ acquittance render’d back of him,
U||Who, beyond measure, dar’d on earth.” I then:
U||“If soul that to the verge of life delays
U||Repentance, linger in that lower space,
U||Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,
U||How chanc’d admittance was vouchsaf’d to him?”
U||“When at his glory’s topmost height,” said he,
U||“Respect of dignity all cast aside,
U||Freely He fix’d him on Sienna’s plain,
U||A suitor to redeem his suff’ring friend,
U||Who languish’d in the prison-house of Charles,
U||Nor for his sake refus’d through every vein
U||To tremble. More I will not say; and dark,
U||I know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon
U||Shall help thee to a comment on the text.
U||This is the work, that from these limits freed him.”
U||CANTO XII
U||With equal pace as oxen in the yoke,
U||I with that laden spirit journey’d on
U||Long as the mild instructor suffer’d me;
U||But when he bade me quit him, and proceed
U||(For “here,” said he, “behooves with sail and oars
U||Each man, as best he may, push on his bark”),
U||Upright, as one dispos’d for speed, I rais’d
U||My body, still in thought submissive bow’d.
U||I now my leader’s track not loth pursued;
U||And each had shown how light we far’d along
U||When thus he warn’d me: “Bend thine eyesight down:
U||For thou to ease the way shall find it good
U||To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.”
U||As in memorial of the buried, drawn
U||Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur’d form
U||Of what was once, appears (at sight whereof
U||Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak’d,
U||Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel),
U||So saw I there, but with more curious skill
U||Of portraiture o’erwrought, whate’er of space
U||From forth the mountain stretches. On one part
U||Him I beheld, above all creatures erst
U||Created noblest, light’ning fall from heaven:
U||On th’ other side with bolt celestial pierc’d
U||Briareus: cumb’ring earth he lay through dint
U||Of mortal ice-stroke. The Thymbraean god
U||With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,
U||Arm’d still, and gazing on the giant’s limbs
U||Strewn o’er th’ ethereal field. Nimrod I saw:
U||At foot of the stupendous work he stood,
U||As if bewilder’d, looking on the crowd
U||Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar’s plain.
U||O Niobe! in what a trance of woe
U||Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,
U||Sev’n sons on either side thee slain! O Saul!
U||How ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword
U||Expiring in Gilboa, from that hour
U||Ne’er visited with rain from heav’n or dew!
U||O fond Arachne! thee I also saw
U||Half spider now in anguish crawling up
U||Th’ unfinish’d web thou weaved’st to thy bane!
U||O Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem
U||Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote
U||With none to chase him in his chariot whirl’d.
U||Was shown beside upon the solid floor
U||How dear Alcmaeon forc’d his mother rate
U||That ornament in evil hour receiv’d:
U||How in the temple on Sennacherib fell
U||His sons, and how a corpse they left him there.
U||Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made
U||By Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:
U||“Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!”
U||Was shown how routed in the battle fled
U||Th’ Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e’en
U||The relics of the carnage. Troy I mark’d
U||In ashes and in caverns. Oh! how fall’n,
U||How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!
U||What master of the pencil or the style
U||Had trac’d the shades and lines, that might have made
U||The subtlest workman wonder? Dead the dead,
U||The living seem’d alive; with clearer view
U||His eye beheld not who beheld the truth,
U||Than mine what I did tread on, while I went
U||Low bending. Now swell out; and with stiff necks
U||Pass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks,
U||Lest they descry the evil of your path!
U||I noted not (so busied was my thought)
U||How much we now had circled of the mount,
U||And of his course yet more the sun had spent,
U||When he, who with still wakeful caution went,
U||Admonish’d: “Raise thou up thy head: for know
U||Time is not now for slow suspense. Behold
U||That way an angel hasting towards us! Lo
U||Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return
U||From service on the day. Wear thou in look
U||And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe,
U||That gladly he may forward us aloft.
U||Consider that this day ne’er dawns again.”
U||Time’s loss he had so often warn’d me ’gainst,
U||I could not miss the scope at which he aim’d.
U||The goodly shape approach’d us, snowy white
U||In vesture, and with visage casting streams
U||Of tremulous lustre like the matin star.
U||His arms he open’d, then his wings; and spake:
U||“Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now
U||Th’ ascent is without difficulty gain’d.”
U||A scanty few are they, who when they hear
U||Such tidings, hasten. O ye race of men
U||Though born to soar, why suffer ye a wind
U||So slight to baffle ye? He led us on
U||Where the rock parted; here against my front
U||Did beat his wings, then promis’d I should fare
U||In safety on my way. As to ascend
U||That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands
U||(O’er Rubaconte, looking lordly down
U||On the well-guided city,) up the right
U||Th’ impetuous rise is broken by the steps
U||Carv’d in that old and simple age, when still
U||The registry and label rested safe;
U||Thus is th’ acclivity reliev’d, which here
U||Precipitous from the other circuit falls:
U||But on each hand the tall cliff presses close.
U||As ent’ring there we turn’d, voices, in strain
U||Ineffable, sang: “Blessed are the poor
U||In spirit.” Ah how far unlike to these
U||The straits of hell; here songs to usher us,
U||There shrieks of woe! We climb the holy stairs:
U||And lighter to myself by far I seem’d
U||Than on the plain before, whence thus I spake:
U||“Say, master, of what heavy thing have I
U||Been lighten’d, that scarce aught the sense of toil
U||Affects me journeying?” He in few replied:
U||“When sin’s broad characters, that yet remain
U||Upon thy temples, though well nigh effac’d,
U||Shall be, as one is, all clean razed out,
U||Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will
U||Be so o’ercome, they not alone shall feel
U||No sense of labour, but delight much more
U||Shall wait them urg’d along their upward way.”
U||Then like to one, upon whose head is plac’d
U||Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks
U||Of others as they pass him by; his hand
U||Lends therefore help to’ assure him, searches, finds,
U||And well performs such office as the eye
U||Wants power to execute: so stretching forth
U||The fingers of my right hand, did I find
U||Six only of the letters, which his sword
U||Who bare the keys had trac’d upon my brow.
U||The leader, as he mark’d mine action, smil’d.
U||CANTO XIII
U||We reach’d the summit of the scale, and stood
U||Upon the second buttress of that mount
U||Which healeth him who climbs. A cornice there,
U||Like to the former, girdles round the hill;
U||Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends.
U||Shadow nor image there is seen; all smooth
U||The rampart and the path, reflecting nought
U||But the rock’s sullen hue. “If here we wait
U||For some to question,” said the bard, “I fear
U||Our choice may haply meet too long delay.”
U||Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes
U||He fastn’d, made his right the central point
U||From whence to move, and turn’d the left aside.
U||“O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,
U||Conduct us thou,” he cried, “on this new way,
U||Where now I venture, leading to the bourn
U||We seek. The universal world to thee
U||Owes warmth and lustre. If no other cause
U||Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.”
U||Far, as is measur’d for a mile on earth,
U||In brief space had we journey’d; such prompt will
U||Impell’d; and towards us flying, now were heard
U||Spirits invisible, who courteously
U||Unto love’s table bade the welcome guest.
U||The voice, that first? flew by, call’d forth aloud,
U||“They have no wine;” so on behind us past,
U||Those sounds reiterating, nor yet lost
U||In the faint distance, when another came
U||Crying, “I am Orestes,” and alike
U||Wing’d its fleet way. “Oh father!” I exclaim’d,
U||“What tongues are these?” and as I question’d, lo!
U||A third exclaiming, “Love ye those have wrong’d you.”
U||“This circuit,” said my teacher, “knots the scourge
U||For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn
U||By charity’s correcting hand. The curb
U||Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear
U||(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,
U||Where pardon sets them free. But fix thine eyes
U||Intently through the air, and thou shalt see
U||A multitude before thee seated, each
U||Along the shelving grot.” Then more than erst
U||I op’d my eyes, before me view’d, and saw
U||Shadows with garments dark as was the rock;
U||And when we pass’d a little forth, I heard
U||A crying, “Blessed Mary! pray for us,
U||Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!”
U||I do not think there walks on earth this day
U||Man so remorseless, that he hath not yearn’d
U||With pity at the sight that next I saw.
U||Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now
U||I stood so near them, that their semblances
U||Came clearly to my view. Of sackcloth vile
U||Their cov’ring seem’d; and on his shoulder one
U||Did stay another, leaning, and all lean’d
U||Against the cliff. E’en thus the blind and poor,
U||Near the confessionals, to crave an alms,
U||Stand, each his head upon his fellow’s sunk,
U||So most to stir compassion, not by sound
U||Of words alone, but that, which moves not less,
U||The sight of mis’ry. And as never beam
U||Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man,
U||E’en so was heav’n a niggard unto these
U||Of his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,
U||A thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,
U||As for the taming of a haggard hawk.
U||It were a wrong, methought, to pass and look
U||On others, yet myself the while unseen.
U||To my sage counsel therefore did I turn.
U||He knew the meaning of the mute appeal,
U||Nor waited for my questioning, but said:
U||“Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.”
U||On that part of the cornice, whence no rim
U||Engarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;
U||On the’ other side me were the spirits, their cheeks
U||Bathing devout with penitential tears,
U||That through the dread impalement forc’d a way.
U||I turn’d me to them, and “O shades!” said I,
U||“Assur’d that to your eyes unveil’d shall shine
U||The lofty light, sole object of your wish,
U||So may heaven’s grace clear whatsoe’er of foam
U||Floats turbid on the conscience, that thenceforth
U||The stream of mind roll limpid from its source,
U||As ye declare (for so shall ye impart
U||A boon I dearly prize) if any soul
U||Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance
U||That soul may profit, if I learn so much.”
U||“My brother, we are each one citizens
U||Of one true city. Any thou wouldst say,
U||Who lived a stranger in Italia’s land.”
U||So heard I answering, as appeal’d, a voice
U||That onward came some space from whence I stood.
U||A spirit I noted, in whose look was mark’d
U||Expectance. Ask ye how? The chin was rais’d
U||As in one reft of sight. “Spirit,” said I,
U||“Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be
U||That which didst answer to me,) or by place
U||Or name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee.”
U||“I was,” it answer’d, “of Sienna: here
U||I cleanse away with these the evil life,
U||Soliciting with tears that He, who is,
U||Vouchsafe him to us. Though Sapia nam’d
U||In sapience I excell’d not, gladder far
U||Of others’ hurt, than of the good befell me.
U||That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not,
U||Hear, if my folly were not as I speak it.
U||When now my years slop’d waning down the arch,
U||It so bechanc’d, my fellow citizens
U||Near Colle met their enemies in the field,
U||And I pray’d God to grant what He had will’d.
U||There were they vanquish’d, and betook themselves
U||Unto the bitter passages of flight.
U||I mark’d the hunt, and waxing out of bounds
U||In gladness, lifted up my shameless brow,
U||And like the merlin cheated by a gleam,
U||Cried, “It is over. Heav’n! I fear thee not.”
U||Upon my verge of life I wish’d for peace
U||With God; nor repentance had supplied
U||What I did lack of duty, were it not
U||The hermit Piero, touch’d with charity,
U||In his devout orisons thought on me.
U||“But who art thou that question’st of our state,
U||Who go’st to my belief, with lids unclos’d,
U||And breathest in thy talk?”—“Mine eyes,” said I,
U||“May yet be here ta’en from me; but not long;
U||For they have not offended grievously
U||With envious glances. But the woe beneath
U||Urges my soul with more exceeding dread.
U||That nether load already weighs me down.”
U||She thus: “Who then amongst us here aloft
U||Hath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?
U||“He,” answer’d I, “who standeth mute beside me.
U||I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,
U||If thou desire I yonder yet should move
U||For thee my mortal feet.”—“Oh!” she replied,
U||“This is so strange a thing, it is great sign
U||That God doth love thee. Therefore with thy prayer
U||Sometime assist me: and by that I crave,
U||Which most thou covetest, that if thy feet
U||E’er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame
U||Amongst my kindred. Them shalt thou behold
U||With that vain multitude, who set their hope
U||On Telamone’s haven, there to fail
U||Confounded, more shall when the fancied stream
U||They sought of Dian call’d: but they who lead
U||Their navies, more than ruin’d hopes shall mourn.”
U||CANTO XIV
U||“Say who is he around our mountain winds,
U||Or ever death has prun’d his wing for flight,
U||That opes his eyes and covers them at will?”
U||“I know not who he is, but know thus much
U||He comes not singly. Do thou ask of him,
U||For thou art nearer to him, and take heed
U||Accost him gently, so that he may speak.”
U||Thus on the right two Spirits bending each
U||Toward the other, talk’d of me, then both
U||Addressing me, their faces backward lean’d,
U||And thus the one began: “O soul, who yet
U||Pent in the body, tendest towards the sky!
U||For charity, we pray thee’ comfort us,
U||Recounting whence thou com’st, and who thou art:
U||For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee
U||Marvel, as at a thing that ne’er hath been.”
U||“There stretches through the midst of Tuscany,”
U||I straight began: “a brooklet, whose well-head
U||Springs up in Falterona, with his race
U||Not satisfied, when he some hundred miles
U||Hath measur’d. From his banks bring, I this frame.
U||To tell you who I am were words misspent:
U||For yet my name scarce sounds on rumour’s lip.”
U||“If well I do incorp’rate with my thought
U||The meaning of thy speech,” said he, who first
U||Addrest me, “thou dost speak of Arno’s wave.”
U||To whom the other: “Why hath he conceal’d
U||The title of that river, as a man
U||Doth of some horrible thing?” The spirit, who
U||Thereof was question’d, did acquit him thus:
U||“I know not: but ’tis fitting well the name
U||Should perish of that vale; for from the source
U||Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep
U||Maim’d of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass
U||Beyond that limit,) even to the point
U||Whereunto ocean is restor’d, what heaven
U||Drains from th’ exhaustless store for all earth’s streams,
U||Throughout the space is virtue worried down,
U||As ’twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,
U||Or through disastrous influence on the place,
U||Or else distortion of misguided wills,
U||That custom goads to evil: whence in those,
U||The dwellers in that miserable vale,
U||Nature is so transform’d, it seems as they
U||Had shar’d of Circe’s feeding. ’Midst brute swine,
U||Worthier of acorns than of other food
U||Created for man’s use, he shapeth first
U||His obscure way; then, sloping onward, finds
U||Curs, snarlers more in spite than power, from whom
U||He turns with scorn aside: still journeying down,
U||By how much more the curst and luckless foss
U||Swells out to largeness, e’en so much it finds
U||Dogs turning into wolves. Descending still
U||Through yet more hollow eddies, next he meets
U||A race of foxes, so replete with craft,
U||They do not fear that skill can master it.
U||Nor will I cease because my words are heard
U||By other ears than thine. It shall be well
U||For this man, if he keep in memory
U||What from no erring Spirit I reveal.
U||Lo! I behold thy grandson, that becomes
U||A hunter of those wolves, upon the shore
U||Of the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread:
U||Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale,
U||Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms.
U||Many of life he reaves, himself of worth
U||And goodly estimation. Smear’d with gore
U||Mark how he issues from the rueful wood,
U||Leaving such havoc, that in thousand years
U||It spreads not to prime lustihood again.”
U||As one, who tidings hears of woe to come,
U||Changes his looks perturb’d, from whate’er part
U||The peril grasp him, so beheld I change
U||That spirit, who had turn’d to listen, struck
U||With sadness, soon as he had caught the word.
U||His visage and the other’s speech did raise
U||Desire in me to know the names of both,
U||whereof with meek entreaty I inquir’d.
U||The shade, who late addrest me, thus resum’d:
U||“Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do
U||For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine.
U||But since God’s will is that so largely shine
U||His grace in thee, I will be liberal too.
U||Guido of Duca know then that I am.
U||Envy so parch’d my blood, that had I seen
U||A fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark’d
U||A livid paleness overspread my cheek.
U||Such harvest reap I of the seed I sow’d.
U||O man, why place thy heart where there doth need
U||Exclusion of participants in good?
U||This is Rinieri’s spirit, this the boast
U||And honour of the house of Calboli,
U||Where of his worth no heritage remains.
U||Nor his the only blood, that hath been stript
U||(’twixt Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore,)
U||Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss;
U||But in those limits such a growth has sprung
U||Of rank and venom’d roots, as long would mock
U||Slow culture’s toil. Where is good Lizio? where
U||Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna?
U||O bastard slips of old Romagna’s line!
U||When in Bologna the low artisan,
U||And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts,
U||A gentle cyon from ignoble stem.
U||Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep,
U||When I recall to mind those once lov’d names,
U||Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him
U||That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop,
U||With Traversaro’s house and Anastagio’s,
U||(Each race disherited) and beside these,
U||The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease,
U||That witch’d us into love and courtesy;
U||Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.
U||O Brettinoro! wherefore tarriest still,
U||Since forth of thee thy family hath gone,
U||And many, hating evil, join’d their steps?
U||Well doeth he, that bids his lineage cease,
U||Bagnacavallo; Castracaro ill,
U||And Conio worse, who care to propagate
U||A race of Counties from such blood as theirs.
U||Well shall ye also do, Pagani, then
U||When from amongst you tries your demon child.
U||Not so, howe’er, that henceforth there remain
U||True proof of what ye were. O Hugolin!
U||Thou sprung of Fantolini’s line! thy name
U||Is safe, since none is look’d for after thee
U||To cloud its lustre, warping from thy stock.
U||But, Tuscan, go thy ways; for now I take
U||Far more delight in weeping than in words.
U||Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart.”
U||We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard
U||Our steps. Their silence therefore of our way
U||Assur’d us. Soon as we had quitted them,
U||Advancing onward, lo! a voice that seem’d
U||Like vollied light’ning, when it rives the air,
U||Met us, and shouted, “Whosoever finds
U||Will slay me,” then fled from us, as the bolt
U||Lanc’d sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.
U||When it had giv’n short truce unto our hearing,
U||Behold the other with a crash as loud
U||As the quick-following thunder: “Mark in me
U||Aglauros turn’d to rock.” I at the sound
U||Retreating drew more closely to my guide.
U||Now in mute stillness rested all the air:
U||And thus he spake: “There was the galling bit.
U||But your old enemy so baits his hook,
U||He drags you eager to him. Hence nor curb
U||Avails you, nor reclaiming call. Heav’n calls
U||And round about you wheeling courts your gaze
U||With everlasting beauties. Yet your eye
U||Turns with fond doting still upon the earth.
U||Therefore He smites you who discerneth all.”
U||CANTO XV
U||As much as ’twixt the third hour’s close and dawn,
U||Appeareth of heav’n’s sphere, that ever whirls
U||As restless as an infant in his play,
U||So much appear’d remaining to the sun
U||Of his slope journey towards the western goal.
U||Evening was there, and here the noon of night;
U||and full upon our forehead smote the beams.
U||For round the mountain, circling, so our path
U||Had led us, that toward the sun-set now
U||Direct we journey’d: when I felt a weight
U||Of more exceeding splendour, than before,
U||Press on my front. The cause unknown, amaze
U||Possess’d me, and both hands against my brow
U||Lifting, I interpos’d them, as a screen,
U||That of its gorgeous superflux of light
U||Clipp’d the diminish’d orb. As when the ray,
U||Striking On water or the surface clear
U||Of mirror, leaps unto the opposite part,
U||Ascending at a glance, e’en as it fell,
U||(And so much differs from the stone, that falls)
U||Through equal space, as practice skill hath shown;
U||Thus with refracted light before me seemed
U||The ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste
U||My sight recoil’d. “What is this, sire belov’d!
U||’Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?”
U||Cried I, “and which towards us moving seems?”
U||“Marvel not, if the family of heav’n,”
U||He answer’d, “yet with dazzling radiance dim
U||Thy sense it is a messenger who comes,
U||Inviting man’s ascent. Such sights ere long,
U||Not grievous, shall impart to thee delight,
U||As thy perception is by nature wrought
U||Up to their pitch.” The blessed angel, soon
U||As we had reach’d him, hail’d us with glad voice:
U||“Here enter on a ladder far less steep
U||Than ye have yet encounter’d.” We forthwith
U||Ascending, heard behind us chanted sweet,
U||“Blessed the merciful,” and “happy thou!
U||That conquer’st.” Lonely each, my guide and I
U||Pursued our upward way; and as we went,
U||Some profit from his words I hop’d to win,
U||And thus of him inquiring, fram’d my speech:
U||“What meant Romagna’s spirit, when he spake
U||Of bliss exclusive with no partner shar’d?”
U||He straight replied: “No wonder, since he knows,
U||What sorrow waits on his own worst defect,
U||If he chide others, that they less may mourn.
U||Because ye point your wishes at a mark,
U||Where, by communion of possessors, part
U||Is lessen’d, envy bloweth up the sighs of men.
U||No fear of that might touch ye, if the love
U||Of higher sphere exalted your desire.
U||For there, by how much more they call it ours,
U||So much propriety of each in good
U||Increases more, and heighten’d charity
U||Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame.”
U||“Now lack I satisfaction more,” said I,
U||“Than if thou hadst been silent at the first,
U||And doubt more gathers on my lab’ring thought.
U||How can it chance, that good distributed,
U||The many, that possess it, makes more rich,
U||Than if ’t were shar’d by few?” He answering thus:
U||“Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth,
U||Strikes darkness from true light. The highest good
U||Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed
U||To love, as beam to lucid body darts,
U||Giving as much of ardour as it finds.
U||The sempiternal effluence streams abroad
U||Spreading, wherever charity extends.
U||So that the more aspirants to that bliss
U||Are multiplied, more good is there to love,
U||And more is lov’d; as mirrors, that reflect,
U||Each unto other, propagated light.
U||If these my words avail not to allay
U||Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,
U||Who of this want, and of all else thou hast,
U||Shall rid thee to the full. Provide but thou
U||That from thy temples may be soon eras’d,
U||E’en as the two already, those five scars,
U||That when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal,”
U||“Thou,” I had said, “content’st me,” when I saw
U||The other round was gain’d, and wond’ring eyes
U||Did keep me mute. There suddenly I seem’d
U||By an ecstatic vision wrapt away;
U||And in a temple saw, methought, a crowd
U||Of many persons; and at th’ entrance stood
U||A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express
U||A mother’s love, who said, “Child! why hast thou
U||Dealt with us thus? Behold thy sire and I
U||Sorrowing have sought thee;” and so held her peace,
U||And straight the vision fled. A female next
U||Appear’d before me, down whose visage cours’d
U||Those waters, that grief forces out from one
U||By deep resentment stung, who seem’d to say:
U||“If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed
U||Over this city, nam’d with such debate
U||Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,
U||Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace
U||Hath clasp’d our daughter; “and to fuel, meseem’d,
U||Benign and meek, with visage undisturb’d,
U||Her sovran spake: “How shall we those requite,
U||Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn
U||The man that loves us?” After that I saw
U||A multitude, in fury burning, slay
U||With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain
U||“Destroy, destroy!” and him I saw, who bow’d
U||Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made
U||His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav’n,
U||Praying forgiveness of th’ Almighty Sire,
U||Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,
U||With looks, that With compassion to their aim.
U||Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight
U||Returning, sought again the things, whose truth
U||Depends not on her shaping, I observ’d
U||How she had rov’d to no unreal scenes
U||Meanwhile the leader, who might see I mov’d,
U||As one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,
U||Exclaim’d: “What ails thee, that thou canst not hold
U||Thy footing firm, but more than half a league
U||Hast travel’d with clos’d eyes and tott’ring gait,
U||Like to a man by wine or sleep o’ercharg’d?”
U||“Beloved father! so thou deign,” said I,
U||“To listen, I will tell thee what appear’d
U||Before me, when so fail’d my sinking steps.”
U||He thus: “Not if thy Countenance were mask’d
U||With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine
U||How small soe’er, elude me. What thou saw’st
U||Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart
U||To the waters of peace, that flow diffus’d
U||From their eternal fountain. I not ask’d,
U||What ails thee? for such cause as he doth, who
U||Looks only with that eye which sees no more,
U||When spiritless the body lies; but ask’d,
U||To give fresh vigour to thy foot. Such goads
U||The slow and loit’ring need; that they be found
U||Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns.”
U||So on we journey’d through the evening sky
U||Gazing intent, far onward, as our eyes
U||With level view could stretch against the bright
U||Vespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees
U||Gath’ring, a fog made tow’rds us, dark as night.
U||There was no room for ’scaping; and that mist
U||Bereft us, both of sight and the pure air.
U||CANTO XVI
U||Hell’s dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,
U||Of every planes ’reft, and pall’d in clouds,
U||Did never spread before the sight a veil
U||In thickness like that fog, nor to the sense
U||So palpable and gross. Ent’ring its shade,
U||Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids;
U||Which marking, near me drew the faithful guide,
U||Offering me his shoulder for a stay.
U||As the blind man behind his leader walks,
U||Lest he should err, or stumble unawares
U||On what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,
U||I journey’d through that bitter air and foul,
U||Still list’ning to my escort’s warning voice,
U||“Look that from me thou part not.” Straight I heard
U||Voices, and each one seem’d to pray for peace,
U||And for compassion, to the Lamb of God
U||That taketh sins away. Their prelude still
U||Was “Agnus Dei,” and through all the choir,
U||One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem’d
U||The concord of their song. “Are these I hear
U||Spirits, O master?” I exclaim’d; and he:
U||“Thou aim’st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.”
U||“Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?
U||And speak’st of us, as thou thyself e’en yet
U||Dividest time by calends?” So one voice
U||Bespake me; whence my master said: “Reply;
U||And ask, if upward hence the passage lead.”
U||“O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand
U||Beautiful once more in thy Maker’s sight!
U||Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder.”
U||Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:
U||“Long as ’t is lawful for me, shall my steps
U||Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke
U||Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead
U||Shall keep us join’d.” I then forthwith began
U||“Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend
U||To higher regions, and am hither come
U||Through the fearful agony of hell.
U||And, if so largely God hath doled his grace,
U||That, clean beside all modern precedent,
U||He wills me to behold his kingly state,
U||From me conceal not who thou wast, ere death
U||Had loos’d thee; but instruct me: and instruct
U||If rightly to the pass I tend; thy words
U||The way directing as a safe escort.”
U||“I was of Lombardy, and Marco call’d:
U||Not inexperienc’d of the world, that worth
U||I still affected, from which all have turn’d
U||The nerveless bow aside. Thy course tends right
U||Unto the summit:” and, replying thus,
U||He added, “I beseech thee pray for me,
U||When thou shalt come aloft.” And I to him:
U||“Accept my faith for pledge I will perform
U||What thou requirest. Yet one doubt remains,
U||That wrings me sorely, if I solve it not,
U||Singly before it urg’d me, doubled now
U||By thine opinion, when I couple that
U||With one elsewhere declar’d, each strength’ning other.
U||The world indeed is even so forlorn
U||Of all good as thou speak’st it and so swarms
U||With every evil. Yet, beseech thee, point
U||The cause out to me, that myself may see,
U||And unto others show it: for in heaven
U||One places it, and one on earth below.”
U||Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,
U||“Brother!” he thus began, “the world is blind;
U||And thou in truth com’st from it. Ye, who live,
U||Do so each cause refer to heav’n above,
U||E’en as its motion of necessity
U||Drew with it all that moves. If this were so,
U||Free choice in you were none; nor justice would
U||There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill.
U||Your movements have their primal bent from heaven;
U||Not all; yet said I all; what then ensues?
U||Light have ye still to follow evil or good,
U||And of the will free power, which, if it stand
U||Firm and unwearied in Heav’n’s first assay,
U||Conquers at last, so it be cherish’d well,
U||Triumphant over all. To mightier force,
U||To better nature subject, ye abide
U||Free, not constrain’d by that, which forms in you
U||The reasoning mind uninfluenc’d of the stars.
U||If then the present race of mankind err,
U||Seek in yourselves the cause, and find it there.
U||Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy.
U||“Forth from his plastic hand, who charm’d beholds
U||Her image ere she yet exist, the soul
U||Comes like a babe, that wantons sportively
U||Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods,
U||As artless and as ignorant of aught,
U||Save that her Maker being one who dwells
U||With gladness ever, willingly she turns
U||To whate’er yields her joy. Of some slight good
U||The flavour soon she tastes; and, snar’d by that,
U||With fondness she pursues it, if no guide
U||Recall, no rein direct her wand’ring course.
U||Hence it behov’d, the law should be a curb;
U||A sovereign hence behov’d, whose piercing view
U||Might mark at least the fortress and main tower
U||Of the true city. Laws indeed there are:
U||But who is he observes them? None; not he,
U||Who goes before, the shepherd of the flock,
U||Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.
U||Therefore the multitude, who see their guide
U||Strike at the very good they covet most,
U||Feed there and look no further. Thus the cause
U||Is not corrupted nature in yourselves,
U||But ill-conducting, that hath turn’d the world
U||To evil. Rome, that turn’d it unto good,
U||Was wont to boast two suns, whose several beams
U||Cast light on either way, the world’s and God’s.
U||One since hath quench’d the other; and the sword
U||Is grafted on the crook; and so conjoin’d
U||Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw’d
U||By fear of other. If thou doubt me, mark
U||The blade: each herb is judg’d of by its seed.
U||That land, through which Adice and the Po
U||Their waters roll, was once the residence
U||Of courtesy and velour, ere the day,
U||That frown’d on Frederick; now secure may pass
U||Those limits, whosoe’er hath left, for shame,
U||To talk with good men, or come near their haunts.
U||Three aged ones are still found there, in whom
U||The old time chides the new: these deem it long
U||Ere God restore them to a better world:
U||The good Gherardo, of Palazzo he
U||Conrad, and Guido of Castello, nam’d
U||In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.
U||On this at last conclude. The church of Rome,
U||Mixing two governments that ill assort,
U||Hath miss’d her footing, fall’n into the mire,
U||And there herself and burden much defil’d.”
U||“O Marco!” I replied, shine arguments
U||Convince me: and the cause I now discern
U||Why of the heritage no portion came
U||To Levi’s offspring. But resolve me this
U||Who that Gherardo is, that as thou sayst
U||Is left a sample of the perish’d race,
U||And for rebuke to this untoward age?”
U||“Either thy words,” said he, “deceive; or else
U||Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,
U||Appear’st not to have heard of good Gherado;
U||The sole addition that, by which I know him;
U||Unless I borrow’d from his daughter Gaia
U||Another name to grace him. God be with you.
U||I bear you company no more. Behold
U||The dawn with white ray glimm’ring through the mist.
U||I must away—the angel comes—ere he
U||Appear.” He said, and would not hear me more.
U||CANTO XVII
U||Call to remembrance, reader, if thou e’er
U||Hast, on a mountain top, been ta’en by cloud,
U||Through which thou saw’st no better, than the mole
U||Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene’er
U||The wat’ry vapours dense began to melt
U||Into thin air, how faintly the sun’s sphere
U||Seem’d wading through them; so thy nimble thought
U||May image, how at first I re-beheld
U||The sun, that bedward now his couch o’erhung.
U||Thus with my leader’s feet still equaling pace
U||From forth that cloud I came, when now expir’d
U||The parting beams from off the nether shores.
U||O quick and forgetive power! that sometimes dost
U||So rob us of ourselves, we take no mark
U||Though round about us thousand trumpets clang!
U||What moves thee, if the senses stir not? Light
U||Kindled in heav’n, spontaneous, self-inform’d,
U||Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse
U||By will divine. Portray’d before me came
U||The traces of her dire impiety,
U||Whose form was chang’d into the bird, that most
U||Delights itself in song: and here my mind
U||Was inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place
U||To aught that ask’d admittance from without.
U||Next shower’d into my fantasy a shape
U||As of one crucified, whose visage spake
U||Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;
U||And round him Ahasuerus the great king,
U||Esther his bride, and Mordecai the just,
U||Blameless in word and deed. As of itself
U||That unsubstantial coinage of the brain
U||Burst, like a bubble, Which the water fails
U||That fed it; in my vision straight uprose
U||A damsel weeping loud, and cried, “O queen!
U||O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire
U||Driv’n thee to loath thy being? Not to lose
U||Lavinia, desp’rate thou hast slain thyself.
U||Now hast thou lost me. I am she, whose tears
U||Mourn, ere I fall, a mother’s timeless end.”
U||E’en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly
U||New radiance strike upon the closed lids,
U||The broken slumber quivering ere it dies;
U||Thus from before me sunk that imagery
U||Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck
U||The light, outshining far our earthly beam.
U||As round I turn’d me to survey what place
U||I had arriv’d at, “Here ye mount,” exclaim’d
U||A voice, that other purpose left me none,
U||Save will so eager to behold who spake,
U||I could not choose but gaze. As ’fore the sun,
U||That weighs our vision down, and veils his form
U||In light transcendent, thus my virtue fail’d
U||Unequal. “This is Spirit from above,
U||Who marshals us our upward way, unsought;
U||And in his own light shrouds him. As a man
U||Doth for himself, so now is done for us.
U||For whoso waits imploring, yet sees need
U||Of his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar’d
U||For blunt denial, ere the suit be made.
U||Refuse we not to lend a ready foot
U||At such inviting: haste we to ascend,
U||Before it darken: for we may not then,
U||Till morn again return.” So spake my guide;
U||And to one ladder both address’d our steps;
U||And the first stair approaching, I perceiv’d
U||Near me as ’twere the waving of a wing,
U||That fann’d my face and whisper’d: “Blessed they
U||The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.”
U||Now to such height above our heads were rais’d
U||The last beams, follow’d close by hooded night,
U||That many a star on all sides through the gloom
U||Shone out. “Why partest from me, O my strength?”
U||So with myself I commun’d; for I felt
U||My o’ertoil’d sinews slacken. We had reach’d
U||The summit, and were fix’d like to a bark
U||Arriv’d at land. And waiting a short space,
U||If aught should meet mine ear in that new round,
U||Then to my guide I turn’d, and said: “Lov’d sire!
U||Declare what guilt is on this circle purg’d.
U||If our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause.”
U||He thus to me: “The love of good, whate’er
U||Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils.
U||Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter’d ill.
U||But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,
U||Give ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull
U||Some fruit may please thee well, from this delay.
U||“Creator, nor created being, ne’er,
U||My son,” he thus began, “was without love,
U||Or natural, or the free spirit’s growth.
U||Thou hast not that to learn. The natural still
U||Is without error; but the other swerves,
U||If on ill object bent, or through excess
U||Of vigour, or defect. While e’er it seeks
U||The primal blessings, or with measure due
U||Th’ inferior, no delight, that flows from it,
U||Partakes of ill. But let it warp to evil,
U||Or with more ardour than behooves, or less.
U||Pursue the good, the thing created then
U||Works ’gainst its Maker. Hence thou must infer
U||That love is germin of each virtue in ye,
U||And of each act no less, that merits pain.
U||Now since it may not be, but love intend
U||The welfare mainly of the thing it loves,
U||All from self-hatred are secure; and since
U||No being can be thought t’ exist apart
U||And independent of the first, a bar
U||Of equal force restrains from hating that.
U||“Grant the distinction just; and it remains
U||The’ evil must be another’s, which is lov’d.
U||Three ways such love is gender’d in your clay.
U||There is who hopes (his neighbour’s worth deprest,)
U||Preeminence himself, and coverts hence
U||For his own greatness that another fall.
U||There is who so much fears the loss of power,
U||Fame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount
U||Above him), and so sickens at the thought,
U||He loves their opposite: and there is he,
U||Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame
U||That he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs
U||Must doat on other’s evil. Here beneath
U||This threefold love is mourn’d. Of th’ other sort
U||Be now instructed, that which follows good
U||But with disorder’d and irregular course.
U||“All indistinctly apprehend a bliss
U||On which the soul may rest, the hearts of all
U||Yearn after it, and to that wished bourn
U||All therefore strive to tend. If ye behold
U||Or seek it with a love remiss and lax,
U||This cornice after just repenting lays
U||Its penal torment on ye. Other good
U||There is, where man finds not his happiness:
U||It is not true fruition, not that blest
U||Essence, of every good the branch and root.
U||The love too lavishly bestow’d on this,
U||Along three circles over us, is mourn’d.
U||Account of that division tripartite
U||Expect not, fitter for thine own research.”
U||CANTO XVIII
U||The teacher ended, and his high discourse
U||Concluding, earnest in my looks inquir’d
U||If I appear’d content; and I, whom still
U||Unsated thirst to hear him urg’d, was mute,
U||Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:
U||“Perchance my too much questioning offends.”
U||But he, true father, mark’d the secret wish
U||By diffidence restrain’d, and speaking, gave
U||Me boldness thus to speak: “Master, my Sight
U||Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,
U||That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.
U||Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart
U||Holds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t’ unfold
U||That love, from which as from their source thou bring’st
U||All good deeds and their opposite.” He then:
U||“To what I now disclose be thy clear ken
U||Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold
U||How much those blind have err’d, who make themselves
U||The guides of men. The soul, created apt
U||To love, moves versatile which way soe’er
U||Aught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak’d
U||By pleasure into act. Of substance true
U||Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,
U||And in you the ideal shape presenting
U||Attracts the soul’s regard. If she, thus drawn,
U||incline toward it, love is that inclining,
U||And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.
U||Then as the fire points up, and mounting seeks
U||His birth-place and his lasting seat, e’en thus
U||Enters the captive soul into desire,
U||Which is a spiritual motion, that ne’er rests
U||Before enjoyment of the thing it loves.
U||Enough to show thee, how the truth from those
U||Is hidden, who aver all love a thing
U||Praise-worthy in itself: although perhaps
U||Its substance seem still good. Yet if the wax
U||Be good, it follows not th’ impression must.”
U||“What love is,” I return’d, “thy words, O guide!
U||And my own docile mind, reveal. Yet thence
U||New doubts have sprung. For from without if love
U||Be offer’d to us, and the spirit knows
U||No other footing, tend she right or wrong,
U||Is no desert of hers.” He answering thus:
U||“What reason here discovers I have power
U||To show thee: that which lies beyond, expect
U||From Beatrice, faith not reason’s task.
U||Spirit, substantial form, with matter join’d
U||Not in confusion mix’d, hath in itself
U||Specific virtue of that union born,
U||Which is not felt except it work, nor prov’d
U||But through effect, as vegetable life
U||By the green leaf. From whence his intellect
U||Deduced its primal notices of things,
U||Man therefore knows not, or his appetites
U||Their first affections; such in you, as zeal
U||In bees to gather honey; at the first,
U||Volition, meriting nor blame nor praise.
U||But o’er each lower faculty supreme,
U||That as she list are summon’d to her bar,
U||Ye have that virtue in you, whose just voice
U||Uttereth counsel, and whose word should keep
U||The threshold of assent. Here is the source,
U||Whence cause of merit in you is deriv’d,
U||E’en as the affections good or ill she takes,
U||Or severs, winnow’d as the chaff. Those men
U||Who reas’ning went to depth profoundest, mark’d
U||That innate freedom, and were thence induc’d
U||To leave their moral teaching to the world.
U||Grant then, that from necessity arise
U||All love that glows within you; to dismiss
U||Or harbour it, the pow’r is in yourselves.
U||Remember, Beatrice, in her style,
U||Denominates free choice by eminence
U||The noble virtue, if in talk with thee
U||She touch upon that theme.” The moon, well nigh
U||To midnight hour belated, made the stars
U||Appear to wink and fade; and her broad disk
U||Seem’d like a crag on fire, as up the vault
U||That course she journey’d, which the sun then warms,
U||When they of Rome behold him at his set.
U||Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.
U||And now the weight, that hung upon my thought,
U||Was lighten’d by the aid of that clear spirit,
U||Who raiseth Andes above Mantua’s name.
U||I therefore, when my questions had obtain’d
U||Solution plain and ample, stood as one
U||Musing in dreary slumber; but not long
U||Slumber’d; for suddenly a multitude,
U||The steep already turning, from behind,
U||Rush’d on. With fury and like random rout,
U||As echoing on their shores at midnight heard
U||Ismenus and Asopus, for his Thebes
U||If Bacchus’ help were needed; so came these
U||Tumultuous, curving each his rapid step,
U||By eagerness impell’d of holy love.
U||Soon they o’ertook us; with such swiftness mov’d
U||The mighty crowd. Two spirits at their head
U||Cried weeping; “Blessed Mary sought with haste
U||The hilly region. Caesar to subdue
U||Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,
U||And flew to Spain.”—“Oh tarry not: away;”
U||The others shouted; “let not time be lost
U||Through slackness of affection. Hearty zeal
U||To serve reanimates celestial grace.”
U||“O ye, in whom intenser fervency
U||Haply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail’d,
U||Slow or neglectful, to absolve your part
U||Of good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives,
U||(Credit my tale, though strange) desires t’ ascend,
U||So morning rise to light us. Therefore say
U||Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?”
U||So spake my guide, to whom a shade return’d:
U||“Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft.
U||We may not linger: such resistless will
U||Speeds our unwearied course. Vouchsafe us then
U||Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee
U||Discourteous rudeness. In Verona I
U||Was abbot of San Zeno, when the hand
U||Of Barbarossa grasp’d Imperial sway,
U||That name, ne’er utter’d without tears in Milan.
U||And there is he, hath one foot in his grave,
U||Who for that monastery ere long shall weep,
U||Ruing his power misus’d: for that his son,
U||Of body ill compact, and worse in mind,
U||And born in evil, he hath set in place
U||Of its true pastor.” Whether more he spake,
U||Or here was mute, I know not: he had sped
U||E’en now so far beyond us. Yet thus much
U||I heard, and in rememb’rance treasur’d it.
U||He then, who never fail’d me at my need,
U||Cried, “Hither turn. Lo! two with sharp remorse
U||Chiding their sin!” In rear of all the troop
U||These shouted: “First they died, to whom the sea
U||Open’d, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:
U||And they, who with Aeneas to the end
U||Endur’d not suffering, for their portion chose
U||Life without glory.” Soon as they had fled
U||Past reach of sight, new thought within me rose
U||By others follow’d fast, and each unlike
U||Its fellow: till led on from thought to thought,
U||And pleasur’d with the fleeting train, mine eye
U||Was clos’d, and meditation chang’d to dream.
U||CANTO XIX
U||It was the hour, when of diurnal heat
U||No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,
U||O’erpower’d by earth, or planetary sway
U||Of Saturn; and the geomancer sees
U||His Greater Fortune up the east ascend,
U||Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;
U||When ’fore me in my dream a woman’s shape
U||There came, with lips that stammer’d, eyes aslant,
U||Distorted feet, hands maim’d, and colour pale.
U||I look’d upon her; and as sunshine cheers
U||Limbs numb’d by nightly cold, e’en thus my look
U||Unloos’d her tongue, next in brief space her form
U||Decrepit rais’d erect, and faded face
U||With love’s own hue illum’d. Recov’ring speech
U||She forthwith warbling such a strain began,
U||That I, how loth soe’er, could scarce have held
U||Attention from the song. “I,” thus she sang,
U||“I am the Siren, she, whom mariners
U||On the wide sea are wilder’d when they hear:
U||Such fulness of delight the list’ner feels.
U||I from his course Ulysses by my lay
U||Enchanted drew. Whoe’er frequents me once
U||Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart
U||Contented knows no void.” Or ere her mouth
U||Was clos’d, to shame her at her side appear’d
U||A dame of semblance holy. With stern voice
U||She utter’d; “Say, O Virgil, who is this?”
U||Which hearing, he approach’d, with eyes still bent
U||Toward that goodly presence: th’ other seiz’d her,
U||And, her robes tearing, open’d her before,
U||And show’d the belly to me, whence a smell,
U||Exhaling loathsome, wak’d me. Round I turn’d
U||Mine eyes, and thus the teacher: “At the least
U||Three times my voice hath call’d thee. Rise, begone.
U||Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass.”
U||I straightway rose. Now day, pour’d down from high,
U||Fill’d all the circuits of the sacred mount;
U||And, as we journey’d, on our shoulder smote
U||The early ray. I follow’d, stooping low
U||My forehead, as a man, o’ercharg’d with thought,
U||Who bends him to the likeness of an arch,
U||That midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,
U||“Come, enter here,” in tone so soft and mild,
U||As never met the ear on mortal strand.
U||With swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,
U||Who thus had spoken marshal’d us along,
U||Where each side of the solid masonry
U||The sloping, walls retir’d; then mov’d his plumes,
U||And fanning us, affirm’d that those, who mourn,
U||Are blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs.
U||“What aileth thee, that still thou look’st to earth?”
U||Began my leader; while th’ angelic shape
U||A little over us his station took.
U||“New vision,” I replied, “hath rais’d in me
U||Surmizings strange and anxious doubts, whereon
U||My soul intent allows no other thought
U||Or room or entrance.”—“Hast thou seen,” said he,
U||“That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone
U||The spirits o’er us weep for? Hast thou seen
U||How man may free him of her bonds? Enough.
U||Let thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais’d ken
U||Fix on the lure, which heav’n’s eternal King
U||Whirls in the rolling spheres.” As on his feet
U||The falcon first looks down, then to the sky
U||Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,
U||That woos him thither; so the call I heard,
U||So onward, far as the dividing rock
U||Gave way, I journey’d, till the plain was reach’d.
U||On the fifth circle when I stood at large,
U||A race appear’d before me, on the ground
U||All downward lying prone and weeping sore.
U||“My soul hath cleaved to the dust,” I heard
U||With sighs so deep, they well nigh choak’d the words.
U||“O ye elect of God, whose penal woes
U||Both hope and justice mitigate, direct
U||Tow’rds the steep rising our uncertain way.”
U||“If ye approach secure from this our doom,
U||Prostration—and would urge your course with speed,
U||See that ye still to rightward keep the brink.”
U||So them the bard besought; and such the words,
U||Beyond us some short space, in answer came.
U||I noted what remain’d yet hidden from them:
U||Thence to my liege’s eyes mine eyes I bent,
U||And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,
U||Beckon’d his glad assent. Free then to act,
U||As pleas’d me, I drew near, and took my stand
U||O`er that shade, whose words I late had mark’d.
U||And, “Spirit!” I said, “in whom repentant tears
U||Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God
U||Shalt find acceptance, for a while suspend
U||For me that mightier care. Say who thou wast,
U||Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,
U||And if in aught ye wish my service there,
U||Whence living I am come.” He answering spake
U||“The cause why Heav’n our back toward his cope
U||Reverses, shalt thou know: but me know first
U||The successor of Peter, and the name
U||And title of my lineage from that stream,
U||That’ twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws
U||His limpid waters through the lowly glen.
U||A month and little more by proof I learnt,
U||With what a weight that robe of sov’reignty
U||Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire
U||Would guard it: that each other fardel seems
U||But feathers in the balance. Late, alas!
U||Was my conversion: but when I became
U||Rome’s pastor, I discern’d at once the dream
U||And cozenage of life, saw that the heart
U||Rested not there, and yet no prouder height
U||Lur’d on the climber: wherefore, of that life
U||No more enamour’d, in my bosom love
U||Of purer being kindled. For till then
U||I was a soul in misery, alienate
U||From God, and covetous of all earthly things;
U||Now, as thou seest, here punish’d for my doting.
U||Such cleansing from the taint of avarice
U||Do spirits converted need. This mount inflicts
U||No direr penalty. E’en as our eyes
U||Fasten’d below, nor e’er to loftier clime
U||Were lifted, thus hath justice level’d us
U||Here on the earth. As avarice quench’d our love
U||Of good, without which is no working, thus
U||Here justice holds us prison’d, hand and foot
U||Chain’d down and bound, while heaven’s just Lord shall please.
U||So long to tarry motionless outstretch’d.”
U||My knees I stoop’d, and would have spoke; but he,
U||Ere my beginning, by his ear perceiv’d
U||I did him reverence; and “What cause,” said he,
U||“Hath bow’d thee thus!”—“Compunction,” I rejoin’d.
U||“And inward awe of your high dignity.”
U||“Up,” he exclaim’d, “brother! upon thy feet
U||Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I,
U||(Thine and all others’) of one Sovran Power.
U||If thou hast ever mark’d those holy sounds
U||Of gospel truth, ‘nor shall be given ill marriage,’
U||Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.
U||Go thy ways now; and linger here no more.
U||Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears,
U||With which I hasten that whereof thou spak’st.
U||I have on earth a kinswoman; her name
U||Alagia, worthy in herself, so ill
U||Example of our house corrupt her not:
U||And she is all remaineth of me there.”
U||CANTO XX
U||Ill strives the will, ’gainst will more wise that strives
U||His pleasure therefore to mine own preferr’d,
U||I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave.
U||Onward I mov’d: he also onward mov’d,
U||Who led me, coasting still, wherever place
U||Along the rock was vacant, as a man
U||Walks near the battlements on narrow wall.
U||For those on th’ other part, who drop by drop
U||Wring out their all-infecting malady,
U||Too closely press the verge. Accurst be thou!
U||Inveterate wolf! whose gorge ingluts more prey,
U||Than every beast beside, yet is not fill’d!
U||So bottomless thy maw!—Ye spheres of heaven!
U||To whom there are, as seems, who attribute
U||All change in mortal state, when is the day
U||Of his appearing, for whom fate reserves
U||To chase her hence? —With wary steps and slow
U||We pass’d; and I attentive to the shades,
U||Whom piteously I heard lament and wail;
U||And, ’midst the wailing, one before us heard
U||Cry out “O blessed Virgin!” as a dame
U||In the sharp pangs of childbed; and “How poor
U||Thou wast,” it added, “witness that low roof
U||Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.
U||O good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose
U||With poverty, before great wealth with vice.”
U||The words so pleas’d me, that desire to know
U||The spirit, from whose lip they seem’d to come,
U||Did draw me onward. Yet it spake the gift
U||Of Nicholas, which on the maidens he
U||Bounteous bestow’d, to save their youthful prime
U||Unblemish’d. “Spirit! who dost speak of deeds
U||So worthy, tell me who thou was,” I said,
U||“And why thou dost with single voice renew
U||Memorial of such praise. That boon vouchsaf’d
U||Haply shall meet reward; if I return
U||To finish the Short pilgrimage of life,
U||Still speeding to its close on restless wing.”
U||“I,” answer’d he, “will tell thee, not for hell,
U||Which thence I look for; but that in thyself
U||Grace so exceeding shines, before thy time
U||Of mortal dissolution. I was root
U||Of that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds
U||O’er all the Christian land, that seldom thence
U||Good fruit is gather’d. Vengeance soon should come,
U||Had Ghent and Douay, Lille and Bruges power;
U||And vengeance I of heav’n’s great Judge implore.
U||Hugh Capet was I high: from me descend
U||The Philips and the Louis, of whom France
U||Newly is govern’d; born of one, who ply’d
U||The slaughterer’s trade at Paris. When the race
U||Of ancient kings had vanish’d (all save one
U||Wrapt up in sable weeds) within my gripe
U||I found the reins of empire, and such powers
U||Of new acquirement, with full store of friends,
U||That soon the widow’d circlet of the crown
U||Was girt upon the temples of my son,
U||He, from whose bones th’ anointed race begins.
U||Till the great dower of Provence had remov’d
U||The stains, that yet obscur’d our lowly blood,
U||Its sway indeed was narrow, but howe’er
U||It wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,
U||Began its rapine; after, for amends,
U||Poitou it seiz’d, Navarre and Gascony.
U||To Italy came Charles, and for amends
U||Young Conradine an innocent victim slew,
U||And sent th’ angelic teacher back to heav’n,
U||Still for amends. I see the time at hand,
U||That forth from France invites another Charles
U||To make himself and kindred better known.
U||Unarm’d he issues, saving with that lance,
U||Which the arch-traitor tilted with; and that
U||He carries with so home a thrust, as rives
U||The bowels of poor Florence. No increase
U||Of territory hence, but sin and shame
U||Shall be his guerdon, and so much the more
U||As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong.
U||I see the other, who a prisoner late
U||Had steps on shore, exposing to the mart
U||His daughter, whom he bargains for, as do
U||The Corsairs for their slaves. O avarice!
U||What canst thou more, who hast subdued our blood
U||So wholly to thyself, they feel no care
U||Of their own flesh? To hide with direr guilt
U||Past ill and future, lo! the flower-de-luce
U||Enters Alagna! in his Vicar Christ
U||Himself a captive, and his mockery
U||Acted again! Lo! lo his holy lip
U||The vinegar and gall once more applied!
U||And he ’twixt living robbers doom’d to bleed!
U||Lo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty
U||Such violence cannot fill the measure up,
U||With no degree to sanction, pushes on
U||Into the temple his yet eager sails!
U||“O sovran Master! when shall I rejoice
U||To see the vengeance, which thy wrath well-pleas’d
U||In secret silence broods?—While daylight lasts,
U||So long what thou didst hear of her, sole spouse
U||Of the Great Spirit, and on which thou turn’dst
U||To me for comment, is the general theme
U||Of all our prayers: but when it darkens, then
U||A different strain we utter, then record
U||Pygmalion, whom his gluttonous thirst of gold
U||Made traitor, robber, parricide: the woes
U||Of Midas, which his greedy wish ensued,
U||Mark’d for derision to all future times:
U||And the fond Achan, how he stole the prey,
U||That yet he seems by Joshua’s ire pursued.
U||Sapphira with her husband next, we blame;
U||And praise the forefeet, that with furious ramp
U||Spurn’d Heliodorus. All the mountain round
U||Rings with the infamy of Thracia’s king,
U||Who slew his Phrygian charge: and last a shout
U||Ascends: “Declare, O Crassus! for thou know’st,
U||The flavour of thy gold.” The voice of each
U||Now high now low, as each his impulse prompts,
U||Is led through many a pitch, acute or grave.
U||Therefore, not singly, I erewhile rehears’d
U||That blessedness we tell of in the day:
U||But near me none beside his accent rais’d.”
U||From him we now had parted, and essay’d
U||With utmost efforts to surmount the way,
U||When I did feel, as nodding to its fall,
U||The mountain tremble; whence an icy chill
U||Seiz’d on me, as on one to death convey’d.
U||So shook not Delos, when Latona there
U||Couch’d to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.
U||Forthwith from every side a shout arose
U||So vehement, that suddenly my guide
U||Drew near, and cried: “Doubt not, while I conduct thee.”
U||“Glory!” all shouted (such the sounds mine ear
U||Gather’d from those, who near me swell’d the sounds)
U||“Glory in the highest be to God.” We stood
U||Immovably suspended, like to those,
U||The shepherds, who first heard in Bethlehem’s field
U||That song: till ceas’d the trembling, and the song
U||Was ended: then our hallow’d path resum’d,
U||Eying the prostrate shadows, who renew’d
U||Their custom’d mourning. Never in my breast
U||Did ignorance so struggle with desire
U||Of knowledge, if my memory do not err,
U||As in that moment; nor through haste dar’d I
U||To question, nor myself could aught discern,
U||So on I far’d in thoughtfulness and dread.
U||CANTO XXI
U||The natural thirst, ne’er quench’d but from the well,
U||Whereof the woman of Samaria crav’d,
U||Excited: haste along the cumber’d path,
U||After my guide, impell’d; and pity mov’d
U||My bosom for the ’vengeful deed, though just.
U||When lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ
U||Appear’d unto the two upon their way,
U||New-risen from his vaulted grave; to us
U||A shade appear’d, and after us approach’d,
U||Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet.
U||We were not ware of it; so first it spake,
U||Saying, “God give you peace, my brethren!” then
U||Sudden we turn’d: and Virgil such salute,
U||As fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:
U||“Peace in the blessed council be thy lot
U||Awarded by that righteous court, which me
U||To everlasting banishment exiles!”
U||“How!” he exclaim’d, nor from his speed meanwhile
U||Desisting, “If that ye be spirits, whom God
U||Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height
U||Has been thus far your guide?” To whom the bard:
U||“If thou observe the tokens, which this man
U||Trac’d by the finger of the angel bears,
U||’Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just
U||He needs must share. But sithence she, whose wheel
U||Spins day and night, for him not yet had drawn
U||That yarn, which, on the fatal distaff pil’d,
U||Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes,
U||His soul, that sister is to mine and thine,
U||Not of herself could mount, for not like ours
U||Her ken: whence I, from forth the ample gulf
U||Of hell was ta’en, to lead him, and will lead
U||Far as my lore avails. But, if thou know,
U||Instruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile
U||Thus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once
U||Seem’d shouting, even from his wave-wash’d foot.”
U||That questioning so tallied with my wish,
U||The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
U||E’en from expectance. He forthwith replied,
U||“In its devotion nought irregular
U||This mount can witness, or by punctual rule
U||Unsanction’d; here from every change exempt.
U||Other than that, which heaven in itself
U||Doth of itself receive, no influence
U||Can reach us. Tempest none, shower, hail or snow,
U||Hoar frost or dewy moistness, higher falls
U||Than that brief scale of threefold steps: thick clouds
U||Nor scudding rack are ever seen: swift glance
U||Ne’er lightens, nor Thaumantian Iris gleams,
U||That yonder often shift on each side heav’n.
U||Vapour adust doth never mount above
U||The highest of the trinal stairs, whereon
U||Peter’s vicegerent stands. Lower perchance,
U||With various motion rock’d, trembles the soil:
U||But here, through wind in earth’s deep hollow pent,
U||I know not how, yet never trembled: then
U||Trembles, when any spirit feels itself
U||So purified, that it may rise, or move
U||For rising, and such loud acclaim ensues.
U||Purification by the will alone
U||Is prov’d, that free to change society
U||Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will.
U||Desire of bliss is present from the first;
U||But strong propension hinders, to that wish
U||By the just ordinance of heav’n oppos’d;
U||Propension now as eager to fulfil
U||Th’ allotted torment, as erewhile to sin.
U||And I who in this punishment had lain
U||Five hundred years and more, but now have felt
U||Free wish for happier clime. Therefore thou felt’st
U||The mountain tremble, and the spirits devout
U||Heard’st, over all his limits, utter praise
U||To that liege Lord, whom I entreat their joy
U||To hasten.” Thus he spake: and since the draught
U||Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen,
U||No words may speak my fullness of content.
U||“Now,” said the instructor sage, “I see the net
U||That takes ye here, and how the toils are loos’d,
U||Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice.
U||Vouchsafe, that from thy lips I next may learn,
U||Who on the earth thou wast, and wherefore here
U||So many an age wert prostrate.”—“In that time,
U||When the good Titus, with Heav’n’s King to help,
U||Aveng’d those piteous gashes, whence the blood
U||By Judas sold did issue, with the name
U||Most lasting and most honour’d there was I
U||Abundantly renown’d,” the shade reply’d,
U||“Not yet with faith endued. So passing sweet
U||My vocal Spirit, from Tolosa, Rome
U||To herself drew me, where I merited
U||A myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow.
U||Statius they name me still. Of Thebes I sang,
U||And next of great Achilles: but i’ th’ way
U||Fell with the second burthen. Of my flame
U||Those sparkles were the seeds, which I deriv’d
U||From the bright fountain of celestial fire
U||That feeds unnumber’d lamps, the song I mean
U||Which sounds Aeneas’ wand’rings: that the breast
U||I hung at, that the nurse, from whom my veins
U||Drank inspiration: whose authority
U||Was ever sacred with me. To have liv’d
U||Coeval with the Mantuan, I would bide
U||The revolution of another sun
U||Beyond my stated years in banishment.”
U||The Mantuan, when he heard him, turn’d to me,
U||And holding silence: by his countenance
U||Enjoin’d me silence but the power which wills,
U||Bears not supreme control: laughter and tears
U||Follow so closely on the passion prompts them,
U||They wait not for the motions of the will
U||In natures most sincere. I did but smile,
U||As one who winks; and thereupon the shade
U||Broke off, and peer’d into mine eyes, where best
U||Our looks interpret. “So to good event
U||Mayst thou conduct such great emprize,” he cried,
U||“Say, why across thy visage beam’d, but now,
U||The lightning of a smile!” On either part
U||Now am I straiten’d; one conjures me speak,
U||Th’ other to silence binds me: whence a sigh
U||I utter, and the sigh is heard. “Speak on;”
U||The teacher cried; “and do not fear to speak,
U||But tell him what so earnestly he asks.”
U||Whereon I thus: “Perchance, O ancient spirit!
U||Thou marvel’st at my smiling. There is room
U||For yet more wonder. He who guides my ken
U||On high, he is that Mantuan, led by whom
U||Thou didst presume of men and gods to sing.
U||If other cause thou deem’dst for which I smil’d,
U||Leave it as not the true one; and believe
U||Those words, thou spak’st of him, indeed the cause.”
U||Now down he bent t’ embrace my teacher’s feet;
U||But he forbade him: “Brother! do it not:
U||Thou art a shadow, and behold’st a shade.”
U||He rising answer’d thus: “Now hast thou prov’d
U||The force and ardour of the love I bear thee,
U||When I forget we are but things of air,
U||And as a substance treat an empty shade.”
U||CANTO XXII
U||Now we had left the angel, who had turn’d
U||To the sixth circle our ascending step,
U||One gash from off my forehead raz’d: while they,
U||Whose wishes tend to justice, shouted forth:
U||“Blessed!” and ended with, “I thirst:” and I,
U||More nimble than along the other straits,
U||So journey’d, that, without the sense of toil,
U||I follow’d upward the swift-footed shades;
U||When Virgil thus began: “Let its pure flame
U||From virtue flow, and love can never fail
U||To warm another’s bosom’ so the light
U||Shine manifestly forth. Hence from that hour,
U||When ’mongst us in the purlieus of the deep,
U||Came down the spirit of Aquinum’s hard,
U||Who told of thine affection, my good will
U||Hath been for thee of quality as strong
U||As ever link’d itself to one not seen.
U||Therefore these stairs will now seem short to me.
U||But tell me: and if too secure I loose
U||The rein with a friend’s license, as a friend
U||Forgive me, and speak now as with a friend:
U||How chanc’d it covetous desire could find
U||Place in that bosom, ’midst such ample store
U||Of wisdom, as thy zeal had treasur’d there?”
U||First somewhat mov’d to laughter by his words,
U||Statius replied: “Each syllable of thine
U||Is a dear pledge of love. Things oft appear
U||That minister false matters to our doubts,
U||When their true causes are remov’d from sight.
U||Thy question doth assure me, thou believ’st
U||I was on earth a covetous man, perhaps
U||Because thou found’st me in that circle plac’d.
U||Know then I was too wide of avarice:
U||And e’en for that excess, thousands of moons
U||Have wax’d and wan’d upon my sufferings.
U||And were it not that I with heedful care
U||Noted where thou exclaim’st as if in ire
U||With human nature, ‘Why, thou cursed thirst
U||Of gold! dost not with juster measure guide
U||The appetite of mortals?’ I had met
U||The fierce encounter of the voluble rock.
U||Then was I ware that with too ample wing
U||The hands may haste to lavishment, and turn’d,
U||As from my other evil, so from this
U||In penitence. How many from their grave
U||Shall with shorn locks arise, who living, aye
U||And at life’s last extreme, of this offence,
U||Through ignorance, did not repent. And know,
U||The fault which lies direct from any sin
U||In level opposition, here With that
U||Wastes its green rankness on one common heap.
U||Therefore if I have been with those, who wail
U||Their avarice, to cleanse me, through reverse
U||Of their transgression, such hath been my lot.”
U||To whom the sovran of the pastoral song:
U||“While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wag’d
U||By the twin sorrow of Jocasta’s womb,
U||From thy discourse with Clio there, it seems
U||As faith had not been shine: without the which
U||Good deeds suffice not. And if so, what sun
U||Rose on thee, or what candle pierc’d the dark
U||That thou didst after see to hoist the sail,
U||And follow, where the fisherman had led?”
U||He answering thus: “By thee conducted first,
U||I enter’d the Parnassian grots, and quaff’d
U||Of the clear spring; illumin’d first by thee
U||Open’d mine eyes to God. Thou didst, as one,
U||Who, journeying through the darkness, hears a light
U||Behind, that profits not himself, but makes
U||His followers wise, when thou exclaimedst, ‘Lo!
U||A renovated world! Justice return’d!
U||Times of primeval innocence restor’d!
U||And a new race descended from above!’
U||Poet and Christian both to thee I owed.
U||That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace,
U||My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines
U||With livelier colouring. Soon o’er all the world,
U||By messengers from heav’n, the true belief
U||Teem’d now prolific, and that word of thine
U||Accordant, to the new instructors chim’d.
U||Induc’d by which agreement, I was wont
U||Resort to them; and soon their sanctity
U||So won upon me, that, Domitian’s rage
U||Pursuing them, I mix’d my tears with theirs,
U||And, while on earth I stay’d, still succour’d them;
U||And their most righteous customs made me scorn
U||All sects besides. Before I led the Greeks
U||In tuneful fiction, to the streams of Thebes,
U||I was baptiz’d; but secretly, through fear,
U||Remain’d a Christian, and conform’d long time
U||To Pagan rites. Five centuries and more,
U||T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace
U||Round the fourth circle. Thou then, who hast rais’d
U||The covering, which did hide such blessing from me,
U||Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb,
U||Say, if thou know, where our old Terence bides,
U||Caecilius, Plautus, Varro: if condemn’d
U||They dwell, and in what province of the deep.”
U||“These,” said my guide, “with Persius and myself,
U||And others many more, are with that Greek,
U||Of mortals, the most cherish’d by the Nine,
U||In the first ward of darkness. There ofttimes
U||We of that mount hold converse, on whose top
U||For aye our nurses live. We have the bard
U||Of Pella, and the Teian, Agatho,
U||Simonides, and many a Grecian else
U||Ingarlanded with laurel. Of thy train
U||Antigone is there, Deiphile,
U||Argia, and as sorrowful as erst
U||Ismene, and who show’d Langia’s wave:
U||Deidamia with her sisters there,
U||And blind Tiresias’ daughter, and the bride
U||Sea-born of Peleus.” Either poet now
U||Was silent, and no longer by th’ ascent
U||Or the steep walls obstructed, round them cast
U||Inquiring eyes. Four handmaids of the day
U||Had finish’d now their office, and the fifth
U||Was at the chariot-beam, directing still
U||Its balmy point aloof, when thus my guide:
U||“Methinks, it well behooves us to the brink
U||Bend the right shoulder’ circuiting the mount,
U||As we have ever us’d.” So custom there
U||Was usher to the road, the which we chose
U||Less doubtful, as that worthy shade complied.
U||They on before me went; I sole pursued,
U||List’ning their speech, that to my thoughts convey’d
U||Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy.
U||But soon they ceas’d; for midway of the road
U||A tree we found, with goodly fruitage hung,
U||And pleasant to the smell: and as a fir
U||Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads,
U||So downward this less ample spread, that none.
U||Methinks, aloft may climb. Upon the side,
U||That clos’d our path, a liquid crystal fell
U||From the steep rock, and through the sprays above
U||Stream’d showering. With associate step the bards
U||Drew near the plant; and from amidst the leaves
U||A voice was heard: “Ye shall be chary of me;”
U||And after added: “Mary took more thought
U||For joy and honour of the nuptial feast,
U||Than for herself who answers now for you.
U||The women of old Rome were satisfied
U||With water for their beverage. Daniel fed
U||On pulse, and wisdom gain’d. The primal age
U||Was beautiful as gold; and hunger then
U||Made acorns tasteful, thirst each rivulet
U||Run nectar. Honey and locusts were the food,
U||Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness
U||Fed, and that eminence of glory reach’d
U||And greatness, which the’ Evangelist records.”
U||CANTO XXIII
U||On the green leaf mine eyes were fix’d, like his
U||Who throws away his days in idle chase
U||Of the diminutive, when thus I heard
U||The more than father warn me: “Son! our time
U||Asks thriftier using. Linger not: away.”
U||Thereat my face and steps at once I turn’d
U||Toward the sages, by whose converse cheer’d
U||I journey’d on, and felt no toil: and lo!
U||A sound of weeping and a song: “My lips,
U||O Lord!” and these so mingled, it gave birth
U||To pleasure and to pain. “O Sire, belov’d!
U||Say what is this I hear?” Thus I inquir’d.
U||“Spirits,” said he, “who as they go, perchance,
U||Their debt of duty pay.” As on their road
U||The thoughtful pilgrims, overtaking some
U||Not known unto them, turn to them, and look,
U||But stay not; thus, approaching from behind
U||With speedier motion, eyed us, as they pass’d,
U||A crowd of spirits, silent and devout.
U||The eyes of each were dark and hollow: pale
U||Their visage, and so lean withal, the bones
U||Stood staring thro’ the skin. I do not think
U||Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon show’d,
U||When pinc’ed by sharp-set famine to the quick.
U||“Lo!” to myself I mus’d, “the race, who lost
U||Jerusalem, when Mary with dire beak
U||Prey’d on her child.” The sockets seem’d as rings,
U||From which the gems were drops. Who reads the name
U||Of man upon his forehead, there the M
U||Had trac’d most plainly. Who would deem, that scent
U||Of water and an apple, could have prov’d
U||Powerful to generate such pining want,
U||Not knowing how it wrought? While now I stood
U||Wond’ring what thus could waste them (for the cause
U||Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind
U||Appear’d not) lo! a spirit turn’d his eyes
U||In their deep-sunken cell, and fasten’d then
U||On me, then cried with vehemence aloud:
U||“What grace is this vouchsaf’d me?” By his looks
U||I ne’er had recogniz’d him: but the voice
U||Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal’d.
U||Remembrance of his alter’d lineaments
U||Was kindled from that spark; and I agniz’d
U||The visage of Forese. “Ah! respect
U||This wan and leprous wither’d skin,” thus he
U||Suppliant implor’d, “this macerated flesh.
U||Speak to me truly of thyself. And who
U||Are those twain spirits, that escort thee there?
U||Be it not said thou Scorn’st to talk with me.”
U||“That face of thine,” I answer’d him, “which dead
U||I once bewail’d, disposes me not less
U||For weeping, when I see It thus transform’d.
U||Say then, by Heav’n, what blasts ye thus? The whilst
U||I wonder, ask not Speech from me: unapt
U||Is he to speak, whom other will employs.”
U||He thus: “The water and tee plant we pass’d,
U||Virtue possesses, by th’ eternal will
U||Infus’d, the which so pines me. Every spirit,
U||Whose song bewails his gluttony indulg’d
U||Too grossly, here in hunger and in thirst
U||Is purified. The odour, which the fruit,
U||And spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe,
U||Inflames us with desire to feed and drink.
U||Nor once alone encompassing our route
U||We come to add fresh fuel to the pain:
U||Pain, said I? solace rather: for that will
U||To the tree leads us, by which Christ was led
U||To call Elias, joyful when he paid
U||Our ransom from his vein.” I answering thus:
U||“Forese! from that day, in which the world
U||For better life thou changedst, not five years
U||Have circled. If the power of sinning more
U||Were first concluded in thee, ere thou knew’st
U||That kindly grief, which re-espouses us
U||To God, how hither art thou come so soon?
U||I thought to find thee lower, there, where time
U||Is recompense for time.” He straight replied:
U||“To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction
U||I have been brought thus early by the tears
U||Stream’d down my Nella’s cheeks. Her prayers devout,
U||Her sighs have drawn me from the coast, where oft
U||Expectance lingers, and have set me free
U||From th’ other circles. In the sight of God
U||So much the dearer is my widow priz’d,
U||She whom I lov’d so fondly, as she ranks
U||More singly eminent for virtuous deeds.
U||The tract most barb’rous of Sardinia’s isle,
U||Hath dames more chaste and modester by far
U||Than that wherein I left her. O sweet brother!
U||What wouldst thou have me say? A time to come
U||Stands full within my view, to which this hour
U||Shall not be counted of an ancient date,
U||When from the pulpit shall be loudly warn’d
U||Th’ unblushing dames of Florence, lest they bare
U||Unkerchief’d bosoms to the common gaze.
U||What savage women hath the world e’er seen,
U||What Saracens, for whom there needed scourge
U||Of spiritual or other discipline,
U||To force them walk with cov’ring on their limbs!
U||But did they see, the shameless ones, that Heav’n
U||Wafts on swift wing toward them, while I speak,
U||Their mouths were op’d for howling: they shall taste
U||Of Borrow (unless foresight cheat me here)
U||Or ere the cheek of him be cloth’d with down
U||Who is now rock’d with lullaby asleep.
U||Ah! now, my brother, hide thyself no more,
U||Thou seest how not I alone but all
U||Gaze, where thou veil’st the intercepted sun.”
U||Whence I replied: “If thou recall to mind
U||What we were once together, even yet
U||Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore.
U||That I forsook that life, was due to him
U||Who there precedes me, some few evenings past,
U||When she was round, who shines with sister lamp
U||To his, that glisters yonder,” and I show’d
U||The sun. “Tis he, who through profoundest night
U||Of he true dead has brought me, with this flesh
U||As true, that follows. From that gloom the aid
U||Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb,
U||And climbing wind along this mountain-steep,
U||Which rectifies in you whate’er the world
U||Made crooked and deprav’d I have his word,
U||That he will bear me company as far
U||As till I come where Beatrice dwells:
U||But there must leave me. Virgil is that spirit,
U||Who thus hath promis’d,” and I pointed to him;
U||“The other is that shade, for whom so late
U||Your realm, as he arose, exulting shook
U||Through every pendent cliff and rocky bound.”
U||CANTO XXIV
U||Our journey was not slacken’d by our talk,
U||Nor yet our talk by journeying. Still we spake,
U||And urg’d our travel stoutly, like a ship
U||When the wind sits astern. The shadowy forms,
U||That seem’d things dead and dead again, drew in
U||At their deep-delved orbs rare wonder of me,
U||Perceiving I had life; and I my words
U||Continued, and thus spake; “He journeys up
U||Perhaps more tardily then else he would,
U||For others’ sake. But tell me, if thou know’st,
U||Where is Piccarda? Tell me, if I see
U||Any of mark, among this multitude,
U||Who eye me thus.”—“My sister (she for whom,
U||’Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say
U||Which name was fitter ) wears e’en now her crown,
U||And triumphs in Olympus.” Saying this,
U||He added: “Since spare diet hath so worn
U||Our semblance out, ’t is lawful here to name
U||Each one. This,” and his finger then he rais’d,
U||“Is Buonaggiuna,—Buonaggiuna, he
U||Of Lucca: and that face beyond him, pierc’d
U||Unto a leaner fineness than the rest,
U||Had keeping of the church: he was of Tours,
U||And purges by wan abstinence away
U||Bolsena’s eels and cups of muscadel.”
U||He show’d me many others, one by one,
U||And all, as they were nam’d, seem’d well content;
U||For no dark gesture I discern’d in any.
U||I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind
U||His teeth on emptiness; and Boniface,
U||That wav’d the crozier o’er a num’rous flock.
U||I saw the Marquis, who tad time erewhile
U||To swill at Forli with less drought, yet so
U||Was one ne’er sated. I howe’er, like him,
U||That gazing ’midst a crowd, singles out one,
U||So singled him of Lucca; for methought
U||Was none amongst them took such note of me.
U||Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca:
U||The sound was indistinct, and murmur’d there,
U||Where justice, that so strips them, fix’d her sting.
U||“Spirit!” said I, “it seems as thou wouldst fain
U||Speak with me. Let me hear thee. Mutual wish
U||To converse prompts, which let us both indulge.”
U||He, answ’ring, straight began: “Woman is born,
U||Whose brow no wimple shades yet, that shall make
U||My city please thee, blame it as they may.
U||Go then with this forewarning. If aught false
U||My whisper too implied, th’ event shall tell
U||But say, if of a truth I see the man
U||Of that new lay th’ inventor, which begins
U||With ‘Ladies, ye that con the lore of love’.”
U||To whom I thus: “Count of me but as one
U||Who am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes,
U||Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.”
U||“Brother!” said he, “the hind’rance which once held
U||The notary with Guittone and myself,
U||Short of that new and sweeter style I hear,
U||Is now disclos’d. I see how ye your plumes
U||Stretch, as th’ inditer guides them; which, no question,
U||Ours did not. He that seeks a grace beyond,
U||Sees not the distance parts one style from other.”
U||And, as contented, here he held his peace.
U||Like as the bird, that winter near the Nile,
U||In squared regiment direct their course,
U||Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight;
U||Thus all the tribe of spirits, as they turn’d
U||Their visage, faster deaf, nimble alike
U||Through leanness and desire. And as a man,
U||Tir’d With the motion of a trotting steed,
U||Slacks pace, and stays behind his company,
U||Till his o’erbreathed lungs keep temperate time;
U||E’en so Forese let that holy crew
U||Proceed, behind them lingering at my side,
U||And saying: “When shall I again behold thee?”
U||“How long my life may last,” said I, “I know not;
U||This know, how soon soever I return,
U||My wishes will before me have arriv’d.
U||Sithence the place, where I am set to live,
U||Is, day by day, more scoop’d of all its good,
U||And dismal ruin seems to threaten it.”
U||“Go now,” he cried: “lo! he, whose guilt is most,
U||Passes before my vision, dragg’d at heels
U||Of an infuriate beast. Toward the vale,
U||Where guilt hath no redemption, on it speeds,
U||Each step increasing swiftness on the last;
U||Until a blow it strikes, that leaveth him
U||A corse most vilely shatter’d. No long space
U||Those wheels have yet to roll” (therewith his eyes
U||Look’d up to heav’n) “ere thou shalt plainly see
U||That which my words may not more plainly tell.
U||I quit thee: time is precious here: I lose
U||Too much, thus measuring my pace with shine.”
U||As from a troop of well-rank’d chivalry
U||One knight, more enterprising than the rest,
U||Pricks forth at gallop, eager to display
U||His prowess in the first encounter prov’d
U||So parted he from us with lengthen’d strides,
U||And left me on the way with those twain spirits,
U||Who were such mighty marshals of the world.
U||When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes
U||No nearer reach’d him, than my thought his words,
U||The branches of another fruit, thick hung,
U||And blooming fresh, appear’d. E’en as our steps
U||Turn’d thither, not far off it rose to view.
U||Beneath it were a multitude, that rais’d
U||Their hands, and shouted forth I know not What
U||Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats,
U||That beg, and answer none obtain from him,
U||Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on,
U||He at arm’s length the object of their wish
U||Above them holds aloft, and hides it not.
U||At length, as undeceiv’d they went their way:
U||And we approach the tree, who vows and tears
U||Sue to in vain, the mighty tree. “Pass on,
U||And come not near. Stands higher up the wood,
U||Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta’en
U||‘this plant.” Such sounds from midst the thickets came.
U||Whence I, with either bard, close to the side
U||That rose, pass’d forth beyond. “Remember,” next
U||We heard, “those noblest creatures of the clouds,
U||How they their twofold bosoms overgorg’d
U||Oppos’d in fight to Theseus: call to mind
U||The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop’d
U||To ease their thirst; whence Gideon’s ranks were thinn’d,
U||As he to Midian march’d adown the hills.”
U||Thus near one border coasting, still we heard
U||The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile
U||Reguerdon’d. Then along the lonely path,
U||Once more at large, full thousand paces on
U||We travel’d, each contemplative and mute.
U||“Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?”
U||Thus suddenly a voice exclaim’d: whereat
U||I shook, as doth a scar’d and paltry beast;
U||Then rais’d my head to look from whence it came.
U||Was ne’er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen
U||So bright and glowing red, as was the shape
U||I now beheld. “If ye desire to mount,”
U||He cried, “here must ye turn. This way he goes,
U||Who goes in quest of peace.” His countenance
U||Had dazzled me; and to my guides I fac’d
U||Backward, like one who walks, as sound directs.
U||As when, to harbinger the dawn, springs up
U||On freshen’d wing the air of May, and breathes
U||Of fragrance, all impregn’d with herb and flowers,
U||E’en such a wind I felt upon my front
U||Blow gently, and the moving of a wing
U||Perceiv’d, that moving shed ambrosial smell;
U||And then a voice: “Blessed are they, whom grace
U||Doth so illume, that appetite in them
U||Exhaleth no inordinate desire,
U||Still hung’ring as the rule of temperance wills.”
U||CANTO XXV
U||It was an hour, when he who climbs, had need
U||To walk uncrippled: for the sun had now
U||To Taurus the meridian circle left,
U||And to the Scorpion left the night. As one
U||That makes no pause, but presses on his road,
U||Whate’er betide him, if some urgent need
U||Impel: so enter’d we upon our way,
U||One before other; for, but singly, none
U||That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.
U||E’en as the young stork lifteth up his wing
U||Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit
U||The nest, and drops it; so in me desire
U||Of questioning my guide arose, and fell,
U||Arriving even to the act, that marks
U||A man prepar’d for speech. Him all our haste
U||Restrain’d not, but thus spake the sire belov’d:
U||“Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip
U||Stands trembling for its flight.” Encourag’d thus
U||I straight began: “How there can leanness come,
U||Where is no want of nourishment to feed?”
U||“If thou,” he answer’d, “hadst remember’d thee,
U||How Meleager with the wasting brand
U||Wasted alike, by equal fires consum’d,
U||This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,
U||How in the mirror your reflected form
U||With mimic motion vibrates, what now seems
U||Hard, had appear’d no harder than the pulp
U||Of summer fruit mature. But that thy will
U||In certainty may find its full repose,
U||Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray
U||That he would now be healer of thy wound.”
U||“If in thy presence I unfold to him
U||The secrets of heaven’s vengeance, let me plead
U||Thine own injunction, to exculpate me.”
U||So Statius answer’d, and forthwith began:
U||“Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind
U||Receive them: so shall they be light to clear
U||The doubt thou offer’st. Blood, concocted well,
U||Which by the thirsty veins is ne’er imbib’d,
U||And rests as food superfluous, to be ta’en
U||From the replenish’d table, in the heart
U||Derives effectual virtue, that informs
U||The several human limbs, as being that,
U||Which passes through the veins itself to make them.
U||Yet more concocted it descends, where shame
U||Forbids to mention: and from thence distils
U||In natural vessel on another’s blood.
U||Then each unite together, one dispos’d
U||T’ endure, to act the other, through meet frame
U||Of its recipient mould: that being reach’d,
U||It ’gins to work, coagulating first;
U||Then vivifies what its own substance caus’d
U||To bear. With animation now indued,
U||The active virtue (differing from a plant
U||No further, than that this is on the way
U||And at its limit that) continues yet
U||To operate, that now it moves, and feels,
U||As sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there
U||Assumes th’ organic powers its seed convey’d.
U||‘This is the period, son! at which the virtue,
U||That from the generating heart proceeds,
U||Is pliant and expansive; for each limb
U||Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann’d.
U||How babe of animal becomes, remains
U||For thy consid’ring. At this point, more wise,
U||Than thou hast err’d, making the soul disjoin’d
U||From passive intellect, because he saw
U||No organ for the latter’s use assign’d.
U||“Open thy bosom to the truth that comes.
U||Know soon as in the embryo, to the brain,
U||Articulation is complete, then turns
U||The primal Mover with a smile of joy
U||On such great work of nature, and imbreathes
U||New spirit replete with virtue, that what here
U||Active it finds, to its own substance draws,
U||And forms an individual soul, that lives,
U||And feels, and bends reflective on itself.
U||And that thou less mayst marvel at the word,
U||Mark the sun’s heat, how that to wine doth change,
U||Mix’d with the moisture filter’d through the vine.
U||“When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul
U||Takes with her both the human and divine,
U||Memory, intelligence, and will, in act
U||Far keener than before, the other powers
U||Inactive all and mute. No pause allow’d,
U||In wond’rous sort self-moving, to one strand
U||Of those, where the departed roam, she falls,
U||Here learns her destin’d path. Soon as the place
U||Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,
U||Distinct as in the living limbs before:
U||And as the air, when saturate with showers,
U||The casual beam refracting, decks itself
U||With many a hue; so here the ambient air
U||Weareth that form, which influence of the soul
U||Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where
U||The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth
U||The new form on the spirit follows still:
U||Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call’d,
U||With each sense even to the sight endued:
U||Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs
U||Which thou mayst oft have witness’d on the mount
U||Th’ obedient shadow fails not to present
U||Whatever varying passion moves within us.
U||And this the cause of what thou marvel’st at.”
U||Now the last flexure of our way we reach’d,
U||And to the right hand turning, other care
U||Awaits us. Here the rocky precipice
U||Hurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim
U||A blast upblown, with forcible rebuff
U||Driveth them back, sequester’d from its bound.
U||Behoov’d us, one by one, along the side,
U||That border’d on the void, to pass; and I
U||Fear’d on one hand the fire, on th’ other fear’d
U||Headlong to fall: when thus th’ instructor warn’d:
U||“Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.
U||A little swerving and the way is lost.”
U||Then from the bosom of the burning mass,
U||“O God of mercy!” heard I sung; and felt
U||No less desire to turn. And when I saw
U||Spirits along the flame proceeding, I
U||Between their footsteps and mine own was fain
U||To share by turns my view. At the hymn’s close
U||They shouted loud, “I do not know a man;”
U||Then in low voice again took up the strain,
U||Which once more ended, “To the wood,” they cried,
U||“Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung
U||With Cytherea’s poison:” then return’d
U||Unto their song; then marry a pair extoll’d,
U||Who liv’d in virtue chastely, and the bands
U||Of wedded love. Nor from that task, I ween,
U||Surcease they; whilesoe’er the scorching fire
U||Enclasps them. Of such skill appliance needs
U||To medicine the wound, that healeth last.
U||CANTO XXVI
U||While singly thus along the rim we walk’d,
U||Oft the good master warn’d me: “Look thou well.
U||Avail it that I caution thee.” The sun
U||Now all the western clime irradiate chang’d
U||From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass’d,
U||My passing shadow made the umber’d flame
U||Burn ruddier. At so strange a sight I mark’d
U||That many a spirit marvel’d on his way.
U||This bred occasion first to speak of me,
U||“He seems,” said they, “no insubstantial frame:”
U||Then to obtain what certainty they might,
U||Stretch’d towards me, careful not to overpass
U||The burning pale. “O thou, who followest
U||The others, haply not more slow than they,
U||But mov’d by rev’rence, answer me, who burn
U||In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these
U||All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth
U||Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.
U||Tell us, how is it that thou mak’st thyself
U||A wall against the sun, as thou not yet
U||Into th’ inextricable toils of death
U||Hadst enter’d?” Thus spake one, and I had straight
U||Declar’d me, if attention had not turn’d
U||To new appearance. Meeting these, there came,
U||Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom
U||Earnestly gazing, from each part I view
U||The shadows all press forward, sev’rally
U||Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away.
U||E’en so the emmets, ’mid their dusky troops,
U||Peer closely one at other, to spy out
U||Their mutual road perchance, and how they thrive.
U||That friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch
U||Of the first onward step, from either tribe
U||Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come,
U||Shout “Sodom and Gomorrah!” these, “The cow
U||Pasiphae enter’d, that the beast she woo’d
U||Might rush unto her luxury.” Then as cranes,
U||That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,
U||Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid
U||The ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off
U||One crowd, advances th’ other; and resume
U||Their first song weeping, and their several shout.
U||Again drew near my side the very same,
U||Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks
U||Mark’d eagerness to listen. I, who twice
U||Their will had noted, spake: “O spirits secure,
U||Whene’er the time may be, of peaceful end!
U||My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,
U||Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed
U||With blood, and sinew-strung. That I no more
U||May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft.
U||There is a dame on high, who wind for us
U||This grace, by which my mortal through your realm
U||I bear. But may your utmost wish soon meet
U||Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven,
U||Fullest of love, and of most ample space,
U||Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page
U||Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,
U||And what this multitude, that at your backs
U||Have past behind us.” As one, mountain-bred,
U||Rugged and clownish, if some city’s walls
U||He chance to enter, round him stares agape,
U||Confounded and struck dumb; e’en such appear’d
U||Each spirit. But when rid of that amaze,
U||(Not long the inmate of a noble heart)
U||He, who before had question’d, thus resum’d:
U||“O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak’st
U||Experience of our limits, in thy bark!
U||Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,
U||For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard
U||The snout of ‘queen,’ to taunt him. Hence their cry
U||Of ‘Sodom,’ as they parted, to rebuke
U||Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame.
U||Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,
U||Because the law of human kind we broke,
U||Following like beasts our vile concupiscence,
U||Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace
U||Record the name of her, by whom the beast
U||In bestial tire was acted. Now our deeds
U||Thou know’st, and how we sinn’d. If thou by name
U||Wouldst haply know us, time permits not now
U||To tell so much, nor can I. Of myself
U||Learn what thou wishest. Guinicelli I,
U||Who having truly sorrow’d ere my last,
U||Already cleanse me.” With such pious joy,
U||As the two sons upon their mother gaz’d
U||From sad Lycurgus rescu’d, such my joy
U||(Save that I more represt it) when I heard
U||From his own lips the name of him pronounc’d,
U||Who was a father to me, and to those
U||My betters, who have ever us’d the sweet
U||And pleasant rhymes of love. So nought I heard
U||Nor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,
U||Gazing on him; and, only for the fire,
U||Approach’d not nearer. When my eyes were fed
U||By looking on him, with such solemn pledge,
U||As forces credence, I devoted me
U||Unto his service wholly. In reply
U||He thus bespake me: “What from thee I hear
U||Is grav’d so deeply on my mind, the waves
U||Of Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make
U||A whit less lively. But as now thy oath
U||Has seal’d the truth, declare what cause impels
U||That love, which both thy looks and speech bewray.”
U||“Those dulcet lays,” I answer’d, “which, as long
U||As of our tongue the beauty does not fade,
U||Shall make us love the very ink that trac’d them.”
U||“Brother!” he cried, and pointed at a shade
U||Before him, “there is one, whose mother speech
U||Doth owe to him a fairer ornament.
U||He in love ditties and the tales of prose
U||Without a rival stands, and lets the fools
U||Talk on, who think the songster of Limoges
U||O’ertops him. Rumour and the popular voice
U||They look to more than truth, and so confirm
U||Opinion, ere by art or reason taught.
U||Thus many of the elder time cried up
U||Guittone, giving him the prize, till truth
U||By strength of numbers vanquish’d. If thou own
U||So ample privilege, as to have gain’d
U||Free entrance to the cloister, whereof Christ
U||Is Abbot of the college, say to him
U||One paternoster for me, far as needs
U||For dwellers in this world, where power to sin
U||No longer tempts us.” Haply to make way
U||For one, that follow’d next, when that was said,
U||He vanish’d through the fire, as through the wave
U||A fish, that glances diving to the deep.
U||I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew
U||A little onward, and besought his name,
U||For which my heart, I said, kept gracious room.
U||He frankly thus began: “Thy courtesy
U||So wins on me, I have nor power nor will
U||To hide me. I am Arnault; and with songs,
U||Sorely lamenting for my folly past,
U||Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see
U||The day, I hope for, smiling in my view.
U||I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up
U||Unto the summit of the scale, in time
U||Remember ye my suff’rings.” With such words
U||He disappear’d in the refining flame.
U||CANTO XXVII
U||Now was the sun so station’d, as when first
U||His early radiance quivers on the heights,
U||Where stream’d his Maker’s blood, while Libra hangs
U||Above Hesperian Ebro, and new fires
U||Meridian flash on Ganges’ yellow tide.
U||So day was sinking, when the’ angel of God
U||Appear’d before us. Joy was in his mien.
U||Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink,
U||And with a voice, whose lively clearness far
U||Surpass’d our human, “Blessed are the pure
U||In heart,” he Sang: then near him as we came,
U||“Go ye not further, holy spirits!” he cried,
U||“Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list
U||Attentive to the song ye hear from thence.”
U||I, when I heard his saying, was as one
U||Laid in the grave. My hands together clasp’d,
U||And upward stretching, on the fire I look’d,
U||And busy fancy conjur’d up the forms
U||Erewhile beheld alive consum’d in flames.
U||Th’ escorting spirits turn’d with gentle looks
U||Toward me, and the Mantuan spake: “My son,
U||Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death.
U||Remember thee, remember thee, if I
U||Safe e’en on Geryon brought thee: now I come
U||More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?
U||Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame
U||A thousand years contain’d thee, from thy head
U||No hair should perish. If thou doubt my truth,
U||Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture’s hem
U||Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief.
U||Lay now all fear, O lay all fear aside.
U||Turn hither, and come onward undismay’d.”
U||I still, though conscience urg’d’ no step advanc’d.
U||When still he saw me fix’d and obstinate,
U||Somewhat disturb’d he cried: “Mark now, my son,
U||From Beatrice thou art by this wall
U||Divided.” As at Thisbe’s name the eye
U||Of Pyramus was open’d (when life ebb’d
U||Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance,
U||While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn’d
U||To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard
U||The name, that springs forever in my breast.
U||He shook his forehead; and, “How long,” he said,
U||“Linger we now?” then smil’d, as one would smile
U||Upon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields.
U||Into the fire before me then he walk’d;
U||And Statius, who erewhile no little space
U||Had parted us, he pray’d to come behind.
U||I would have cast me into molten glass
U||To cool me, when I enter’d; so intense
U||Rag’d the conflagrant mass. The sire belov’d,
U||To comfort me, as he proceeded, still
U||Of Beatrice talk’d. “Her eyes,” saith he,
U||“E’en now I seem to view.” From the other side
U||A voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice
U||Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,
U||There where the path led upward. “Come,” we heard,
U||“Come, blessed of my Father.” Such the sounds,
U||That hail’d us from within a light, which shone
U||So radiant, I could not endure the view.
U||“The sun,” it added, “hastes: and evening comes.
U||Delay not: ere the western sky is hung
U||With blackness, strive ye for the pass.” Our way
U||Upright within the rock arose, and fac’d
U||Such part of heav’n, that from before my steps
U||The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.
U||Nor many stairs were overpass, when now
U||By fading of the shadow we perceiv’d
U||The sun behind us couch’d: and ere one face
U||Of darkness o’er its measureless expanse
U||Involv’d th’ horizon, and the night her lot
U||Held individual, each of us had made
U||A stair his pallet: not that will, but power,
U||Had fail’d us, by the nature of that mount
U||Forbidden further travel. As the goats,
U||That late have skipp’d and wanton’d rapidly
U||Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta’en
U||Their supper on the herb, now silent lie
U||And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,
U||While noonday rages; and the goatherd leans
U||Upon his staff, and leaning watches them:
U||And as the swain, that lodges out all night
U||In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey
U||Disperse them; even so all three abode,
U||I as a goat and as the shepherds they,
U||Close pent on either side by shelving rock.
U||A little glimpse of sky was seen above;
U||Yet by that little I beheld the stars
U||In magnitude and rustle shining forth
U||With more than wonted glory. As I lay,
U||Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing,
U||Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft
U||Tidings of future hap. About the hour,
U||As I believe, when Venus from the east
U||First lighten’d on the mountain, she whose orb
U||Seems always glowing with the fire of love,
U||A lady young and beautiful, I dream’d,
U||Was passing o’er a lea; and, as she came,
U||Methought I saw her ever and anon
U||Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:
U||“Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,
U||That I am Leah: for my brow to weave
U||A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply.
U||To please me at the crystal mirror, here
U||I deck me. But my sister Rachel, she
U||Before her glass abides the livelong day,
U||Her radiant eyes beholding, charm’d no less,
U||Than I with this delightful task. Her joy
U||In contemplation, as in labour mine.”
U||And now as glimm’ring dawn appear’d, that breaks
U||More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he
U||Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,
U||Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled
U||My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide
U||Already risen. “That delicious fruit,
U||Which through so many a branch the zealous care
U||Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day
U||Appease thy hunger.” Such the words I heard
U||From Virgil’s lip; and never greeting heard
U||So pleasant as the sounds. Within me straight
U||Desire so grew upon desire to mount,
U||Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings
U||Increasing for my flight. When we had run
U||O’er all the ladder to its topmost round,
U||As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix’d
U||His eyes, and thus he spake: “Both fires, my son,
U||The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,
U||And art arriv’d, where of itself my ken
U||No further reaches. I with skill and art
U||Thus far have drawn thee. Now thy pleasure take
U||For guide. Thou hast o’ercome the steeper way,
U||O’ercome the straighter. Lo! the sun, that darts
U||His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,
U||The arboreta and flowers, which of itself
U||This land pours forth profuse! Till those bright eyes
U||With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste
U||To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,
U||Or wander where thou wilt. Expect no more
U||Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,
U||Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,
U||Discreet, judicious. To distrust thy sense
U||Were henceforth error. I invest thee then
U||With crown and mitre, sovereign o’er thyself.”
U||CANTO XXVIII
U||Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade
U||With lively greenness the new-springing day
U||Attemper’d, eager now to roam, and search
U||Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,
U||Along the champain leisurely my way
U||Pursuing, o’er the ground, that on all sides
U||Delicious odour breath’d. A pleasant air,
U||That intermitted never, never veer’d,
U||Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind
U||Of softest influence: at which the sprays,
U||Obedient all, lean’d trembling to that part
U||Where first the holy mountain casts his shade,
U||Yet were not so disorder’d, but that still
U||Upon their top the feather’d quiristers
U||Applied their wonted art, and with full joy
U||Welcom’d those hours of prime, and warbled shrill
U||Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays
U||inept tenor; even as from branch to branch,
U||Along the piney forests on the shore
U||Of Chiassi, rolls the gath’ring melody,
U||When Eolus hath from his cavern loos’d
U||The dripping south. Already had my steps,
U||Though slow, so far into that ancient wood
U||Transported me, I could not ken the place
U||Where I had enter’d, when behold! my path
U||Was bounded by a rill, which to the left
U||With little rippling waters bent the grass,
U||That issued from its brink. On earth no wave
U||How clean soe’er, that would not seem to have
U||Some mixture in itself, compar’d with this,
U||Transpicuous, clear; yet darkly on it roll’d,
U||Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne’er
U||Admits or sun or moon light there to shine.
U||My feet advanc’d not; but my wond’ring eyes
U||Pass’d onward, o’er the streamlet, to survey
U||The tender May-bloom, flush’d through many a hue,
U||In prodigal variety: and there,
U||As object, rising suddenly to view,
U||That from our bosom every thought beside
U||With the rare marvel chases, I beheld
U||A lady all alone, who, singing, went,
U||And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way
U||Was all o’er painted. “Lady beautiful!
U||Thou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart,
U||Are worthy of our trust), with love’s own beam
U||Dost warm thee,” thus to her my speech I fram’d:
U||“Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend
U||Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song.
U||Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,
U||I call to mind where wander’d and how look’d
U||Proserpine, in that season, when her child
U||The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.”
U||As when a lady, turning in the dance,
U||Doth foot it featly, and advances scarce
U||One step before the other to the ground;
U||Over the yellow and vermilion flowers
U||Thus turn’d she at my suit, most maiden-like,
U||Valing her sober eyes, and came so near,
U||That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.
U||Arriving where the limped waters now
U||Lav’d the green sward, her eyes she deign’d to raise,
U||That shot such splendour on me, as I ween
U||Ne’er glanced from Cytherea’s, when her son
U||Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.
U||Upon the opposite bank she stood and smil’d
U||through her graceful fingers shifted still
U||The intermingling dyes, which without seed
U||That lofty land unbosoms. By the stream
U||Three paces only were we sunder’d: yet
U||The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass’d it o’er,
U||(A curb for ever to the pride of man)
U||Was by Leander not more hateful held
U||For floating, with inhospitable wave
U||’Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me
U||That flood, because it gave no passage thence.
U||“Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,
U||That cradled human nature in its birth,
U||Wond’ring, ye not without suspicion view
U||My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,
U||‘Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,’ will give ye light,
U||Which may uncloud your minds. And thou, who stand’st
U||The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,
U||Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I
U||Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine.”
U||She spake; and I replied: “I know not how
U||To reconcile this wave and rustling sound
U||Of forest leaves, with what I late have heard
U||Of opposite report.” She answering thus:
U||“I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,
U||Which makes thee wonder; and so purge the cloud
U||That hath enwraps thee. The First Good, whose joy
U||Is only in himself, created man
U||For happiness, and gave this goodly place,
U||His pledge and earnest of eternal peace.
U||Favour’d thus highly, through his own defect
U||He fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,
U||And, for the bitterness of sorrow, chang’d
U||Laughter unblam’d and ever-new delight.
U||That vapours none, exhal’d from earth beneath,
U||Or from the waters (which, wherever heat
U||Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far
U||To vex man’s peaceful state, this mountain rose
U||So high toward the heav’n, nor fears the rage
U||Of elements contending, from that part
U||Exempted, where the gate his limit bars.
U||Because the circumambient air throughout
U||With its first impulse circles still, unless
U||Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;
U||Upon the summit, which on every side
U||To visitation of th’ impassive air
U||Is open, doth that motion strike, and makes
U||Beneath its sway th’ umbrageous wood resound:
U||And in the shaken plant such power resides,
U||That it impregnates with its efficacy
U||The voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle plume
U||That wafted flies abroad; and th’ other land
U||Receiving (as ’t is worthy in itself,
U||Or in the clime, that warms it), doth conceive,
U||And from its womb produces many a tree
U||Of various virtue. This when thou hast heard,
U||The marvel ceases, if in yonder earth
U||Some plant without apparent seed be found
U||To fix its fibrous stem. And further learn,
U||That with prolific foison of all seeds,
U||This holy plain is fill’d, and in itself
U||Bears fruit that ne’er was pluck’d on other soil.
U||The water, thou behold’st, springs not from vein,
U||As stream, that intermittently repairs
U||And spends his pulse of life, but issues forth
U||From fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;
U||And by the will omnific, full supply
U||Feeds whatsoe’er On either side it pours;
U||On this devolv’d with power to take away
U||Remembrance of offence, on that to bring
U||Remembrance back of every good deed done.
U||From whence its name of Lethe on this part;
U||On th’ other Eunoe: both of which must first
U||Be tasted ere it work; the last exceeding
U||All flavours else. Albeit thy thirst may now
U||Be well contented, if I here break off,
U||No more revealing: yet a corollary
U||I freely give beside: nor deem my words
U||Less grateful to thee, if they somewhat pass
U||The stretch of promise. They, whose verse of yore
U||The golden age recorded and its bliss,
U||On the Parnassian mountain, of this place
U||Perhaps had dream’d. Here was man guiltless, here
U||Perpetual spring and every fruit, and this
U||The far-fam’d nectar.” Turning to the bards,
U||When she had ceas’d, I noted in their looks
U||A smile at her conclusion; then my face
U||Again directed to the lovely dame.
U||CANTO XXIX
U||Singing, as if enamour’d, she resum’d
U||And clos’d the song, with “Blessed they whose sins
U||Are cover’d.” Like the wood-nymphs then, that tripp’d
U||Singly across the sylvan shadows, one
U||Eager to view and one to ’scape the sun,
U||So mov’d she on, against the current, up
U||The verdant rivage. I, her mincing step
U||Observing, with as tardy step pursued.
U||Between us not an hundred paces trod,
U||The bank, on each side bending equally,
U||Gave me to face the orient. Nor our way
U||Far onward brought us, when to me at once
U||She turn’d, and cried: “My brother! look and hearken.”
U||And lo! a sudden lustre ran across
U||Through the great forest on all parts, so bright
U||I doubted whether lightning were abroad;
U||But that expiring ever in the spleen,
U||That doth unfold it, and this during still
U||And waxing still in splendor, made me question
U||What it might be: and a sweet melody
U||Ran through the luminous air. Then did I chide
U||With warrantable zeal the hardihood
U||Of our first parent, for that there were earth
U||Stood in obedience to the heav’ns, she only,
U||Woman, the creature of an hour, endur’d not
U||Restraint of any veil: which had she borne
U||Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,
U||Had from the first, and long time since, been mine.
U||While through that wilderness of primy sweets
U||That never fade, suspense I walk’d, and yet
U||Expectant of beatitude more high,
U||Before us, like a blazing fire, the air
U||Under the green boughs glow’d; and, for a song,
U||Distinct the sound of melody was heard.
U||O ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes
U||If e’er I suffer’d hunger, cold and watching,
U||Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty.
U||Now through my breast let Helicon his stream
U||Pour copious; and Urania with her choir
U||Arise to aid me: while the verse unfolds
U||Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought.
U||Onward a space, what seem’d seven trees of gold,
U||The intervening distance to mine eye
U||Falsely presented; but when I was come
U||So near them, that no lineament was lost
U||Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen
U||Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,
U||Then did the faculty, that ministers
U||Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold
U||Distinguish, and it th’ singing trace the sound
U||“Hosanna.” Above, their beauteous garniture
U||Flam’d with more ample lustre, than the moon
U||Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full.
U||I turn’d me full of wonder to my guide;
U||And he did answer with a countenance
U||Charg’d with no less amazement: whence my view
U||Reverted to those lofty things, which came
U||So slowly moving towards us, that the bride
U||Would have outstript them on her bridal day.
U||The lady called aloud: “Why thus yet burns
U||Affection in thee for these living, lights,
U||And dost not look on that which follows them?”
U||I straightway mark’d a tribe behind them walk,
U||As if attendant on their leaders, cloth’d
U||With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth
U||Was never. On my left, the wat’ry gleam
U||Borrow’d, and gave me back, when there I look’d.
U||As in a mirror, my left side portray’d.
U||When I had chosen on the river’s edge
U||Such station, that the distance of the stream
U||Alone did separate me; there I stay’d
U||My steps for clearer prospect, and beheld
U||The flames go onward, leaving, as they went,
U||The air behind them painted as with trail
U||Of liveliest pencils! so distinct were mark’d
U||All those sev’n listed colours, whence the sun
U||Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone.
U||These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond
U||My vision; and ten paces, as I guess,
U||Parted the outermost. Beneath a sky
U||So beautiful, came foul and-twenty elders,
U||By two and two, with flower-de-luces crown’d.
U||All sang one song: “Blessed be thou among
U||The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness
U||Blessed for ever!” After that the flowers,
U||And the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink,
U||Were free from that elected race; as light
U||In heav’n doth second light, came after them
U||Four animals, each crown’d with verdurous leaf.
U||With six wings each was plum’d, the plumage full
U||Of eyes, and th’ eyes of Argus would be such,
U||Were they endued with life. Reader, more rhymes
U||Will not waste in shadowing forth their form:
U||For other need no straitens, that in this
U||I may not give my bounty room. But read
U||Ezekiel; for he paints them, from the north
U||How he beheld them come by Chebar’s flood,
U||In whirlwind, cloud and fire; and even such
U||As thou shalt find them character’d by him,
U||Here were they; save as to the pennons; there,
U||From him departing, John accords with me.
U||The space, surrounded by the four, enclos’d
U||A car triumphal: on two wheels it came
U||Drawn at a Gryphon’s neck; and he above
U||Stretch’d either wing uplifted, ’tween the midst
U||And the three listed hues, on each side three;
U||So that the wings did cleave or injure none;
U||And out of sight they rose. The members, far
U||As he was bird, were golden; white the rest
U||With vermeil intervein’d. So beautiful
U||A car in Rome ne’er grac’d Augustus pomp,
U||Or Africanus’: e’en the sun’s itself
U||Were poor to this, that chariot of the sun
U||Erroneous, which in blazing ruin fell
U||At Tellus’ pray’r devout, by the just doom
U||Mysterious of all-seeing Jove. Three nymphs
U||at the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;
U||The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce
U||Been known within a furnace of clear flame:
U||The next did look, as if the flesh and bones
U||Were emerald: snow new-fallen seem’d the third.
U||Now seem’d the white to lead, the ruddy now;
U||And from her song who led, the others took
U||Their treasure, swift or slow. At th’ other wheel,
U||A band quaternion, each in purple clad,
U||Advanc’d with festal step, as of them one
U||The rest conducted, one, upon whose front
U||Three eyes were seen. In rear of all this group,
U||Two old men I beheld, dissimilar
U||In raiment, but in port and gesture like,
U||Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one
U||Did show himself some favour’d counsellor
U||Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made
U||To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.
U||His fellow mark’d an opposite intent,
U||Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,
U||E’en as I view’d it with the flood between,
U||Appall’d me. Next four others I beheld,
U||Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,
U||One single old man, sleeping, as he came,
U||With a shrewd visage. And these seven, each
U||Like the first troop were habited, but wore
U||No braid of lilies on their temples wreath’d.
U||Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,
U||A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,
U||That they were all on fire above their brow.
U||Whenas the car was o’er against me, straight.
U||Was heard a thund’ring, at whose voice it seem’d
U||The chosen multitude were stay’d; for there,
U||With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt.
U||CANTO XXX
U||Soon as the polar light, which never knows
U||Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil
U||Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament
U||Of the first heav’n, to duty each one there
U||Safely convoying, as that lower doth
U||The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix’d;
U||Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van
U||Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,
U||Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:
U||And one, as if commission’d from above,
U||In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:
U||“Come, spouse, from Libanus!” and all the rest
U||Took up the song—At the last audit so
U||The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each
U||Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,
U||As, on the sacred litter, at the voice
U||Authoritative of that elder, sprang
U||A hundred ministers and messengers
U||Of life eternal. “Blessed thou! who com’st!”
U||And, “O,” they cried, “from full hands scatter ye
U||Unwith’ring lilies;” and, so saying, cast
U||Flowers over head and round them on all sides.
U||I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,
U||The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky
U||Oppos’d, one deep and beautiful serene,
U||And the sun’s face so shaded, and with mists
U||Attemper’d at lids rising, that the eye
U||Long while endur’d the sight: thus in a cloud
U||Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,
U||And down, within and outside of the car,
U||Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath’d,
U||A virgin in my view appear’d, beneath
U||Green mantle, rob’d in hue of living flame:
U||And o’er my Spirit, that in former days
U||Within her presence had abode so long,
U||No shudd’ring terror crept. Mine eyes no more
U||Had knowledge of her; yet there mov’d from her
U||A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak’d,
U||The power of ancient love was strong within me.
U||No sooner on my vision streaming, smote
U||The heav’nly influence, which years past, and e’en
U||In childhood, thrill’d me, than towards Virgil I
U||Turn’d me to leftward, panting, like a babe,
U||That flees for refuge to his mother’s breast,
U||If aught have terrified or work’d him woe:
U||And would have cried: “There is no dram of blood,
U||That doth not quiver in me. The old flame
U||Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:”
U||But Virgil had bereav’d us of himself,
U||Virgil, my best-lov’d father; Virgil, he
U||To whom I gave me up for safety: nor,
U||All, our prime mother lost, avail’d to save
U||My undew’d cheeks from blur of soiling tears.
U||“Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,
U||Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge
U||Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.”
U||As to the prow or stern, some admiral
U||Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,
U||When ’mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;
U||Thus on the left side of the car I saw,
U||(Turning me at the sound of mine own name,
U||Which here I am compell’d to register)
U||The virgin station’d, who before appeared
U||Veil’d in that festive shower angelical.
U||Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;
U||Though from her brow the veil descending, bound
U||With foliage of Minerva, suffer’d not
U||That I beheld her clearly; then with act
U||Full royal, still insulting o’er her thrall,
U||Added, as one, who speaking keepeth back
U||The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:
U||“Observe me well. I am, in sooth, I am
U||Beatrice. What! and hast thou deign’d at last
U||Approach the mountain? knewest not, O man!
U||Thy happiness is whole?” Down fell mine eyes
U||On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,
U||Recoil’d, and sought the greensward: such a weight
U||Of shame was on my forehead. With a mien
U||Of that stern majesty, which doth surround
U||mother’s presence to her awe-struck child,
U||She look’d; a flavour of such bitterness
U||Was mingled in her pity. There her words
U||Brake off, and suddenly the angels sang:
U||“In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:”
U||But went no farther than, “Thou Lord, hast set
U||My feet in ample room.” As snow, that lies
U||Amidst the living rafters on the back
U||Of Italy congeal’d when drifted high
U||And closely pil’d by rough Sclavonian blasts,
U||Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,
U||And straightway melting it distils away,
U||Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,
U||Without a sigh or tear, or ever these
U||Did sing, that with the chiming of heav’n’s sphere,
U||Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain
U||Of dulcet symphony, express’d for me
U||Their soft compassion, more than could the words
U||“Virgin, why so consum’st him?” then the ice,
U||Congeal’d about my bosom, turn’d itself
U||To spirit and water, and with anguish forth
U||Gush’d through the lips and eyelids from the heart.
U||Upon the chariot’s right edge still she stood,
U||Immovable, and thus address’d her words
U||To those bright semblances with pity touch’d:
U||“Ye in th’ eternal day your vigils keep,
U||So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,
U||Conveys from you a single step in all
U||The goings on of life: thence with more heed
U||I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,
U||Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now
U||May equal the transgression. Not alone
U||Through operation of the mighty orbs,
U||That mark each seed to some predestin’d aim,
U||As with aspect or fortunate or ill
U||The constellations meet, but through benign
U||Largess of heav’nly graces, which rain down
U||From such a height, as mocks our vision, this man
U||Was in the freshness of his being, such,
U||So gifted virtually, that in him
U||All better habits wond’rously had thriv’d.
U||The more of kindly strength is in the soil,
U||So much doth evil seed and lack of culture
U||Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness.
U||These looks sometime upheld him; for I show’d
U||My youthful eyes, and led him by their light
U||In upright walking. Soon as I had reach’d
U||The threshold of my second age, and chang’d
U||My mortal for immortal, then he left me,
U||And gave himself to others. When from flesh
U||To spirit I had risen, and increase
U||Of beauty and of virtue circled me,
U||I was less dear to him, and valued less.
U||His steps were turn’d into deceitful ways,
U||Following false images of good, that make
U||No promise perfect. Nor avail’d me aught
U||To sue for inspirations, with the which,
U||I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,
U||Did call him back; of them so little reck’d him,
U||Such depth he fell, that all device was short
U||Of his preserving, save that he should view
U||The children of perdition. To this end
U||I visited the purlieus of the dead:
U||And one, who hath conducted him thus high,
U||Receiv’d my supplications urg’d with weeping.
U||It were a breaking of God’s high decree,
U||If Lethe should be past, and such food tasted
U||Without the cost of some repentant tear.”
U||CANTO XXXI
U||“O Thou!” her words she thus without delay
U||Resuming, turn’d their point on me, to whom
U||They but with lateral edge seem’d harsh before,
U||“Say thou, who stand’st beyond the holy stream,
U||If this be true. A charge so grievous needs
U||Thine own avowal.” On my faculty
U||Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir’d
U||Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.
U||A little space refraining, then she spake:
U||“What dost thou muse on? Answer me. The wave
U||On thy remembrances of evil yet
U||Hath done no injury.” A mingled sense
U||Of fear and of confusion, from my lips
U||Did such a “Yea” produce, as needed help
U||Of vision to interpret. As when breaks
U||In act to be discharg’d, a cross-bow bent
U||Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o’erstretch’d,
U||The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;
U||Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst
U||Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice
U||Was slacken’d on its way. She straight began:
U||“When my desire invited thee to love
U||The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,
U||What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain
U||Did meet thee, that thou so should’st quit the hope
U||Of further progress, or what bait of ease
U||Or promise of allurement led thee on
U||Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere should’st rather wait?”
U||A bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found voice
U||To answer, hardly to these sounds my lips
U||Gave utterance, wailing: “Thy fair looks withdrawn,
U||Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn’d
U||My steps aside.” She answering spake: “Hadst thou
U||Been silent, or denied what thou avow’st,
U||Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more: such eye
U||Observes it. But whene’er the sinner’s cheek
U||Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears
U||Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel
U||Of justice doth run counter to the edge.
U||Howe’er that thou may’st profit by thy shame
U||For errors past, and that henceforth more strength
U||May arm thee, when thou hear’st the Siren-voice,
U||Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,
U||And lend attentive ear, while I unfold
U||How opposite a way my buried flesh
U||Should have impell’d thee. Never didst thou spy
U||In art or nature aught so passing sweet,
U||As were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame
U||Enclos’d me, and are scatter’d now in dust.
U||If sweetest thing thus fail’d thee with my death,
U||What, afterward, of mortal should thy wish
U||Have tempted? When thou first hadst felt the dart
U||Of perishable things, in my departing
U||For better realms, thy wing thou should’st have prun’d
U||To follow me, and never stoop’d again
U||To ’bide a second blow for a slight girl,
U||Or other gaud as transient and as vain.
U||The new and inexperienc’d bird awaits,
U||Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler’s aim;
U||But in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,
U||In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing’d.”
U||I stood, as children silent and asham’d
U||Stand, list’ning, with their eyes upon the earth,
U||Acknowledging their fault and self-condemn’d.
U||And she resum’d: “If, but to hear thus pains thee,
U||Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!”
U||With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,
U||Rent from its fibers by a blast, that blows
U||From off the pole, or from Iarbas’ land,
U||Than I at her behest my visage rais’d:
U||And thus the face denoting by the beard,
U||I mark’d the secret sting her words convey’d.
U||No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,
U||Than downward sunk that vision I beheld
U||Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes
U||Yet unassur’d and wavering, bent their light
U||On Beatrice. Towards the animal,
U||Who joins two natures in one form, she turn’d,
U||And, even under shadow of her veil,
U||And parted by the verdant rill, that flow’d
U||Between, in loveliness appear’d as much
U||Her former self surpassing, as on earth
U||All others she surpass’d. Remorseful goads
U||Shot sudden through me. Each thing else, the more
U||Its love had late beguil’d me, now the more
U||I Was loathsome. On my heart so keenly smote
U||The bitter consciousness, that on the ground
U||O’erpower’d I fell: and what my state was then,
U||She knows who was the cause. When now my strength
U||Flow’d back, returning outward from the heart,
U||The lady, whom alone I first had seen,
U||I found above me. “Loose me not,” she cried:
U||“Loose not thy hold;” and lo! had dragg’d me high
U||As to my neck into the stream, while she,
U||Still as she drew me after, swept along,
U||Swift as a shuttle, bounding o’er the wave.
U||The blessed shore approaching then was heard
U||So sweetly, “Tu asperges me,” that I
U||May not remember, much less tell the sound.
U||The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp’d
U||My temples, and immerg’d me, where ’t was fit
U||The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,
U||Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs
U||Presented me so lav’d, and with their arm
U||They each did cover me. “Here are we nymphs,
U||And in the heav’n are stars. Or ever earth
U||Was visited of Beatrice, we
U||Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her.
U||We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light
U||Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,
U||Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,
U||Thy sight shall quicken.” Thus began their song;
U||And then they led me to the Gryphon’s breast,
U||While, turn’d toward us, Beatrice stood.
U||“Spare not thy vision. We have stationed thee
U||Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile
U||Hath drawn his weapons on thee.” As they spake,
U||A thousand fervent wishes riveted
U||Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood
U||Still fix’d toward the Gryphon motionless.
U||As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus
U||Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,
U||For ever varying, in one figure now
U||Reflected, now in other. Reader! muse
U||How wond’rous in my sight it seem’d to mark
U||A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,
U||Yet in its imag’d semblance mutable.
U||Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul
U||Fed on the viand, whereof still desire
U||Grows with satiety, the other three
U||With gesture, that declar’d a loftier line,
U||Advanc’d: to their own carol on they came
U||Dancing in festive ring angelical.
U||“Turn, Beatrice!” was their song: “O turn
U||Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,
U||Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace
U||Hath measur’d. Gracious at our pray’r vouchsafe
U||Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark
U||Thy second beauty, now conceal’d.” O splendour!
U||O sacred light eternal! who is he
U||So pale with musing in Pierian shades,
U||Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,
U||Whose spirit should not fail him in th’ essay
U||To represent thee such as thou didst seem,
U||When under cope of the still-chiming heaven
U||Thou gav’st to open air thy charms reveal’d.
U||CANTO XXXII
U||Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,
U||Were bent to rid them of their ten years’ thirst,
U||No other sense was waking: and e’en they
U||Were fenc’d on either side from heed of aught;
U||So tangled in its custom’d toils that smile
U||Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,
U||When forcibly toward the left my sight
U||The sacred virgins turn’d; for from their lips
U||I heard the warning sounds: “Too fix’d a gaze!”
U||Awhile my vision labor’d; as when late
U||Upon the’ o’erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:
U||But soon to lesser object, as the view
U||Was now recover’d (lesser in respect
U||To that excess of sensible, whence late
U||I had perforce been sunder’d) on their right
U||I mark’d that glorious army wheel, and turn,
U||Against the sun and sev’nfold lights, their front.
U||As when, their bucklers for protection rais’d,
U||A well-rang’d troop, with portly banners curl’d,
U||Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:
U||E’en thus the goodly regiment of heav’n
U||Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car
U||Had slop’d his beam. Attendant at the wheels
U||The damsels turn’d; and on the Gryphon mov’d
U||The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,
U||No feather on him trembled. The fair dame
U||Who through the wave had drawn me, companied
U||By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,
U||Whose orbit, rolling, mark’d a lesser arch.
U||Through the high wood, now void (the more her blame,
U||Who by the serpent was beguil’d) I past
U||With step in cadence to the harmony
U||Angelic. Onward had we mov’d, as far
U||Perchance as arrow at three several flights
U||Full wing’d had sped, when from her station down
U||Descended Beatrice. With one voice
U||All murmur’d “Adam,” circling next a plant
U||Despoil’d of flowers and leaf on every bough.
U||Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,
U||Were such, as ’midst their forest wilds for height
U||The Indians might have gaz’d at. “Blessed thou!
U||Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck’d that tree
U||Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite
U||Was warp’d to evil.” Round the stately trunk
U||Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return’d
U||The animal twice-gender’d: “Yea: for so
U||The generation of the just are sav’d.”
U||And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot
U||He drew it of the widow’d branch, and bound
U||There left unto the stock whereon it grew.
U||As when large floods of radiance from above
U||Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends
U||Next after setting of the scaly sign,
U||Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew
U||His wonted colours, ere the sun have yok’d
U||Beneath another star his flamy steeds;
U||Thus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,
U||And deeper than the violet, was renew’d
U||The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare.
U||Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose.
U||I understood it not, nor to the end
U||Endur’d the harmony. Had I the skill
U||To pencil forth, how clos’d th’ unpitying eyes
U||Slumb’ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid
U||So dearly for their watching,) then like painter,
U||That with a model paints, I might design
U||The manner of my falling into sleep.
U||But feign who will the slumber cunningly;
U||I pass it by to when I wak’d, and tell
U||How suddenly a flash of splendour rent
U||The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:
U||“Arise, what dost thou?” As the chosen three,
U||On Tabor’s mount, admitted to behold
U||The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit
U||Is coveted of angels, and doth make
U||Perpetual feast in heaven, to themselves
U||Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps
U||Were broken, that they their tribe diminish’d saw,
U||Both Moses and Elias gone, and chang’d
U||The stole their master wore: thus to myself
U||Returning, over me beheld I stand
U||The piteous one, who cross the stream had brought
U||My steps. “And where,” all doubting, I exclaim’d,
U||“Is Beatrice?”—“See her,” she replied,
U||“Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root.
U||Behold th’ associate choir that circles her.
U||The others, with a melody more sweet
U||And more profound, journeying to higher realms,
U||Upon the Gryphon tend.” If there her words
U||Were clos’d, I know not; but mine eyes had now
U||Ta’en view of her, by whom all other thoughts
U||Were barr’d admittance. On the very ground
U||Alone she sat, as she had there been left
U||A guard upon the wain, which I beheld
U||Bound to the twyform beast. The seven nymphs
U||Did make themselves a cloister round about her,
U||And in their hands upheld those lights secure
U||From blast septentrion and the gusty south.
U||“A little while thou shalt be forester here:
U||And citizen shalt be forever with me,
U||Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman
U||To profit the misguided world, keep now
U||Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,
U||Take heed thou write, returning to that place.”
U||Thus Beatrice: at whose feet inclin’d
U||Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes,
U||I, as she bade, directed. Never fire,
U||With so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud
U||Leap’d downward from the welkin’s farthest bound,
U||As I beheld the bird of Jove descending
U||Pounce on the tree, and, as he rush’d, the rind,
U||Disparting crush beneath him, buds much more
U||And leaflets. On the car with all his might
U||He struck, whence, staggering like a ship, it reel’d,
U||At random driv’n, to starboard now, o’ercome,
U||And now to larboard, by the vaulting waves.
U||Next springing up into the chariot’s womb
U||A fox I saw, with hunger seeming pin’d
U||Of all good food. But, for his ugly sins
U||The saintly maid rebuking him, away
U||Scamp’ring he turn’d, fast as his hide-bound corpse
U||Would bear him. Next, from whence before he came,
U||I saw the eagle dart into the hull
U||O’ th’ car, and leave it with his feathers lin’d;
U||And then a voice, like that which issues forth
U||From heart with sorrow riv’d, did issue forth
U||From heav’n, and, “O poor bark of mine!” it cried,
U||“How badly art thou freighted!” Then, it seem’d,
U||That the earth open’d between either wheel,
U||And I beheld a dragon issue thence,
U||That through the chariot fix’d his forked train;
U||And like a wasp that draggeth back the sting,
U||So drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg’d
U||Part of the bottom forth, and went his way
U||Exulting. What remain’d, as lively turf
U||With green herb, so did clothe itself with plumes,
U||Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind
U||Been offer’d; and therewith were cloth’d the wheels,
U||Both one and other, and the beam, so quickly
U||A sigh were not breath’d sooner. Thus transform’d,
U||The holy structure, through its several parts,
U||Did put forth heads, three on the beam, and one
U||On every side; the first like oxen horn’d,
U||But with a single horn upon their front
U||The four. Like monster sight hath never seen.
U||O’er it methought there sat, secure as rock
U||On mountain’s lofty top, a shameless whore,
U||Whose ken rov’d loosely round her. At her side,
U||As ’t were that none might bear her off, I saw
U||A giant stand; and ever, and anon
U||They mingled kisses. But, her lustful eyes
U||Chancing on me to wander, that fell minion
U||Scourg’d her from head to foot all o’er; then full
U||Of jealousy, and fierce with rage, unloos’d
U||The monster, and dragg’d on, so far across
U||The forest, that from me its shades alone
U||Shielded the harlot and the new-form’d brute.
U||CANTO XXXIII
U||“The heathen, Lord! are come!” responsive thus,
U||The trinal now, and now the virgin band
U||Quaternion, their sweet psalmody began,
U||Weeping; and Beatrice listen’d, sad
U||And sighing, to the song’, in such a mood,
U||That Mary, as she stood beside the cross,
U||Was scarce more chang’d. But when they gave her place
U||To speak, then, risen upright on her feet,
U||She, with a colour glowing bright as fire,
U||Did answer: “Yet a little while, and ye
U||Shall see me not; and, my beloved sisters,
U||Again a little while, and ye shall see me.”
U||Before her then she marshall’d all the seven,
U||And, beck’ning only motion’d me, the dame,
U||And that remaining sage, to follow her.
U||So on she pass’d; and had not set, I ween,
U||Her tenth step to the ground, when with mine eyes
U||Her eyes encounter’d; and, with visage mild,
U||“So mend thy pace,” she cried, “that if my words
U||Address thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac’d
U||To hear them.” Soon as duly to her side
U||I now had hasten’d: “Brother!” she began,
U||“Why mak’st thou no attempt at questioning,
U||As thus we walk together?” Like to those
U||Who, speaking with too reverent an awe
U||Before their betters, draw not forth the voice
U||Alive unto their lips, befell me shell
U||That I in sounds imperfect thus began:
U||“Lady! what I have need of, that thou know’st,
U||And what will suit my need.” She answering thus:
U||“Of fearfulness and shame, I will, that thou
U||Henceforth do rid thee: that thou speak no more,
U||As one who dreams. Thus far be taught of me:
U||The vessel, which thou saw’st the serpent break,
U||Was and is not: let him, who hath the blame,
U||Hope not to scare God’s vengeance with a sop.
U||Without an heir for ever shall not be
U||That eagle, he, who left the chariot plum’d,
U||Which monster made it first and next a prey.
U||Plainly I view, and therefore speak, the stars
U||E’en now approaching, whose conjunction, free
U||From all impediment and bar, brings on
U||A season, in the which, one sent from God,
U||(Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him out)
U||That foul one, and th’ accomplice of her guilt,
U||The giant, both shall slay. And if perchance
U||My saying, dark as Themis or as Sphinx,
U||Fail to persuade thee, (since like them it foils
U||The intellect with blindness) yet ere long
U||Events shall be the Naiads, that will solve
U||This knotty riddle, and no damage light
U||On flock or field. Take heed; and as these words
U||By me are utter’d, teach them even so
U||To those who live that life, which is a race
U||To death: and when thou writ’st them, keep in mind
U||Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant,
U||That twice hath now been spoil’d. This whoso robs,
U||This whoso plucks, with blasphemy of deed
U||Sins against God, who for his use alone
