U||THE PURLOINED LETTER
U||   Nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio.—Seneca.
U||   At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18-, I was
U||   enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company
U||   with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or
U||   book-closet, au troisième, No. 33, Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain. For
U||   one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to
U||   any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively
U||   occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere
U||   of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain
U||   topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an
U||   earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and
U||   the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it,
U||   therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our
U||   apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur
U||   G——, the Prefect of the Parisian police.
U||   We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the
U||   entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen
U||   him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now
U||   arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without
U||   doing so, upon G.‘s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather
U||   to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had
U||   occasioned a great deal of trouble.
U||   “If it is any point requiring reflection,” observed Dupin, as he
U||   forebore to enkindle the wick, “we shall examine it to better purpose
U||   in the dark.”
U||   “That is another of your odd notions,” said the Prefect, who had a
U||   fashion of calling every thing “odd” that was beyond his comprehension,
U||   and thus lived amid an absolute legion of “oddities.”
U||   “Very true,” said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and
U||   rolled towards him a comfortable chair.
U||   “And what is the difficulty now?” I asked. “Nothing more in the
U||   assassination way, I hope?”
U||   “Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very
U||   simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently
U||   well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details
U||   of it, because it is so excessively odd.”
U||   “Simple and odd,” said Dupin.
U||   “Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been
U||   a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us
U||   altogether.”
U||   “Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at
U||   fault,” said my friend.
U||   “What nonsense you do talk!” replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.
U||   “Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,” said Dupin.
U||   “Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?”
U||   “A little too self-evident.”
U||   “Ha! ha! ha—ha! ha! ha!—ho! ho! ho!” roared our visitor, profoundly
U||   amused, “oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!”
U||   “And what, after all, is the matter on hand?” I asked.
U||   “Why, I will tell you,” replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady
U||   and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. “I will tell
U||   you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this
U||   is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most
U||   probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it
U||   to any one.”
U||   “Proceed,” said I.
U||   “Or not,” said Dupin.
U||   “Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high
U||   quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been
U||   purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is
U||   known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also,
U||   that it still remains in his possession.”
U||   “How is this known?” asked Dupin.
U||   “It is clearly inferred,” replied the Prefect, “from the nature of the
U||   document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at
U||   once arise from its passing out of the robber’s possession; that is to
U||   say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.”
U||   “Be a little more explicit,” I said.
U||   “Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a
U||   certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely
U||   valuable.” The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.
U||   “Still I do not quite understand,” said Dupin.
U||   “No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall
U||   be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most
U||   exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an
U||   ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so
U||   jeopardized.”
U||   “But this ascendancy,” I interposed, “would depend upon the robber’s
U||   knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber. Who would dare—”
U||   “The thief,” said G., “is the Minister D——, who dares all things, those
U||   unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was
U||   not less ingenious than bold. The document in question—a letter, to be
U||   frank—had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the
U||   royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the
U||   entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her
U||   wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a
U||   drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The
U||   address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the
U||   letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D——. His
U||   lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of
U||   the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and
U||   fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through
U||   in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the
U||   one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in
U||   close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen
U||   minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes
U||   also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful
U||   owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the
U||   presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister
U||   decamped; leaving his own letter—one of no importance—upon the table.”
U||   “Here, then,” said Dupin to me, “you have precisely what you demand to
U||   make the ascendancy complete—the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s
U||   knowledge of the robber.”
U||   “Yes,” replied the Prefect; “and the power thus attained has, for some
U||   months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous
U||   extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day,
U||   of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot
U||   be done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the
U||   matter to me.”
U||   “Than whom,” said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, “no more
U||   sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.”
U||   “You flatter me,” replied the Prefect; “but it is possible that some
U||   such opinion may have been entertained.”
U||   “It is clear,” said I, “as you observe, that the letter is still in
U||   possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any
U||   employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment
U||   the power departs.”
U||   “True,” said G.; “and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care
U||   was to make thorough search of the minister’s hotel; and here my chief
U||   embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.
U||   Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result
U||   from giving him reason to suspect our design.”
U||   “But,” said I, “you are quite au fait in these investigations. The
U||   Parisian police have done this thing often before.”
U||   “Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the
U||   minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from
U||   home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a
U||   distance from their master’s apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans,
U||   are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open
U||   any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not
U||   passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged,
U||   personally, in ransacking the D—— Hotel. My honor is interested, and,
U||   to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon
U||   the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more
U||   astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and
U||   corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be
U||   concealed.”
U||   “But is it not possible,” I suggested, “that although the letter may be
U||   in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have
U||   concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?”
U||   “This is barely possible,” said Dupin. “The present peculiar condition
U||   of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D—— is
U||   known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the
U||   document—its susceptibility of being produced at a moment’s notice—a
U||   point of nearly equal importance with its possession.”
U||   “Its susceptibility of being produced?” said I.
U||   “That is to say, of being destroyed,” said Dupin.
U||   “True,” I observed; “the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As
U||   for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as
U||   out of the question.”
U||   “Entirely,” said the Prefect. “He has been twice waylaid, as if by
U||   footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.”
U||   “You might have spared yourself this trouble,” said Dupin. “D——, I
U||   presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated
U||   these waylayings, as a matter of course.”
U||   “Not altogether a fool,” said G., “but then he’s a poet, which I take
U||   to be only one remove from a fool.”
U||   “True,” said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his
U||   meerschaum, “although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.”
U||   “Suppose you detail,” said I, “the particulars of your search.”
U||   “Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched everywhere. I have
U||   had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room
U||   by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined,
U||   first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible
U||   drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police
U||   agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt
U||   who permits a ‘secret’ drawer to escape him in a search of this kind.
U||   The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk—of space—to be
U||   accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The
U||   fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took
U||   the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have
U||   seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops.”
U||   “Why so?”
U||   “Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of
U||   furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then
U||   the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the
U||   top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same
U||   way.”
U||   “But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?” I asked.
U||   “By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding
U||   of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to
U||   proceed without noise.”
U||   “But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to pieces all
U||   articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a
U||   deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a
U||   thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large
U||   knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of
U||   a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?”
U||   “Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of every chair
U||   in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every description of
U||   furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any
U||   traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it
U||   instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been
U||   as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing—any unusual gaping
U||   in the joints—would have sufficed to insure detection.”
U||   “I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the
U||   plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the
U||   curtains and carpets.”
U||   “That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of
U||   the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We
U||   divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so
U||   that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square
U||   inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately
U||   adjoining, with the microscope, as before.”
U||   “The two houses adjoining!” I exclaimed; “you must have had a great
U||   deal of trouble.”
U||   “We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!”
U||   “You include the grounds about the houses?”
U||   “All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively
U||   little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it
U||   undisturbed.”
U||   “You looked among D——‘s papers, of course, and into the books of the
U||   library?”
U||   “Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened
U||   every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not
U||   contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of
U||   some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every
U||   book-cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each
U||   the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings
U||   been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that
U||   the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes,
U||   just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally,
U||   with the needles.”
U||   “You explored the floors beneath the carpets?”
U||   “Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with
U||   the microscope.”
U||   “And the paper on the walls?”
U||   “Yes.”
U||   “You looked into the cellars?”
U||   “We did.”
U||   “Then,” I said, “you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter
U||   is not upon the premises, as you suppose.”
U||   “I fear you are right there,” said the Prefect. “And now, Dupin, what
U||   would you advise me to do?”
U||   “To make a thorough re-search of the premises.”
U||   “That is absolutely needless,” replied G——. “I am not more sure that I
U||   breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.”
U||   “I have no better advice to give you,” said Dupin. “You have, of
U||   course, an accurate description of the letter?”
U||   “Oh yes!”—And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book, proceeded
U||   to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the
U||   external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing the
U||   perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely
U||   depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.
U||   In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us
U||   occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered
U||   into some ordinary conversation. At length I said,—
U||   “Well, but G——, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at
U||   last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the
U||   Minister?”
U||   “Confound him, say I—yes; I made the re-examination, however, as Dupin
U||   suggested—but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.”
U||   “How much was the reward offered, did you say?” asked Dupin.
U||   “Why, a very great deal—a very liberal reward—I don’t like to say how
U||   much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn’t mind giving
U||   my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could
U||   obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more
U||   importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it
U||   were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.”
U||   “Why, yes,” said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his
U||   meerschaum, “I really—think, G——, you have not exerted yourself—to the
U||   utmost in this matter. You might—do a little more, I think, eh?”
U||   “How?—in what way?”
U||   “Why—puff, puff—you might—puff, puff—employ counsel in the matter,
U||   eh?—puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of
U||   Abernethy?”
U||   “No; hang Abernethy!”
U||   “To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain
U||   rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a
U||   medical opinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation
U||   in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that
U||   of an imaginary individual.
U||   “‘We will suppose,’ said the miser, ‘that his symptoms are such and
U||   such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?’
U||   “‘Take!’ said Abernethy, ‘why, take advice, to be sure.’”
U||   “But,” said the Prefect, a little discomposed, “I am perfectly willing
U||   to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand
U||   francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.”
U||   “In that case,” replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a
U||   check-book, “you may as well fill me up a check for the amount
U||   mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.”
U||   I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For
U||   some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking
U||   incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed
U||   starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in
U||   some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant
U||   stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs,
U||   and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it
U||   carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an
U||   escritoire, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This
U||   functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a
U||   trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then,
U||   scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously
U||   from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable
U||   since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.
U||   When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.
U||   “The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their way.
U||   They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the
U||   knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G——
U||   detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D——, I
U||   felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory
U||   investigation—so far as his labors extended.”
U||   “So far as his labors extended?” said I.
U||   “Yes,” said Dupin. “The measures adopted were not only the best of
U||   their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been
U||   deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond
U||   a question, have found it.”
U||   I merely laughed—but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.
U||   “The measures, then,” he continued, “were good in their kind, and well
U||   executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and
U||   to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the
U||   Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his
U||   designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for
U||   the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he.
U||   I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the
U||   game of ‘even and odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is
U||   simple, and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a
U||   number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is
U||   even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he
U||   loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school.
U||   Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere
U||   observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For
U||   example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his
U||   closed hand, asks, ‘are they even or odd?’ Our schoolboy replies,
U||   ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says
U||   to himself, ‘the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his
U||   amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the
U||   second; I will therefore guess odd;’—he guesses odd, and wins. Now,
U||   with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus:
U||   ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in
U||   the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a
U||   simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then
U||   a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and
U||   finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore
U||   guess even;’—he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in
U||   the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed ‘lucky,’—what, in its last
U||   analysis, is it?”
U||   “It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner’s intellect
U||   with that of his opponent.”
U||   “It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he
U||   effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I
U||   received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to find out how wise, or how
U||   stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts
U||   at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as
U||   possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to
U||   see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to
U||   match or correspond with the expression.’ This response of the
U||   schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has
U||   been attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to
U||   Campanella.”
U||   “And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner’s intellect with
U||   that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the
U||   accuracy with which the opponent’s intellect is admeasured.”
U||   “For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin; “and the
U||   Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this
U||   identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through
U||   non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They
U||   consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for
U||   anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have
U||   hidden it. They are right in this much—that their own ingenuity is a
U||   faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of
U||   the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon
U||   foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own,
U||   and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle
U||   in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual
U||   emergency—by some extraordinary reward—they extend or exaggerate their
U||   old modes of practice, without touching their principles. What, for
U||   example, in this case of D——, has been done to vary the principle of
U||   action? What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and
U||   scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the
U||   building into registered square inches—what is it all but an
U||   exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of
U||   principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions
U||   regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of
U||   his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for
U||   granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,—not exactly in a
U||   gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg—but, at least, in some out-of-the-way
U||   hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge
U||   a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do
U||   you not see also, that such recherchés nooks for concealment are
U||   adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by
U||   ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of
U||   the article concealed—a disposal of it in this recherché manner,—is, in
U||   the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and thus its
U||   discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the
U||   mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the
U||   case is of importance—or, what amounts to the same thing in the
U||   political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,—the qualities in
U||   question have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I
U||   meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any
U||   where within the limits of the Prefect’s examination—in other words,
U||   had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the
U||   principles of the Prefect—its discovery would have been a matter
U||   altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been
U||   thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the
U||   supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown
U||   as a poet. All fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is
U||   merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all
U||   poets are fools.”
U||   “But is this really the poet?” I asked. “There are two brothers, I
U||   know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I
U||   believe has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a
U||   mathematician, and no poet.”
U||   “You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and
U||   mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could
U||   not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the
U||   Prefect.”
U||   “You surprise me,” I said, “by these opinions, which have been
U||   contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at
U||   naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has
U||   long been regarded as the reason par excellence.”
U||   “‘Il y a à parièr,’” replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, “‘que toute
U||   idée publique, toute convention reçue est une sottise, car elle a
U||   convenue au plus grand nombre.’ The mathematicians, I grant you, have
U||   done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude,
U||   and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With
U||   an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the
U||   term ‘analysis’ into application to algebra. The French are the
U||   originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any
U||   importance—if words derive any value from applicability—then ‘analysis’
U||   conveys ‘algebra’ about as much as, in Latin, ‘ambitus’ implies
U||   ‘ambition,’ ‘religio’ ‘religion,’ or ‘homines honesti’ a set of
U||   honorable men.”
U||   “You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the
U||   algebraists of Paris; but proceed.”
U||   “I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which
U||   is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I
U||   dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The
U||   mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical
U||   reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and
U||   quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of
U||   what is called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this
U||   error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with
U||   which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of
U||   general truth. What is true of relation—of form and quantity—is often
U||   grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science
U||   it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the
U||   whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of
U||   motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not,
U||   necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values
U||   apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only
U||   truths within the limits of relation. But the mathematician argues,
U||   from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely
U||   general applicability—as the world indeed imagines them to be. Bryant,
U||   in his very learned ‘Mythology,’ mentions an analogous source of error,
U||   when he says that ‘although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we
U||   forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing
U||   realities.’ With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans themselves,
U||   the ‘Pagan fables’ are believed, and the inferences are made, not so
U||   much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable addling of
U||   the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician
U||   who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not
U||   clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x^2+px was
U||   absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these
U||   gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe
U||   occasions may occur where x^2+px is not altogether equal to q, and,
U||   having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as
U||   speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock
U||   you down.
U||   “I mean to say,” continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last
U||   observations, “that if the Minister had been no more than a
U||   mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving
U||   me this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and
U||   my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the
U||   circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier,
U||   too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail
U||   to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have
U||   failed to anticipate—and events have proved that he did not fail to
U||   anticipate—the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have
U||   foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His
U||   frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect
U||   as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford
U||   opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to
U||   impress them with the conviction to which G——, in fact, did finally
U||   arrive—the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I
U||   felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains
U||   in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of
U||   policial action in searches for articles concealed—I felt that this
U||   whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the
U||   Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary
U||   nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to
U||   see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as
U||   open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the
U||   gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he
U||   would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not
U||   deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember,
U||   perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our
U||   first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so
U||   much on account of its being so very self-evident.”
U||   “Yes,” said I, “I remember his merriment well. I really thought he
U||   would have fallen into convulsions.”
U||   “The material world,” continued Dupin, “abounds with very strict
U||   analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been
U||   given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to
U||   strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. The
U||   principle of the vis inertiæ, for example, seems to be identical in
U||   physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former, that a
U||   large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one,
U||   and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty,
U||   than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity,
U||   while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their
U||   movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved,
U||   and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of
U||   their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs,
U||   over the shop-doors, are the most attractive of attention?”
U||   “I have never given the matter a thought,” I said.
U||   “There is a game of puzzles,” he resumed, “which is played upon a map.
U||   One party playing requires another to find a given word—the name of
U||   town, river, state or empire—any word, in short, upon the motley and
U||   perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to
U||   embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered
U||   names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large
U||   characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the
U||   over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape
U||   observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical
U||   oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which
U||   the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are
U||   too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it
U||   appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He
U||   never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister had
U||   deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world,
U||   by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.
U||   “But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating
U||   ingenuity of D——; upon the fact that the document must always have been
U||   at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the
U||   decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden
U||   within the limits of that dignitary’s ordinary search—the more
U||   satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had
U||   resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting
U||   to conceal it at all.
U||   “Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green
U||   spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the
U||   Ministerial hotel. I found D—— at home, yawning, lounging, and
U||   dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of
U||   ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now
U||   alive—but that is only when nobody sees him.
U||   “To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the
U||   necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and
U||   thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only
U||   upon the conversation of my host.
U||   “I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat,
U||   and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other
U||   papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here,
U||   however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to
U||   excite particular suspicion.
U||   “At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a
U||   trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a
U||   dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of
U||   the mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments,
U||   were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was
U||   much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the
U||   middle—as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as
U||   worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a large
U||   black seal, bearing the D—— cipher very conspicuously, and was
U||   addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D——, the minister, himself.
U||   It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into
U||   one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.
U||   “No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be that
U||   of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance,
U||   radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so
U||   minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D——
U||   cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S——
U||   family. Here, the address, to the Minister, diminutive and feminine;
U||   there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly
U||   bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But,
U||   then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the
U||   dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with
U||   the true methodical habits of D——, and so suggestive of a design to
U||   delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the
U||   document—these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of
U||   this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in
U||   accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived;
U||   these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one
U||   who came with the intention to suspect.
U||   “I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a
U||   most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew
U||   well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention
U||   really riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to
U||   memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also
U||   fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial
U||   doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper,
U||   I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented
U||   the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having
U||   been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed
U||   direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original
U||   fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter
U||   had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I
U||   bade the Minister good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving
U||   a gold snuff-box upon the table.
U||   “The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite
U||   eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged,
U||   however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately
U||   beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of
U||   fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D—— rushed to a
U||   casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to
U||   the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by
U||   a fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully
U||   prepared at my lodgings—imitating the D—— cipher, very readily, by
U||   means of a seal formed of bread.
U||   “The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic
U||   behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women
U||   and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the
U||   fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he
U||   had gone, D—— came from the window, whither I had followed him
U||   immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade
U||   him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.”
U||   “But what purpose had you,” I asked, “in replacing the letter by a
U||   fac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have
U||   seized it openly, and departed?”
U||   “D——,” replied Dupin, “is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His
U||   hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I
U||   made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the
U||   Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard
U||   of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You
U||   know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan
U||   of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in
U||   his power. She has now him in hers—since, being unaware that the letter
U||   is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it
U||   was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political
U||   destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than
U||   awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus
U||   Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it
U||   is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I
U||   have no sympathy—at least no pity—for him who descends. He is that
U||   monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however,
U||   that I should like very well to know the precise character of his
U||   thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain
U||   personage’ he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in
U||   the card-rack.”
U||   “How? did you put any thing particular in it?”
U||   “Why—it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank—that
U||   would have been insulting. D——, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn,
U||   which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as
U||   I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the
U||   person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a
U||   clue. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the
U||   middle of the blank sheet the words—
U||   “‘— — Un dessein si funeste,
U||   S’il n’est digne d’Atrée, est digne de Thyeste.
U||   They are to be found in Crébillon’s ‘Atrée.’”
U||THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE
U||   Truth is stranger than fiction.—Old Saying
U||   Having had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental
U||   investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsöornot, a work which
U||   (like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in
U||   Europe; and which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any
U||   American—if we except, perhaps, the author of the “Curiosities of
U||   American Literature”;—having had occasion, I say, to turn over some
U||   pages of the first-mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little
U||   astonished to discover that the literary world has hitherto been
U||   strangely in error respecting the fate of the vizier’s daughter,
U||   Scheherazade, as that fate is depicted in the “Arabian Nights”; and
U||   that the dénouement there given, if not altogether inaccurate, as far
U||   as it goes, is at least to blame in not having gone very much farther.
U||   For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the
U||   inquisitive reader to the “Isitsöornot” itself; but in the meantime, I
U||   shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered.
U||   It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a
U||   certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not only
U||   puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to
U||   espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and the
U||   next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.
U||   Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with a
U||   religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him
U||   as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted one
U||   afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier,
U||   to whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.
U||   Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would either
U||   redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or perish,
U||   after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.
U||   Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (which
U||   makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the
U||   grand vizier, to make an offer to the king of her hand. This hand the
U||   king eagerly accepts—(he had intended to take it at all events, and had
U||   put off the matter from day to day, only through fear of the
U||   vizier),—but, in accepting it now, he gives all parties very distinctly
U||   to understand, that, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the
U||   slightest design of giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges.
U||   When, therefore, the fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king,
U||   and did actually marry him despite her father’s excellent advice not to
U||   do any thing of the kind—when she would and did marry him, I say, will
U||   I, nill I, it was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as
U||   the nature of the case would allow.
U||   It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading
U||   Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in her
U||   mind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget what
U||   specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near
U||   that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed;
U||   and, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the good
U||   monarch, her husband (who bore her none the worse will because he
U||   intended to wring her neck on the morrow),—she managed to awaken him, I
U||   say, (although on account of a capital conscience and an easy
U||   digestion, he slept well) by the profound interest of a story (about a
U||   rat and a black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an
U||   undertone, of course) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened
U||   that this history was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade,
U||   in the nature of things could not finish it just then, since it was
U||   high time for her to get up and be bowstrung—a thing very little more
U||   pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel!
U||   The king’s curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even over
U||   his sound religious principles, induced him for this once to postpone
U||   the fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and with
U||   the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black
U||   cat (a black cat, I think it was) and the rat.
U||   The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only put
U||   the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was blue)
U||   but before she well knew what she was about, found herself deep in the
U||   intricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not altogether
U||   mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went, in a violent
U||   manner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo key. With this
U||   history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the
U||   other—and, as the day broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding all
U||   the queen’s endeavors to get through with it in time for the
U||   bowstringing), there was again no resource but to postpone that
U||   ceremony as before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there
U||   happened a similar accident with a similar result; and then the
U||   next—and then again the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch,
U||   having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow
U||   during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights, either
U||   forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time, or gets himself
U||   absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more probable) breaks it
U||   outright, as well as the head of his father confessor. At all events,
U||   Scheherazade, who, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir,
U||   perhaps, to the whole seven baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we
U||   all know, picked up from under the trees in the garden of Eden;
U||   Scheherazade, I say, finally triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was
U||   repealed.
U||   Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it upon
U||   record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant—but alas! like a
U||   great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true, and I am
U||   indebted altogether to the “Isitsöornot” for the means of correcting
U||   the error. “Le mieux,” says a French proverb, “est l’ennemi du bien,”
U||   and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of
U||   talk, I should have added that she put them out at compound interest
U||   until they amounted to seventy-seven.
U||   “My dear sister,” said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I quote
U||   the language of the “Isitsöornot” at this point, verbatim) “my dear
U||   sister,” said she, “now that all this little difficulty about the
U||   bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily
U||   repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion in
U||   withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry to say, snores—a
U||   thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor.
U||   This person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures
U||   than those which I related; but the truth is, I felt sleepy on the
U||   particular night of their narration, and so was seduced into cutting
U||   them short—a grievous piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that
U||   Allah will forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy my
U||   great neglect—and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in
U||   order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible
U||   noise, I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases) with the
U||   sequel of this very remarkable story.”
U||   Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the
U||   “Isitsöornot,” expressed no very particular intensity of gratification;
U||   but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at length ceased
U||   snoring, and finally said, “Hum!” and then “Hoo!” when the queen,
U||   understanding these words (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify that
U||   he was all attention, and would do his best not to snore any more—the
U||   queen, I say, having arranged these matters to her satisfaction,
U||   re-entered thus, at once, into the history of Sinbad the sailor:
U||   “‘At length, in my old age,’ [these are the words of Sinbad himself, as
U||   retailed by Scheherazade]—‘at length, in my old age, and after enjoying
U||   many years of tranquillity at home, I became once more possessed of a
U||   desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day, without acquainting
U||   any of my family with my design, I packed up some bundles of such
U||   merchandise as was most precious and least bulky, and, engaging a
U||   porter to carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to await the
U||   arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom
U||   into some region which I had not as yet explored.
U||   “‘Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down beneath
U||   some trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a
U||   ship, but during several hours we saw none whatever. At length I
U||   fancied that I could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound; and the
U||   porter, after listening awhile, declared that he also could distinguish
U||   it. Presently it grew louder, and then still louder, so that we could
U||   have no doubt that the object which caused it was approaching us. At
U||   length, on the edge of the horizon, we discovered a black speck, which
U||   rapidly increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster,
U||   swimming with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It
U||   came toward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of
U||   foam around its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea
U||   through which it passed, with a long line of fire that extended far off
U||   into the distance.
U||   “‘As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length was
U||   equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and it was as
U||   wide as the great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime and
U||   munificent of the Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary
U||   fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness throughout all
U||   that portion of it which floated above the water, with the exception of
U||   a narrow blood-red streak that completely begirdled it. The belly,
U||   which floated beneath the surface, and of which we could get only a
U||   glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was
U||   entirely covered with metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon
U||   in misty weather. The back was flat and nearly white, and from it there
U||   extended upwards of six spines, about half the length of the whole
U||   body.
U||   “‘This horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive; but, as
U||   if to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least four
U||   score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of the
U||   green dragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two rows,
U||   one above the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which seemed
U||   to answer the purpose of an eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful
U||   eyes were much larger than the others, and had the appearance of solid
U||   gold.
U||   “‘Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with the
U||   greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy—for
U||   it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings
U||   like the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor
U||   yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels. Its head and its tail
U||   were shaped precisely alike, only, not far from the latter, were two
U||   small holes that served for nostrils, and through which the monster
U||   puffed out its thick breath with prodigious violence, and with a
U||   shrieking, disagreeable noise.
U||   “‘Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but it was
U||   even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a nearer look, we
U||   perceived upon the creature’s back a vast number of animals about the
U||   size and shape of men, and altogether much resembling them, except that
U||   they wore no garments (as men do), being supplied (by nature, no doubt)
U||   with an ugly uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but
U||   fitting so tight to the skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably
U||   awkward, and put them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of
U||   their heads were certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I
U||   thought might have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon
U||   discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore
U||   concluded they were contrivances designed, by their great weight, to
U||   keep the heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders.
U||   Around the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges
U||   of servitude, no doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only much wider
U||   and infinitely stiffer, so that it was quite impossible for these poor
U||   victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at
U||   the same time; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of
U||   their noses—a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively
U||   in an awful degree.
U||   “‘When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, it
U||   suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted from
U||   it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, and
U||   a noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the smoke cleared
U||   away, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of the
U||   large beast with a trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to
U||   his mouth) he presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable
U||   accents, that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they
U||   not come altogether through the nose.
U||   “‘Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as I
U||   could in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficulty I
U||   turned to the porter, who was near swooning through affright, and
U||   demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was, what
U||   it wanted, and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon
U||   its back. To this the porter replied, as well as he could for
U||   trepidation, that he had once before heard of this sea-beast; that it
U||   was a cruel demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire, created by
U||   evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the
U||   things upon its back were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and
U||   dogs, only a little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had
U||   their uses, however evil—for, through the torture they caused the beast
U||   by their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree of
U||   wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil
U||   the vengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.
U||   “This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once even
U||   looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while the
U||   porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction, so
U||   that, by these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, of
U||   which I have no doubt he took excellent care—although this is a point I
U||   cannot determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again.
U||   “‘For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin (who
U||   had come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon overtaken, bound
U||   hand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam out
U||   again into the middle of the sea.
U||   “‘I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to
U||   peril my life in such adventures as this; but regret being useless, I
U||   made the best of my condition, and exerted myself to secure the
U||   goodwill of the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to
U||   exercise authority over his fellows. I succeeded so well in this
U||   endeavor that, in a few days, the creature bestowed upon me various
U||   tokens of his favor, and in the end even went to the trouble of
U||   teaching me the rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its
U||   language; so that, at length, I was enabled to converse with it
U||   readily, and came to make it comprehend the ardent desire I had of
U||   seeing the world.
U||   “‘Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt
U||   grumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,’ said he to me, one day after dinner—but I
U||   beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your majesty is not
U||   conversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so the man-animals were
U||   called; I presume because their language formed the connecting link
U||   between that of the horse and that of the rooster). With your
U||   permission, I will translate. ‘Washish squashish,’ and so forth:—that
U||   is to say, ‘I am happy to find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really a
U||   very excellent fellow; we are now about doing a thing which is called
U||   circumnavigating the globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing the
U||   world, I will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of
U||   the beast.’”
U||   When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the
U||   “Isitsöornot,” the king turned over from his left side to his right,
U||   and said:
U||   “It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you omitted,
U||   hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know I think them
U||   exceedingly entertaining and strange?”
U||   The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair
U||   Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:
U||   “Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative—‘I thanked the
U||   man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much at home on
U||   the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean; although
U||   the surface of the latter is, in that part of the world, by no means
U||   flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we went—so to say—either up
U||   hill or down hill all the time.’
U||   “That I think, was very singular,” interrupted the king.
U||   “Nevertheless, it is quite true,” replied Scheherazade.
U||   “I have my doubts,” rejoined the king; “but, pray, be so good as to go
U||   on with the story.”
U||   “I will,” said the queen. “‘The beast,’ continued Sinbad to the caliph,
U||   ‘swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at length, we
U||   arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in circumference, but
U||   which, nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea by a
U||   colony of little things like caterpillars.’” (*1)
U||   “Hum!” said the king.
U||   “‘Leaving this island,’ said Sinbad—(for Scheherazade, it must be
U||   understood, took no notice of her husband’s ill-mannered ejaculation)
U||   ‘leaving this island, we came to another where the forests were of
U||   solid stone, and so hard that they shivered to pieces the
U||   finest-tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut them down.’” (*2)
U||   “Hum!” said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no attention,
U||   continued in the language of Sinbad.
U||   “‘Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where there was
U||   a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the
U||   bowels of the earth, and that contained a greater number of far more
U||   spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all
U||   Damascus and Bagdad. From the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads
U||   of gems, like diamonds, but larger than men; and in among the streets
U||   of towers and pyramids and temples, there flowed immense rivers as
U||   black as ebony, and swarming with fish that had no eyes.’” (*3)
U||   “Hum!” said the king.
U||   “‘We then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty
U||   mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal,
U||   some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long (*4); while
U||   from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a quantity of ashes that
U||   the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and it became darker
U||   than the darkest midnight; so that when we were even at the distance of
U||   a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain, it was impossible to see
U||   the whitest object, however close we held it to our eyes.’” (*5)
U||   “Hum!” said the king.
U||   “‘After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until we
U||   met with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed—for we
U||   here saw a great lake, at the bottom of which, more than a hundred feet
U||   beneath the surface of the water, there flourished in full leaf a
U||   forest of tall and luxuriant trees.’” (*6)
U||   “Hoo!” said the king.
U||   “Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the
U||   atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our own
U||   does feather.’” (*7)
U||   “Fiddle de dee,” said the king.
U||   “Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at the
U||   most magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there meandered
U||   a glorious river for several thousands of miles. This river was of
U||   unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than that of amber. It
U||   was from three to six miles in width; and its banks which arose on
U||   either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height, were
U||   crowned with ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers,
U||   that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden; but the name of this
U||   luxuriant land was the Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was
U||   inevitable death.’” (*8)
U||   “Humph!” said the king.
U||   “‘We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came to
U||   another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous
U||   animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads. These hideous
U||   beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel shape,
U||   and line the sides of them with rocks, so disposed one upon the other
U||   that they fall instantly, when trodden upon by other animals, thus
U||   precipitating them into the monster’s dens, where their blood is
U||   immediately sucked, and their carcasses afterwards hurled
U||   contemptuously out to an immense distance from “the caverns of
U||   death."’” (*9)
U||   “Pooh!” said the king.
U||   “‘Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with vegetables that
U||   grew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10) There were others that
U||   sprang from the substance of other vegetables; (*11) others that
U||   derived their substance from the bodies of living animals; (*12) and
U||   then again, there were others that glowed all over with intense fire;
U||   (*13) others that moved from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what
U||   was still more wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed
U||   and moved their limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable passion
U||   of mankind for enslaving other creatures, and confining them in horrid
U||   and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.’” (*15)
U||   “Pshaw!” said the king.
U||   “‘Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the bees and
U||   the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition, that they
U||   give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men of
U||   the empire. The king of the place having offered a reward for the
U||   solution of two very difficult problems, they were solved upon the
U||   spot—the one by the bees, and the other by the birds; but the king
U||   keeping their solution a secret, it was only after the most profound
U||   researches and labor, and the writing of an infinity of big books,
U||   during a long series of years, that the men-mathematicians at length
U||   arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot
U||   by the bees and by the birds.’” (*16)
U||   “Oh my!” said the king.
U||   “‘We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves
U||   close upon another, from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock
U||   of fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and forty miles long; so
U||   that, although they flew a mile during every minute, it required no
U||   less than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us—in which there
U||   were several millions of millions of fowl.’” (*17)
U||   “Oh fy!” said the king.
U||   “‘No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us great
U||   annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of
U||   another kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in
U||   my former voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on
U||   your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This terrible fowl had
U||   no head that we could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly,
U||   which was of a prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking
U||   substance, smooth, shining and striped with various colors. In its
U||   talons, the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a
U||   house from which it had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of
U||   which we distinctly saw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a
U||   state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited them. We
U||   shouted with all our might, in the hope of frightening the bird into
U||   letting go of its prey, but it merely gave a snort or puff, as if of
U||   rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved to be
U||   filled with sand!’”
U||   “Stuff!” said the king.
U||   “‘It was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of
U||   immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which, nevertheless, was
U||   supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer
U||   than four hundred horns.’” (*18)
U||   “That, now, I believe,” said the king, “because I have read something
U||   of the kind before, in a book.”
U||   “‘We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in between
U||   the legs of the cow), and, after some hours, found ourselves in a
U||   wonderful country indeed, which, I was informed by the man-animal, was
U||   his own native land, inhabited by things of his own species. This
U||   elevated the man-animal very much in my esteem, and in fact, I now
U||   began to feel ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had
U||   treated him; for I found that the man-animals in general were a nation
U||   of the most powerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain,
U||   (*19) which, no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful
U||   writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of
U||   imagination!’”
U||   “Nonsense!” said the king.
U||   “‘Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very
U||   singular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones were
U||   iron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he had black
U||   stones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he was
U||   so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the
U||   grandest temple in this city, at a rate surpassing that of the flight
U||   of most birds.’” (*20)
U||   “Twattle!” said the king.
U||   “‘I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but bigger
U||   than a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick; her
U||   blood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she was nearly
U||   related,) was boiling water; and like him she ate nothing but wood or
U||   black stones. This hen brought forth very frequently, a hundred
U||   chickens in the day; and, after birth, they took up their residence for
U||   several weeks within the stomach of their mother.’” (*21)
U||   “Fal lal!” said the king.
U||   “‘One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and
U||   wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would
U||   have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with the exception of the
U||   great Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22) Another of these magi constructed
U||   (of like material) a creature that put to shame even the genius of him
U||   who made it; for so great were its reasoning powers that, in a second,
U||   it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have
U||   required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year.
U||   (*23) But a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a
U||   mighty thing that was neither man nor beast, but which had brains of
U||   lead, intermixed with a black matter like pitch, and fingers that it
U||   employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it would have
U||   had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies of the Koran in an
U||   hour, and this with so exquisite a precision, that in all the copies
U||   there should not be found one to vary from another by the breadth of
U||   the finest hair. This thing was of prodigious strength, so that it
U||   erected or overthrew the mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers
U||   were exercised equally for evil and for good.’”
U||   “Ridiculous!” said the king.
U||   “‘Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his
U||   veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of sitting
U||   down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner was
U||   thoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had the faculty of
U||   converting the common metals into gold, without even looking at them
U||   during the process. (*25) Another had such a delicacy of touch that he
U||   made a wire so fine as to be invisible. (*26) Another had such
U||   quickness of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an
U||   elastic body, while it was springing backward and forward at the rate
U||   of nine hundred millions of times in a second.’” (*27)
U||   “Absurd!” said the king.
U||   “‘Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet
U||   saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms, kick
U||   out their legs, fight, or even get up and dance at his will. (*28)
U||   Another had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could
U||   have made himself heard from one end of the world to the other. (*29)
U||   Another had so long an arm that he could sit down in Damascus and
U||   indite a letter at Bagdad—or indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30)
U||   Another commanded the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens,
U||   and it came at his call; and served him for a plaything when it came.
U||   Another took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another
U||   constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31) Another
U||   made ice in a red-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the sun to paint
U||   his portrait, and the sun did. (*33) Another took this luminary with
U||   the moon and the planets, and having first weighed them with scrupulous
U||   accuracy, probed into their depths and found out the solidity of the
U||   substance of which they were made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of
U||   so surprising a necromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor
U||   their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects
U||   that do not exist at all, or that for twenty millions of years before
U||   the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from the face of
U||   creation.’” (*34)
U||   “Preposterous!” said the king.
U||   “‘The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi,’”
U||   continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner disturbed by these
U||   frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her
U||   husband—“‘the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every
U||   thing that is accomplished and refined; and would be every thing that
U||   is interesting and beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets
U||   them, and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands
U||   and fathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities come
U||   in certain shapes, and some in others—but this of which I speak has
U||   come in the shape of a crotchet.’”
U||   “A what?” said the king.
U||   “‘A crotchet’” said Scheherazade. “‘One of the evil genii, who are
U||   perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into the heads of
U||   these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal
U||   beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies
U||   not very far below the small of the back. Perfection of loveliness,
U||   they say, is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having
U||   been long possessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that
U||   country, the days have long gone by since it was possible to
U||   distinguish a woman from a dromedary—’”
U||   “Stop!” said the king—“I can’t stand that, and I won’t. You have
U||   already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day, too, I
U||   perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been married?—my
U||   conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And then that dromedary
U||   touch—do you take me for a fool? Upon the whole, you might as well get
U||   up and be throttled.”
U||   These words, as I learn from the “Isitsöornot,” both grieved and
U||   astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of
U||   scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she
U||   submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however, great
U||   consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the
U||   reflection that much of the history remained still untold, and that the
U||   petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous
U||   reward, in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.
U||A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM.
U||   The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways; nor
U||   are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness,
U||   profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have a depth in
U||   them greater than the well of Democritus.
U||   —Joseph Glanville.
U||   We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes
U||   the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.
U||   “Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you on this
U||   route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past,
U||   there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man—or
U||   at least such as no man ever survived to tell of—and the six hours of
U||   deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You
U||   suppose me a very old man—but I am not. It took less than a single day
U||   to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs,
U||   and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and
U||   am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look over this
U||   little cliff without getting giddy?”
U||   The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself
U||   down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while
U||   he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme
U||   and slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose, a sheer unobstructed
U||   precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet
U||   from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me to
U||   within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I
U||   excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full
U||   length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not
U||   even glance upward at the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest
U||   myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in
U||   danger from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason
U||   myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the
U||   distance.
U||   “You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have brought
U||   you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of
U||   that event I mentioned—and to tell you the whole story with the spot
U||   just under your eye.”
U||   “We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner which
U||   distinguished him—“we are now close upon the Norwegian coast—in the
U||   sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the great province of Nordland—and
U||   in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit
U||   is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher—hold on
U||   to the grass if you feel giddy—so—and look out, beyond the belt of
U||   vapor beneath us, into the sea.”
U||   I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore
U||   so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer’s
U||   account of the Mare Tenebrarum. A panorama more deplorably desolate no
U||   human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the
U||   eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world,
U||   lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom
U||   was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up
U||   against its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever.
U||   Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a
U||   distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible a
U||   small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was
U||   discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.
U||   About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size,
U||   hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a
U||   cluster of dark rocks.
U||   The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant
U||   island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although, at
U||   the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the
U||   remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly
U||   plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like
U||   a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water
U||   in every direction—as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of
U||   foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.
U||   “The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by the
U||   Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the
U||   northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven,
U||   and Buckholm. Farther off—between Moskoe and Vurrgh—are Otterholm,
U||   Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the
U||   places—but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is
U||   more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you
U||   see any change in the water?”
U||   We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which
U||   we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no
U||   glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the
U||   old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound,
U||   like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie;
U||   and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping
U||   character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current
U||   which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a
U||   monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed—to its headlong
U||   impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was
U||   lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast
U||   that the main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters,
U||   seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly
U||   into phrensied convulsion—heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in
U||   gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to
U||   the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except
U||   in precipitous descents.
U||   In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical
U||   alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the
U||   whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam
U||   became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at
U||   length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into
U||   combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided
U||   vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.
U||   Suddenly—very suddenly—this assumed a distinct and definite existence,
U||   in a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was
U||   represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this
U||   slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far
U||   as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall
U||   of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five
U||   degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering
U||   motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek,
U||   half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts
U||   up in its agony to Heaven.
U||   The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw
U||   myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of
U||   nervous agitation.
U||   “This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this can be nothing else than
U||   the great whirlpool of the Maelström.”
U||   “So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it the
U||   Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.”
U||   The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for
U||   what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most
U||   circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of
U||   the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene—or of the wild
U||   bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder. I am not
U||   sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at
U||   what time; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen,
U||   nor during a storm. There are some passages of his description,
U||   nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their
U||   effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the
U||   spectacle.
U||   “Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the water is
U||   between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver
U||   (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage
U||   for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens
U||   even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the
U||   country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the
U||   roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest
U||   and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off,
U||   and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a
U||   ship comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried
U||   down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and
U||   when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But
U||   these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and
U||   flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its
U||   violence gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and
U||   its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway
U||   mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not
U||   guarding against it before they were within its reach. It likewise
U||   happens frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are
U||   overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to describe
U||   their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage
U||   themselves. A bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was
U||   caught by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to
U||   be heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being
U||   absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as
U||   if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of
U||   craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is
U||   regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea—it being constantly high
U||   and low water every six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning
U||   of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the
U||   very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.”
U||   In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could
U||   have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex.
U||   The “forty fathoms” must have reference only to portions of the channel
U||   close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the
U||   centre of the Moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater; and no better
U||   proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the
U||   sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the
U||   highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the
U||   howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity
U||   with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of
U||   belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to
U||   me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of the line in
U||   existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could
U||   resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear
U||   bodily and at once.
U||   The attempts to account for the phenomenon—some of which, I remember,
U||   seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal—now wore a very
U||   different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is
U||   that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands,
U||   “have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at
U||   flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines
U||   the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the
U||   higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural
U||   result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which
U||   is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.”—These are the words of
U||   the Encyclopædia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the
U||   centre of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss penetrating the
U||   globe, and issuing in some very remote part—the Gulf of Bothnia being
U||   somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself,
U||   was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented;
U||   and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say
U||   that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the
U||   subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the
U||   former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I
U||   agreed with him—for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether
U||   unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.
U||   “You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old man, “and if
U||   you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the
U||   roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I
U||   ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.”
U||   I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.
U||   “Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about
U||   seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among
U||   the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at
U||   sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the
U||   courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we
U||   three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to
U||   the islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower
U||   down to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much
U||   risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over
U||   here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but
U||   in far greater abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what
U||   the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week. In
U||   fact, we made it a matter of desperate speculation—the risk of life
U||   standing instead of labor, and courage answering for capital.
U||   “We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than
U||   this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of
U||   the fifteen minutes’ slack to push across the main channel of the
U||   Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage
U||   somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so
U||   violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for
U||   slack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out
U||   upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and
U||   coming—one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return—and we
U||   seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six years,
U||   we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm,
U||   which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to remain
U||   on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale which
U||   blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too boisterous
U||   to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been driven out to
U||   sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us round and
U||   round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged
U||   it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable
U||   cross currents—here to-day and gone to-morrow—which drove us under the
U||   lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.
U||   “I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we
U||   encountered ‘on the grounds’—it is a bad spot to be in, even in good
U||   weather—but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the
U||   Moskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart has
U||   been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before
U||   the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at
U||   starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while
U||   the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a
U||   son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would
U||   have been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as
U||   well as afterward in fishing—but, somehow, although we ran the risk
U||   ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the
U||   danger—for, after all is said and done, it was a horrible danger, and
U||   that is the truth.
U||   “It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to
U||   tell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18—, a day which
U||   the people of this part of the world will never forget—for it was one
U||   in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the
U||   heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the
U||   afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,
U||   while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could
U||   not have foreseen what was to follow.
U||   “The three of us—my two brothers and myself—had crossed over to the
U||   islands about two o’clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the smack
U||   with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than
U||   we had ever known them. It was just seven, by my watch, when we weighed
U||   and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström at slack
U||   water, which we knew would be at eight.
U||   “We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some
U||   time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for
U||   indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we
U||   were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most
U||   unusual—something that had never happened to us before—and I began to
U||   feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on
U||   the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was
U||   upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking
U||   astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored
U||   cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.
U||   “In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we
U||   were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of
U||   things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think
U||   about it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us—in less than two
U||   the sky was entirely overcast—and what with this and the driving spray,
U||   it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the
U||   smack.
U||   “Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The
U||   oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let
U||   our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first
U||   puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed
U||   off—the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed
U||   himself to it for safety.
U||   “Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.
U||   It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and
U||   this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to
U||   cross the Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But
U||   for this circumstance we should have foundered at once—for we lay
U||   entirely buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped
U||   destruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of
U||   ascertaining. For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I
U||   threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of
U||   the bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the
U||   fore-mast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this—which was
U||   undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done—for I was too much
U||   flurried to think.
U||   “For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this
U||   time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no
U||   longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands,
U||   and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself a
U||   shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid
U||   herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the
U||   better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so
U||   as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It
U||   was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure
U||   that he was overboard—but the next moment all this joy was turned into
U||   horror—for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word
U||   ‘Moskoe-ström!’
U||   “No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook
U||   from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I
U||   knew what he meant by that one word well enough—I knew what he wished
U||   to make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were
U||   bound for the whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!
U||   “You perceive that in crossing the Ström channel, we always went a long
U||   way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had to
U||   wait and watch carefully for the slack—but now we were driving right
U||   upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! ‘To be sure,’ I
U||   thought, ‘we shall get there just about the slack—there is some little
U||   hope in that’—but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great
U||   a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were
U||   doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.
U||   “By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or
U||   perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all
U||   events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay
U||   flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular
U||   change, too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it
U||   was still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all
U||   at once, a circular rift of clear sky—as clear as I ever saw—and of a
U||   deep bright blue—and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a
U||   lustre that I never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing
U||   about us with the greatest distinctness—but, oh God, what a scene it
U||   was to light up!
U||   “I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother—but, in some
U||   manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I
U||   could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top
U||   of my voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as
U||   death, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say ‘listen! ‘
U||   “At first I could not make out what he meant—but soon a hideous thought
U||   flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not going. I
U||   glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I
U||   flung it far away into the ocean. It had run down at seven o’clock! We
U||   were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Ström was in
U||   full fury!
U||   “When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the
U||   waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip
U||   from beneath her—which appears very strange to a landsman—and this is
U||   what is called riding, in sea phrase.
U||   “Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently a
U||   gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us
U||   with it as it rose—up—up—as if into the sky. I would not have believed
U||   that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came with a sweep, a
U||   slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was
U||   falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I
U||   had thrown a quick glance around—and that one glance was all
U||   sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-Ström
U||   whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead—but no more like the
U||   every-day Moskoe-Ström than the whirl as you now see it, is like a
U||   mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we had to expect,
U||   I should not have recognised the place at all. As it was, I
U||   involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched themselves
U||   together as if in a spasm.
U||   “It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we
U||   suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat
U||   made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new
U||   direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of
U||   the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek—such a
U||   sound as you might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many
U||   thousand steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were
U||   now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought,
U||   of course, that another moment would plunge us into the abyss, down
U||   which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity
U||   with which we wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the
U||   water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the
U||   surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose
U||   the world of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge writhing wall
U||   between us and the horizon.
U||   “It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the
U||   gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it.
U||   Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of
U||   that terror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that
U||   strung my nerves.
U||   “It may look like boasting—but what I tell you is truth—I began to
U||   reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how
U||   foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own
U||   individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God’s
U||   power. I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my
U||   mind. After a little while I became possessed with the keenest
U||   curiosity about the whirl itself. I positively felt a wish to explore
U||   its depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal
U||   grief was that I should never be able to tell my old companions on
U||   shore about the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular
U||   fancies to occupy a man’s mind in such extremity—and I have often
U||   thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might
U||   have rendered me a little light-headed.
U||   “There was another circumstance which tended to restore my
U||   self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could
U||   not reach us in our present situation—for, as you saw yourself, the
U||   belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean,
U||   and this latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge.
U||   If you have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of
U||   the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They
U||   blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of action or
U||   reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these
U||   annoyances—just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty
U||   indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.
U||   “How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say. We
U||   careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than
U||   floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge,
U||   and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I
U||   had never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at the stern, holding
U||   on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the
U||   coop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been
U||   swept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink
U||   of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from
U||   which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as
U||   it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt
U||   deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act—although I knew he
U||   was a madman when he did it—a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did
U||   not care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make
U||   no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have
U||   the bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great
U||   difficulty in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon
U||   an even keel—only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and
U||   swelters of the whirl. Scarcely had I secured myself in my new
U||   position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong
U||   into the abyss. I muttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was
U||   over.
U||   “As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively
U||   tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds
U||   I dared not open them—while I expected instant destruction, and
U||   wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water.
U||   But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling
U||   had ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been
U||   before, while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay
U||   more along. I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.
U||   “Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration
U||   with which I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by
U||   magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in
U||   circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides
U||   might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity
U||   with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance
U||   they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift
U||   amid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of
U||   golden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost
U||   recesses of the abyss.
U||   “At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately. The
U||   general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I
U||   recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively
U||   downward. In this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view,
U||   from the manner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the
U||   pool. She was quite upon an even keel—that is to say, her deck lay in a
U||   plane parallel with that of the water—but this latter sloped at an
U||   angle of more than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying
U||   upon our beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I
U||   had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this
U||   situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose,
U||   was owing to the speed at which we revolved.
U||   “The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound
U||   gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a
U||   thick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which
U||   there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge
U||   which Mussulmen say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This
U||   mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great
U||   walls of the funnel, as they all met together at the bottom—but the
U||   yell that went up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not
U||   attempt to describe.
U||   “Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above,
U||   had carried us a great distance down the slope; but our farther descent
U||   was by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept—not with any
U||   uniform movement—but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent us
U||   sometimes only a few hundred yards—sometimes nearly the complete
U||   circuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was
U||   slow, but very perceptible.
U||   “Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were
U||   thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the
U||   embrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments of
U||   vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with many
U||   smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes,
U||   barrels and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity
U||   which had taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow
U||   upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to
U||   watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our
U||   company. I must have been delirious, for I even sought amusement in
U||   speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents
U||   toward the foam below. ‘This fir tree,’ I found myself at one time
U||   saying, ‘will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge
U||   and disappears,’—and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of
U||   a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. At length,
U||   after making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in
U||   all—this fact—the fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a
U||   train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat
U||   heavily once more.
U||   “It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more
U||   exciting hope. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from
U||   present observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant
U||   matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and then
U||   thrown forth by the Moskoe-ström. By far the greater number of the
U||   articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way—so chafed and
U||   roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of
U||   splinters—but then I distinctly recollected that there were some of
U||   them which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this
U||   difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the
U||   only ones which had been completely absorbed—that the others had
U||   entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason,
U||   had descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the
U||   bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case
U||   might be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might
U||   thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing
U||   the fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed more
U||   rapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The first was,
U||   that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid
U||   their descent—the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the
U||   one spherical, and the other of any other shape, the superiority in
U||   speed of descent was with the sphere—the third, that, between two
U||   masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other
U||   shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my escape, I
U||   have had several conversations on this subject with an old
U||   school-master of the district; and it was from him that I learned the
U||   use of the words ‘cylinder’ and ‘sphere.’ He explained to me—although I
U||   have forgotten the explanation—how what I observed was, in fact, the
U||   natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments—and showed
U||   me how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more
U||   resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty
U||   than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)
U||   “There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in
U||   enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to
U||   account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something
U||   like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of
U||   these things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes
U||   upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and
U||   seemed to have moved but little from their original station.
U||   “I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely
U||   to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the
U||   counter, and to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my
U||   brother’s attention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came
U||   near us, and did everything in my power to make him understand what I
U||   was about to do. I thought at length that he comprehended my
U||   design—but, whether this was the case or not, he shook his head
U||   despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring-bolt. It
U||   was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and
U||   so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself
U||   to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter,
U||   and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another moment’s
U||   hesitation.
U||   “The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is myself
U||   who now tell you this tale—as you see that I did escape—and as you are
U||   already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected,
U||   and must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say—I will
U||   bring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or
U||   thereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a
U||   vast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid
U||   succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at
U||   once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I
U||   was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between
U||   the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before
U||   a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope
U||   of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.
U||   The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By
U||   degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the
U||   gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone
U||   down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I found
U||   myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores of
U||   Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-ström had
U||   been. It was the hour of the slack—but the sea still heaved in
U||   mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane. I was borne
U||   violently into the channel of the Ström, and in a few minutes was
U||   hurried down the coast into the ‘grounds’ of the fishermen. A boat
U||   picked me up—exhausted from fatigue—and (now that the danger was
U||   removed) speechless from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me on
U||   board were my old mates and daily companions—but they knew me no more
U||   than they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair
U||   which had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see it
U||   now. They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had
U||   changed. I told them my story—they did not believe it. I now tell it to
U||   you—and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the
U||   merry fishermen of Lofoden.”
U||VON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY
U||   After the very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of
U||   the summary in ‘Silliman’s Journal,’ with the detailed statement just
U||   published by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course, that
U||   in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen’s
U||   discovery, I have any design to look at the subject in a scientific
U||   point of view. My object is simply, in the first place, to say a few
U||   words of Von Kempelen himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the
U||   honor of a slight personal acquaintance), since every thing which
U||   concerns him must necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in
U||   the second place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the
U||   results of the discovery.
U||   It may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations which I
U||   have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be a general
U||   impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from the
U||   newspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionably
U||   is, is unanticipated.
U||   By reference to the ‘Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy’ (Cottle and Munroe,
U||   London, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that this
U||   illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question,
U||   but had actually made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in
U||   the very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by
U||   Von Kempelen, who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it,
U||   is, without doubt (I say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if
U||   required), indebted to the ‘Diary’ for at least the first hint of his
U||   own undertaking.
U||   The paragraph from the ‘Courier and Enquirer,’ which is now going the
U||   rounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for a
U||   Mr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a little
U||   apocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing either
U||   impossible or very improbable in the statement made. I need not go into
U||   details. My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its
U||   manner. It does not look true. Persons who are narrating facts, are
U||   seldom so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and
U||   precise location. Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the
U||   discovery he says he did, at the period designated—nearly eight years
U||   ago—how happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the
U||   immense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have
U||   resulted to him individually, if not to the world at large, from the
U||   discovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man of common
U||   understanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and
U||   yet have subsequently acted so like a baby—so like an owl—as Mr. Kissam
U||   admits that he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole
U||   paragraph in the ‘Courier and Enquirer’ a fabrication got up to ‘make a
U||   talk’? It must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air.
U||   Very little dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion;
U||   and if I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of
U||   science are mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry, I
U||   should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as
U||   Professor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam’s (or is it Mr. Quizzem’s?)
U||   pretensions to the discovery, in so serious a tone.
U||   But to return to the ‘Diary’ of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was
U||   not designed for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer,
U||   as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at
U||   once by the slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example,
U||   near the middle, we read, in reference to his researches about the
U||   protoxide of azote: ‘In less than half a minute the respiration being
U||   continued, diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to
U||   gentle pressure on all the muscles.’ That the respiration was not
U||   ‘diminished,’ is not only clear by the subsequent context, but by the
U||   use of the plural, ‘were.’ The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended:
U||   ‘In less than half a minute, the respiration [being continued, these
U||   feelings] diminished gradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation]
U||   analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles.’ A hundred similar
U||   instances go to show that the MS. so inconsiderately published, was
U||   merely a rough note-book, meant only for the writer’s own eye, but an
U||   inspection of the pamphlet will convince almost any thinking person of
U||   the truth of my suggestion. The fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about
U||   the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics. Not
U||   only had he a more than ordinary dislike to quackery, but he was
U||   morbidly afraid of appearing empirical; so that, however fully he might
U||   have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in
U||   question, he would never have spoken out, until he had every thing
U||   ready for the most practical demonstration. I verily believe that his
U||   last moments would have been rendered wretched, could he have suspected
U||   that his wishes in regard to burning this ‘Diary’ (full of crude
U||   speculations) would have been unattended to; as, it seems, they were. I
U||   say ‘his wishes,’ for that he meant to include this note-book among the
U||   miscellaneous papers directed ‘to be burnt,’ I think there can be no
U||   manner of doubt. Whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by
U||   bad, yet remains to be seen. That the passages quoted above, with the
U||   other similar ones referred to, gave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in
U||   the slightest degree question; but I repeat, it yet remains to be seen
U||   whether this momentous discovery itself (momentous under any
U||   circumstances) will be of service or disservice to mankind at large.
U||   That Von Kempelen and his immediate friends will reap a rich harvest,
U||   it would be folly to doubt for a moment. They will scarcely be so weak
U||   as not to ‘realize,’ in time, by large purchases of houses and land,
U||   with other property of intrinsic value.
U||   In the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the ‘Home
U||   Journal,’ and has since been extensively copied, several
U||   misapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by the
U||   translator, who professes to have taken the passage from a late number
U||   of the Presburg ‘Schnellpost.’ ‘Viele’ has evidently been misconceived
U||   (as it often is), and what the translator renders by ‘sorrows,’ is
U||   probably ‘lieden,’ which, in its true version, ‘sufferings,’ would give
U||   a totally different complexion to the whole account; but, of course,
U||   much of this is merely guess, on my part.
U||   Von Kempelen, however, is by no means ‘a misanthrope,’ in appearance,
U||   at least, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance with him was
U||   casual altogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know
U||   him at all; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious
U||   a notoriety as he has attained, or will attain in a few days, is not a
U||   small matter, as times go.
U||   “The Literary World” speaks of him, confidently, as a native of
U||   Presburg (misled, perhaps, by the account in “The Home Journal”) but I
U||   am pleased in being able to state positively, since I have it from his
U||   own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although
U||   both his parents, I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is
U||   connected, in some way, with Mäelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory.
U||   In person, he is short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy
U||   hair and whiskers, a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a
U||   Roman nose. There is some defect in one of his feet. His address is
U||   frank, and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he
U||   looks, speaks, and acts as little like ‘a misanthrope’ as any man I
U||   ever saw. We were fellow-sojourners for a week about six years ago, at
U||   Earl’s Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I
U||   conversed with him, at various times, for some three or four hours
U||   altogether. His principal topics were those of the day; and nothing
U||   that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments. He
U||   left the hotel before me, intending to go to New York, and thence to
U||   Bremen; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first
U||   made public; or, rather, it was there that he was first suspected of
U||   having made it. This is about all that I personally know of the now
U||   immortal Von Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details
U||   would have interest for the public.
U||   There can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat
U||   about this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much credit
U||   as the story of Aladdin’s lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as in
U||   the case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truth
U||   may be stranger than fiction. The following anecdote, at least, is so
U||   well authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly.
U||   Von Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his
U||   residence at Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to
U||   extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums. When the great
U||   excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth & Co.,
U||   suspicion was directed toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having
U||   purchased a considerable property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing,
U||   when questioned, to explain how he became possessed of the purchase
U||   money. He was at length arrested, but nothing decisive appearing
U||   against him, was in the end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a
U||   strict watch upon his movements, and thus discovered that he left home
U||   frequently, taking always the same road, and invariably giving his
U||   watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and
U||   crooked passages known by the flash name of the ‘Dondergat.’ Finally,
U||   by dint of great perseverance, they traced him to a garret in an old
U||   house of seven stories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,—and, coming upon
U||   him suddenly, found him, as they imagined, in the midst of his
U||   counterfeiting operations. His agitation is represented as so excessive
U||   that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After
U||   hand-cuffing him, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it
U||   appears he occupied all the mansarde.
U||   Opening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet
U||   by eight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object
U||   has not yet been ascertained. In one corner of the closet was a very
U||   small furnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of
U||   duplicate crucible—two crucibles connected by a tube. One of these
U||   crucibles was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not
U||   reaching up to the aperture of the tube, which was close to the brim.
U||   The other crucible had some liquid in it, which, as the officers
U||   entered, seemed to be furiously dissipating in vapor. They relate that,
U||   on finding himself taken, Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands
U||   (which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be
U||   asbestic), and threw the contents on the tiled floor. It was now that
U||   they hand-cuffed him; and before proceeding to ransack the premises
U||   they searched his person, but nothing unusual was found about him,
U||   excepting a paper parcel, in his coat-pocket, containing what was
U||   afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown
U||   substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal proportions. All attempts at
U||   analyzing the unknown substance have, so far, failed, but that it will
U||   ultimately be analyzed, is not to be doubted.
U||   Passing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went
U||   through a sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to
U||   the chemist’s sleeping-room. They here rummaged some drawers and boxes,
U||   but discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin,
U||   silver and gold. At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large,
U||   common hair trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top
U||   lying carelessly across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw
U||   this trunk out from under the bed, they found that, with their united
U||   strength (there were three of them, all powerful men), they ‘could not
U||   stir it one inch.’ Much astonished at this, one of them crawled under
U||   the bed, and looking into the trunk, said:
U||   ‘No wonder we couldn’t move it—why it’s full to the brim of old bits of
U||   brass!’
U||   Putting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase,
U||   and pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with all
U||   theirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under the
U||   bed, and its contents examined. The supposed brass with which it was
U||   filled was all in small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a pea
U||   to that of a dollar; but the pieces were irregular in shape, although
U||   more or less flat-looking, upon the whole, “very much as lead looks
U||   when thrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to
U||   grow cool.” Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected this
U||   metal to be anything but brass. The idea of its being gold never
U||   entered their brains, of course; how could such a wild fancy have
U||   entered it? And their astonishment may be well conceived, when the next
U||   day it became known, all over Bremen, that the “lot of brass” which
U||   they had carted so contemptuously to the police office, without putting
U||   themselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only
U||   gold—real gold—but gold far finer than any employed in coinage—gold, in
U||   fact, absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable alloy.
U||   I need not go over the details of Von Kempelen’s confession (as far as
U||   it went) and release, for these are familiar to the public. That he has
U||   actually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, the
U||   old chimaera of the philosopher’s stone, no sane person is at liberty
U||   to doubt. The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the
U||   greatest consideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he
U||   says of bismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken cum grano
U||   salis. The simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has
U||   failed; and until Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his
U||   own published enigma, it is more than probable that the matter will
U||   remain, for years, in statu quo. All that as yet can fairly be said to
U||   be known is, that ‘Pure gold can be made at will, and very readily from
U||   lead in connection with certain other substances, in kind and in
U||   proportions, unknown.’
U||   Speculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate
U||   results of this discovery—a discovery which few thinking persons will
U||   hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold
U||   generally, by the late developments in California; and this reflection
U||   brings us inevitably to another—the exceeding inopportuneness of Von
U||   Kempelen’s analysis. If many were prevented from adventuring to
U||   California, by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially
U||   diminish in value, on account of its plentifulness in the mines there,
U||   as to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful
U||   one—what impression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about
U||   to emigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the
U||   mineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery of Von
U||   Kempelen? a discovery which declares, in so many words, that beyond its
U||   intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may
U||   be), gold now is, or at least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed
U||   that Von Kempelen can long retain his secret), of no greater value than
U||   lead, and of far inferior value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly
U||   difficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the
U||   discovery, but one thing may be positively maintained—that the
U||   announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material
U||   influence in regard to the settlement of California.
U||   In Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of two
U||   hundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly twenty-five per
U||   cent. that of silver.
U||MESMERIC REVELATION
U||   Whatever doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism, its
U||   startling facts are now almost universally admitted. Of these latter,
U||   those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession—an unprofitable
U||   and disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste of time
U||   than the attempt to prove, at the present day, that man, by mere
U||   exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an
U||   abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those
U||   of death, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the
U||   phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,
U||   while in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,
U||   and then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with
U||   keenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,
U||   matters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his
U||   intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that
U||   his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and,
U||   finally, that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its
U||   frequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena
U||   elicited are more extended and more pronounced.
U||   I say that these—which are the laws of mesmerism in its general
U||   features—it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict
U||   upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose at
U||   present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in the
U||   teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very
U||   remarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and
U||   myself.
U||   I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question (Mr.
U||   Vankirk), and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the
U||   mesmeric perception had supervened. For many months he had been
U||   laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects of
U||   which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of
U||   Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.
U||   The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart,
U||   and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of
U||   asthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the
U||   application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night this had
U||   been attempted in vain.
U||   As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and although
U||   evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease.
U||   “I sent for you to-night,” he said, “not so much to administer to my
U||   bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions
U||   which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise. I need
U||   not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the topic of the
U||   soul’s immortality. I cannot deny that there has always existed, as if
U||   in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague half-sentiment of
U||   its own existence. But this half-sentiment at no time amounted to
U||   conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do. All attempts at
U||   logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more sceptical than
U||   before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own
U||   works as well as in those of his European and American echoes. The
U||   ‘Charles Elwood’ of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed in my hands.
U||   I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it logical, but
U||   the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial
U||   arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his summing up it
U||   seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeeded in
U||   convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his beginning, like
U||   the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in perceiving that
U||   if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he
U||   will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions which have been so
U||   long the fashion of the moralists of England, of France, and of
U||   Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no hold on the
U||   mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded, will
U||   always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The will
U||   may assent—the soul—the intellect, never.
U||   “I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually
U||   believed. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the
U||   feeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of
U||   reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am
U||   enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence. I
U||   cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the
U||   mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination
U||   which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full
U||   accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through
U||   its effect, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning
U||   and its conclusion—the cause and its effect—are present together. In my
U||   natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only
U||   partially, remains.
U||   “These considerations have led me to think that some good results might
U||   ensue from a series of well-directed questions propounded to me while
U||   mesmerized. You have often observed the profound self-cognizance
U||   evinced by the sleep-waker—the extensive knowledge he displays upon all
U||   points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and from this
U||   self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a
U||   catechism.”
U||   I consented of course to make this experiment. A few passes threw Mr.
U||   Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became immediately more
U||   easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness. The following
U||   conversation then ensued:—V. in the dialogue representing the patient,
U||   and P. myself.
U||   P. Are you asleep?
U||   V. Yes—no; I would rather sleep more soundly.
U||   P. [After a few more passes.] Do you sleep now?
U||   V. Yes.
U||   P. How do you think your present illness will result?
U||   V. [After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort.] I must
U||   die.
U||   P. Does the idea of death afflict you?
U||   V. [Very quickly.] No—no!
U||   P. Are you pleased with the prospect?
U||   V. If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter. The
U||   mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.
U||   P. I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.
U||   V. I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel able
U||   to make. You do not question me properly.
U||   P. What then shall I ask?
U||   V. You must begin at the beginning.
U||   P. The beginning! But where is the beginning?
U||   V. You know that the beginning is GOD. [This was said in a low,
U||   fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration.]
U||   P. What then, is God?
U||   V. [Hesitating for many minutes.] I cannot tell.
U||   P. Is not God spirit?
U||   V. While I was awake I knew what you meant by “spirit,” but now it
U||   seems only a word—such, for instance, as truth, beauty—a quality, I
U||   mean.
U||   P. Is not God immaterial?
U||   V. There is no immateriality—it is a mere word. That which is not
U||   matter, is not at all—unless qualities are things.
U||   P. Is God, then, material?
U||   V. No. [This reply startled me very much.]
U||   P. What, then, is he?
U||   V. [After a long pause, and mutteringly.] I see—but it is a thing
U||   difficult to tell. [Another long pause.] He is not spirit, for he
U||   exists. Nor is he matter, as you understand it. But there are
U||   gradations of matter of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling
U||   the finer, the finer pervading the grosser. The atmosphere, for
U||   example, impels the electric principle, while the electric principle
U||   permeates the atmosphere. These gradations of matter increase in rarity
U||   or fineness, until we arrive at a matter unparticled—without
U||   particles—indivisible—one; and here the law of impulsion and permeation
U||   is modified. The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only permeates
U||   all things but impels all things; and thus is all things within itself.
U||   This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in the word “thought,”
U||   is this matter in motion.
U||   P. The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion
U||   and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.
U||   V. Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the action of
U||   mind, not of thinking. The unparticled matter, or God, in quiescence,
U||   is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind. And the power
U||   of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is, in the
U||   unparticled matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence; how I
U||   know not, and now clearly see that I shall never know. But the
U||   unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or quality, existing within
U||   itself, is thinking.
U||   P. Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the
U||   unparticled matter?
U||   V. The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in
U||   gradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of
U||   water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous
U||   ether. Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in
U||   one general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas
U||   more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and
U||   that which we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach the
U||   latter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with
U||   spirit, or with nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is
U||   our conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to
U||   seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in
U||   infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the idea of
U||   the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the
U||   ether as an entity, or at least as matter. For want of a better word we
U||   might term it spirit. Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous
U||   ether—conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether
U||   is more rare than the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the
U||   school dogmas) at a unique mass—an unparticled matter. For although we
U||   may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude
U||   of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity. There will be
U||   a point—there will be a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms are
U||   sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must vanish, and the mass
U||   absolutely coalesce. But the consideration of the atomic constitution
U||   being now taken away, the nature of the mass inevitably glides into
U||   what we conceive of spirit. It is clear, however, that it is as fully
U||   matter as before. The truth is, it is impossible to conceive spirit,
U||   since it is impossible to imagine what is not. When we flatter
U||   ourselves that we have formed its conception, we have merely deceived
U||   our understanding by the consideration of infinitely rarified matter.
U||   P. There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of
U||   absolute coalescence;—and that is the very slight resistance
U||   experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space—a
U||   resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in some degree, but
U||   which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by
U||   the sagacity even of Newton. We know that the resistance of bodies is,
U||   chiefly, in proportion to their density. Absolute coalescence is
U||   absolute density. Where there are no interspaces, there can be no
U||   yielding. An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more
U||   effectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant
U||   or of iron.
U||   V. Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio
U||   of its apparent unanswerability.—As regards the progress of the star,
U||   it can make no difference whether the star passes through the ether or
U||   the ether through it. There is no astronomical error more unaccountable
U||   than that which reconciles the known retardation of the comets with the
U||   idea of their passage through an ether: for, however rare this ether be
U||   supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal revolution in a very far
U||   briefer period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have
U||   endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to
U||   comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand,
U||   about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in
U||   the instantaneous passage through the orb. In the one case, the
U||   retarding force is momentary and complete within itself—in the other it
U||   is endlessly accumulative.
U||   P. But in all this—in this identification of mere matter with God—is
U||   there nothing of irreverence? [I was forced to repeat this question
U||   before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning.]
U||   V. Can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind? But you
U||   forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, the very
U||   “mind” or “spirit” of the schools, so far as regards its high
U||   capacities, and is, moreover, the “matter” of these schools at the same
U||   time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the
U||   perfection of matter.
U||   P. You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is
U||   thought?
U||   V. In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universal
U||   mind. This thought creates. All created things are but the thoughts of
U||   God.
U||   P. You say, “in general.”
U||   V. Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities, matter is
U||   necessary.
U||   P. But you now speak of “mind” and “matter” as do the metaphysicians.
U||   V. Yes—to avoid confusion. When I say “mind,” I mean the unparticled or
U||   ultimate matter; by “matter,” I intend all else.
U||   P. You were saying that “for new individualities matter is necessary.”
U||   V. Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To create
U||   individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions of
U||   the divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested of corporate
U||   investiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion of the incarnated
U||   portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motion
U||   of the whole is that of God.
U||   P. You say that divested of the body man will be God?
U||   V. [After much hesitation.] I could not have said this; it is an
U||   absurdity.
U||   P. [Referring to my notes.] You did say that “divested of corporate
U||   investiture man were God.”
U||   V. And this is true. Man thus divested would be God—would be
U||   unindividualized. But he can never be thus divested—at least never will
U||   be—else we must imagine an action of God returning upon itself—a
U||   purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature. Creatures are
U||   thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.
U||   P. I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the body?
U||   V. I say that he will never be bodiless.
U||   P. Explain.
U||   V. There are two bodies—the rudimental and the complete; corresponding
U||   with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly. What we call
U||   “death,” is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present incarnation is
U||   progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is perfected, ultimate,
U||   immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.
U||   P. But of the worm’s metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.
U||   V. We, certainly—but not the worm. The matter of which our rudimental
U||   body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that body; or,
U||   more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of
U||   which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which the
U||   ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental
U||   senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from
U||   the inner form; not that inner form itself; but this inner form, as
U||   well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired
U||   the ultimate life.
U||   P. You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles
U||   death. How is this?
U||   V. When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the
U||   ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life
U||   are in abeyance, and I perceive external things directly, without
U||   organs, through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate,
U||   unorganized life.
U||   P. Unorganized?
U||   V. Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into
U||   sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to the
U||   exclusion of other classes and forms. The organs of man are adapted to
U||   his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition,
U||   being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but
U||   one—the nature of the volition of God—that is to say, the motion of the
U||   unparticled matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate body
U||   by conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is not; but a conception
U||   of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it is. A
U||   luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether. The
U||   vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again
U||   communicate similar ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar
U||   ones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled
U||   matter which permeates it. The motion of this latter is thought, of
U||   which perception is the first undulation. This is the mode by which the
U||   mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and
U||   this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the
U||   idiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the
U||   external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having
U||   affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than
U||   that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to
U||   this ether—in unison with it—the whole body vibrates, setting in motion
U||   the unparticled matter which permeates it. It is to the absence of
U||   idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly
U||   unlimited perception of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs
U||   are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.
U||   P. You speak of rudimental “beings.” Are there other rudimental
U||   thinking beings than man?
U||   V. The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulæ,
U||   planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulæ, suns, nor
U||   planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying pabulum for the
U||   idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings. But for
U||   the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there
U||   would have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is tenanted by a
U||   distinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all,
U||   the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death, or
U||   metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate
U||   life—immortality—and cognizant of all secrets but the one, act all
U||   things and pass everywhere by mere volition:—indwelling, not the stars,
U||   which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation of
U||   which we blindly deem space created—but that SPACE itself—that infinity
U||   of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the
U||   star-shadows—blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of
U||   the angels.
U||   P. You say that “but for the necessity of the rudimental life” there
U||   would have been no stars. But why this necessity?
U||   V. In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter generally,
U||   there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law—the
U||   Divine Volition. With the view of producing impediment, the organic
U||   life and matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,) were
U||   contrived.
U||   P. But again—why need this impediment have been produced?
U||   V. The result of law inviolate is perfection—right—negative happiness.
U||   The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive pain.
U||   Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and
U||   substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of
U||   law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which in
U||   the inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.
U||   P. But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?
U||   V. All things are either good or bad by comparison. A sufficient
U||   analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of
U||   pain. Positive pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one point we
U||   must have suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been never
U||   to have been blessed. But it has been shown that, in the inorganic
U||   life, pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic. The pain of
U||   the primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the
U||   ultimate life in Heaven.
U||   P. Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible
U||   to comprehend—“the truly substantive vastness of infinity.”
U||   V. This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic
U||   conception of the term “substance” itself. We must not regard it as a
U||   quality, but as a sentiment:—it is the perception, in thinking beings,
U||   of the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many
U||   things on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of
U||   Venus—many things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be
U||   brought to appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic
U||   beings—to the angels—the whole of the unparticled matter is
U||   substance—that is to say, the whole of what we term “space” is to them
U||   the truest substantiality;—the stars, meantime, through what we
U||   consider their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in
U||   proportion as the unparticled matter, through what we consider its
U||   immateriality, eludes the organic.
U||   As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone, I
U||   observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat
U||   alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. No sooner had I done
U||   this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell
U||   back upon his pillow and expired. I noticed that in less than a minute
U||   afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone. His brow was
U||   of the coldness of ice. Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only
U||   after long pressure from Azrael’s hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed,
U||   during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out
U||   the region of the shadows?
U||THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR
U||   Of course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder,
U||   that the extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It
U||   would have been a miracle had it not—especially under the
U||   circumstances. Through the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the
U||   affair from the public, at least for the present, or until we had
U||   farther opportunities for investigation—through our endeavors to effect
U||   this—a garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society, and
U||   became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations; and, very
U||   naturally, of a great deal of disbelief.
U||   It is now rendered necessary that I give the facts—as far as I
U||   comprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:
U||   My attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to
U||   the subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it occurred to me,
U||   quite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there
U||   had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission:—no person
U||   had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen,
U||   first, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any
U||   susceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any
U||   existed, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to
U||   what extent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might
U||   be arrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained,
U||   but these most excited my curiosity—the last in especial, from the
U||   immensely important character of its consequences.
U||   In looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these
U||   particulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar,
U||   the well-known compiler of the “Bibliotheca Forensica,” and author
U||   (under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of
U||   “Wallenstein” and “Gargantua.” M. Valdemar, who has resided principally
U||   at Harlem, N.Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly
U||   noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person—his lower limbs much
U||   resembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his
U||   whiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair—the latter,
U||   in consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His
U||   temperament was markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for
U||   mesmeric experiment. On two or three occasions I had put him to sleep
U||   with little difficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his
U||   peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate. His will was
U||   at no period positively, or thoroughly, under my control, and in regard
U||   to clairvoyance, I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon.
U||   I always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state
U||   of his health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with
U||   him, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was
U||   his custom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution, as
U||   of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted.
U||   When the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was of
U||   course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew the
U||   steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from
U||   him; and he had no relatives in America who would be likely to
U||   interfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and, to my
U||   surprise, his interest seemed vividly excited. I say to my surprise,
U||   for, although he had always yielded his person freely to my
U||   experiments, he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with
U||   what I did. His disease was of that character which would admit of
U||   exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death;
U||   and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about
U||   twenty-four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that
U||   of his decease.
U||   It is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M.
U||   Valdemar himself, the subjoined note:
U||   MY DEAR P——,
U||   You may as well come now. D—— and F—— are agreed that I cannot hold out
U||   beyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very
U||   nearly.
U||   VALDEMAR
U||   I received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in
U||   fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man’s chamber. I had not seen
U||   him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the
U||   brief interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes
U||   were utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme that the
U||   skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was
U||   excessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless,
U||   in a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree
U||   of physical strength. He spoke with distinctness—took some palliative
U||   medicines without aid—and, when I entered the room, was occupied in
U||   penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by
U||   pillows. Doctors D—— and F—— were in attendance.
U||   After pressing Valdemar’s hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and
U||   obtained from them a minute account of the patient’s condition. The
U||   left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or
U||   cartilaginous state, and was, of course, entirely useless for all
U||   purposes of vitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also
U||   partially, if not thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region was
U||   merely a mass of purulent tubercles, running one into another. Several
U||   extensive perforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion
U||   to the ribs had taken place. These appearances in the right lobe were
U||   of comparatively recent date. The ossification had proceeded with very
U||   unusual rapidity; no sign of it had been discovered a month before, and
U||   the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days.
U||   Independently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism of
U||   the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact
U||   diagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physicians that M.
U||   Valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday). It was then
U||   seven o’clock on Saturday evening.
U||   On quitting the invalid’s bed-side to hold conversation with myself,
U||   Doctors D—— and F—— had bidden him a final farewell. It had not been
U||   their intention to return; but, at my request, they agreed to look in
U||   upon the patient about ten the next night.
U||   When they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subject of
U||   his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the
U||   experiment proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and even
U||   anxious to have it made, and urged me to commence it at once. A male
U||   and a female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself
U||   altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no
U||   more reliable witnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident,
U||   might prove. I therefore postponed operations until about eight the
U||   next night, when the arrival of a medical student with whom I had some
U||   acquaintance, (Mr. Theodore L—l,) relieved me from farther
U||   embarrassment. It had been my design, originally, to wait for the
U||   physicians; but I was induced to proceed, first, by the urgent
U||   entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly, by my conviction that I had
U||   not a moment to lose, as he was evidently sinking fast.
U||   Mr. L—l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes
U||   of all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that what I now have
U||   to relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.
U||   It wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient’s hand,
U||   I begged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L—l, whether
U||   he (M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment
U||   of mesmerizing him in his then condition.
U||   He replied feebly, yet quite audibly, “Yes, I wish to be. I fear you
U||   have mesmerized”—adding immediately afterwards: “I fear you have
U||   deferred it too long.”
U||   While he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found
U||   most effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with the
U||   first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I
U||   exerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect was induced until
U||   some minutes after ten o’clock, when Doctors D—— and F—— called,
U||   according to appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what I
U||   designed, and as they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was
U||   already in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation—exchanging,
U||   however, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze
U||   entirely into the right eye of the sufferer.
U||   By this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was
U||   stertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.
U||   This condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At the
U||   expiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deep sigh
U||   escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathing
U||   ceased—that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; the
U||   intervals were undiminished. The patient’s extremities were of an icy
U||   coldness.
U||   At five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of the
U||   mesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed for that
U||   expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in
U||   cases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake.
U||   With a few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipient
U||   sleep, and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was not
U||   satisfied, however, with this, but continued the manipulations
U||   vigorously, and with the fullest exertion of the will, until I had
U||   completely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer, after placing them in
U||   a seemingly easy position. The legs were at full length; the arms were
U||   nearly so, and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin.
U||   The head was very slightly elevated.
U||   When I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested
U||   the gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar’s condition. After a few
U||   experiments, they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of
U||   mesmeric trance. The curiosity of both the physicians was greatly
U||   excited. Dr. D—— resolved at once to remain with the patient all night,
U||   while Dr. F—— took leave with a promise to return at daybreak. Mr. L—l
U||   and the nurses remained.
U||   We left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o’clock in
U||   the morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same
U||   condition as when Dr. F—— went away—that is to say, he lay in the same
U||   position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle
U||   (scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the
U||   lips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and
U||   as cold as marble. Still, the general appearance was certainly not that
U||   of death.
U||   As I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence
U||   his right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently to
U||   and fro above his person. In such experiments with this patient, I had
U||   never perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of
U||   succeeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although
U||   feebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined
U||   to hazard a few words of conversation.
U||   “M. Valdemar,” I said, “are you asleep?” He made no answer, but I
U||   perceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the
U||   question, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole frame was
U||   agitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so
U||   far as to display a white line of the ball; the lips moved sluggishly,
U||   and from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:
U||   “Yes;—asleep now. Do not wake me!—let me die so!”
U||   I here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm,
U||   as before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the
U||   sleep-waker again:
U||   “Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?”
U||   The answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before:
U||   “No pain—I am dying.”
U||   I did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and
U||   nothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F——, who came a
U||   little before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding
U||   the patient still alive. After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror
U||   to the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again. I did
U||   so, saying:
U||   “M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?”
U||   As before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the
U||   interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.
U||   At my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almost
U||   inaudibly:
U||   “Yes; still asleep—dying.”
U||   It was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that M.
U||   Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present
U||   apparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene—and this,
U||   it was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes. I
U||   concluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my
U||   previous question.
U||   While I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of the
U||   sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils
U||   disappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue,
U||   resembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular
U||   hectic spots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre
U||   of each cheek, went out at once. I use this expression, because the
U||   suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the
U||   extinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip, at
U||   the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had
U||   previously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible
U||   jerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view
U||   the swollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the party
U||   then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous
U||   beyond conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment,
U||   that there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed.
U||   I now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every
U||   reader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business,
U||   however, simply to proceed.
U||   There was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and
U||   concluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the
U||   nurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue.
U||   This continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration of this period,
U||   there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice—such as it
U||   would be madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or
U||   three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I
U||   might say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and
U||   hollow; but the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason
U||   that no similar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There
U||   were two particulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still
U||   think, might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation—as
U||   well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the
U||   first place, the voice seemed to reach our ears—at least mine—from a
U||   vast distance, or from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second
U||   place, it impressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to
U||   make myself comprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress
U||   the sense of touch.
U||   I have spoken both of “sound” and of “voice.” I mean to say that the
U||   sound was one of distinct—of even wonderfully, thrillingly
U||   distinct—syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke—obviously in reply to the
U||   question I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had asked him,
U||   it will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:
U||   “Yes;—no;—I have been sleeping—and now—now—I am dead.”
U||   No person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the
U||   unutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered,
U||   were so well calculated to convey. Mr. L—l (the student) swooned. The
U||   nurses immediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to
U||   return. My own impressions I would not pretend to render intelligible
U||   to the reader. For nearly an hour, we busied ourselves,
U||   silently—without the utterance of a word—in endeavors to revive Mr.
U||   L—l. When he came to himself, we addressed ourselves again to an
U||   investigation of M. Valdemar’s condition.
U||   It remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the
U||   exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration.
U||   An attempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should mention, too,
U||   that this limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain
U||   to make it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication,
U||   indeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory
U||   movement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question. He
U||   seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient
U||   volition. To queries put to him by any other person than myself he
U||   seemed utterly insensible—although I endeavored to place each member of
U||   the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have now
U||   related all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker’s
U||   state at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and at ten o’clock I
U||   left the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L—l.
U||   In the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His condition
U||   remained precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to the
U||   propriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little
U||   difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so
U||   doing. It was evident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed
U||   death) had been arrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us
U||   all that to awaken M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant,
U||   or at least his speedy, dissolution.
U||   From this period until the close of last week—an interval of nearly
U||   seven months—we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar’s house,
U||   accompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends. All this time
U||   the sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him. The
U||   nurses’ attentions were continual.
U||   It was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment
U||   of awakening, or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps)
U||   unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so
U||   much discussion in private circles—to so much of what I cannot help
U||   thinking unwarranted popular feeling.
U||   For the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I
U||   made use of the customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful.
U||   The first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of
U||   the iris. It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering
U||   of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish
U||   ichor (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.
U||   It was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient’s
U||   arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F—— then
U||   intimated a desire to have me put a question. I did so, as follows:
U||   “M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes
U||   now?”
U||   There was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; the
U||   tongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although the
U||   jaws and lips remained rigid as before), and at length the same hideous
U||   voice which I have already described, broke forth:
U||   “For God’s sake!—quick!—quick!—put me to sleep—or, quick!—waken
U||   me!—quick!—I say to you that I am dead!”
U||   I was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what
U||   to do. At first I made an endeavor to recompose the patient; but,
U||   failing in this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps
U||   and as earnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt I soon saw
U||   that I should be successful—or at least I soon fancied that my success
U||   would be complete—and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to
U||   see the patient awaken.
U||   For what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any
U||   human being could have been prepared.
U||   As I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of “dead!
U||   dead!” absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the
U||   sufferer, his whole frame at once—within the space of a single minute,
U||   or even less, shrunk—crumbled—absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.
U||   Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass
U||   of loathsome—of detestable putrescence.
U||THE BLACK CAT.
U||   For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I
U||   neither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it,
U||   in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I
U||   not—and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day I
U||   would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before the
U||   world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of mere
U||   household events. In their consequences, these events have
U||   terrified—have tortured—have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to
U||   expound them. To me, they have presented little but horror—to many they
U||   will seem less terrible than barroques. Hereafter, perhaps, some
U||   intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the
U||   common-place—some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less
U||   excitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I
U||   detail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very
U||   natural causes and effects.
U||   From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my
U||   disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make
U||   me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was
U||   indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent
U||   most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing
U||   them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my
U||   manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To
U||   those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog,
U||   I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the
U||   intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in
U||   the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly
U||   to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry
U||   friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.
U||   I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not
U||   uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she
U||   lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We
U||   had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a cat.
U||   This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely
U||   black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his
U||   intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with
U||   superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion,
U||   which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was
U||   ever serious upon this point—and I mention the matter at all for no
U||   better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.
U||   Pluto—this was the cat’s name—was my favorite pet and playmate. I alone
U||   fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It was
U||   even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through
U||   the streets.
U||   Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which
U||   my general temperament and character—through the instrumentality of the
U||   Fiend Intemperance—had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical
U||   alteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more
U||   irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself
U||   to use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her
U||   personal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change in
U||   my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For Pluto,
U||   however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from
U||   maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the
U||   monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they
U||   came in my way. But my disease grew upon me—for what disease is like
U||   Alcohol!—and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and
U||   consequently somewhat peevish—even Pluto began to experience the
U||   effects of my ill temper.
U||   One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts
U||   about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him;
U||   when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my
U||   hand with his teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew
U||   myself no longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight
U||   from my body and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured,
U||   thrilled every fibre of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a
U||   pen-knife, opened it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and
U||   deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I
U||   shudder, while I pen the damnable atrocity.
U||   When reason returned with the morning—when I had slept off the fumes of
U||   the night’s debauch—I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of
U||   remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best,
U||   a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I
U||   again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the
U||   deed.
U||   In the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye
U||   presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer
U||   appeared to suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as
U||   might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much
U||   of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike
U||   on the part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling
U||   soon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and
U||   irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit
U||   philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives,
U||   than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the
U||   human heart—one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments,
U||   which give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred
U||   times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other
U||   reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual
U||   inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which
U||   is Law, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit of
U||   perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this
U||   unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself—to offer violence to its
U||   own nature—to do wrong for the wrong’s sake only—that urged me to
U||   continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the
U||   unoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about
U||   its neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;—hung it with the tears
U||   streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my
U||   heart;—hung it because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt
U||   it had given me no reason of offence;—hung it because I knew that in so
U||   doing I was committing a sin—a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my
U||   immortal soul as to place it—if such a thing wore possible—even beyond
U||   the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most Merciful and Most Terrible
U||   God.
U||   On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was
U||   aroused from sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in
U||   flames. The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that
U||   my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration.
U||   The destruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed
U||   up, and I resigned myself thenceforward to despair.
U||   I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and
U||   effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a
U||   chain of facts—and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On
U||   the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with one
U||   exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment
U||   wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and
U||   against which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here,
U||   in great measure, resisted the action of the fire—a fact which I
U||   attributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a dense
U||   crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a
U||   particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The
U||   words “strange!” “singular!” and other similar expressions, excited my
U||   curiosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in bas relief upon the
U||   white surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. The impression was given
U||   with an accuracy truly marvellous. There was a rope about the animal’s
U||   neck.
U||   When I first beheld this apparition—for I could scarcely regard it as
U||   less—my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection
U||   came to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden
U||   adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been
U||   immediately filled by the crowd—by some one of whom the animal must
U||   have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my
U||   chamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me from
U||   sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my
U||   cruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of
U||   which, with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, had then
U||   accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.
U||   Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my
U||   conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less
U||   fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not
U||   rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there
U||   came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not,
U||   remorse. I went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look
U||   about me, among the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for
U||   another pet of the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance,
U||   with which to supply its place.
U||   One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, my
U||   attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon the
U||   head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or of rum, which
U||   constituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking
U||   steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now
U||   caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the
U||   object thereupon. I approached it, and touched it with my hand. It was
U||   a black cat—a very large one—fully as large as Pluto, and closely
U||   resembling him in every respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair
U||   upon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although
U||   indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the
U||   breast. Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly,
U||   rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This,
U||   then, was the very creature of which I was in search. I at once offered
U||   to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no claim to
U||   it—knew nothing of it—had never seen it before.
U||   I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal
U||   evinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so;
U||   occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached
U||   the house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a
U||   great favorite with my wife.
U||   For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This
U||   was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but—I know not how or
U||   why it was—its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and
U||   annoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose
U||   into the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense
U||   of shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing
U||   me from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or
U||   otherwise violently ill use it; but gradually—very gradually—I came to
U||   look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its
U||   odious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.
U||   What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on
U||   the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been
U||   deprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared
U||   it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high
U||   degree, that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing
U||   trait, and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.
U||   With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed
U||   to increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would
U||   be difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it would
U||   crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its
U||   loathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and
U||   thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my
U||   dress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although I
U||   longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing,
U||   partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly—let me confess it at
U||   once—by absolute dread of the beast.
U||   This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil—and yet I should be
U||   at a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own—yes,
U||   even in this felon’s cell, I am almost ashamed to own—that the terror
U||   and horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by
U||   one of the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife
U||   had called my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark
U||   of white hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole
U||   visible difference between the strange beast and the one I had
U||   destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had
U||   been originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees—degrees nearly
U||   imperceptible, and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject
U||   as fanciful—it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of
U||   outline. It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to
U||   name—and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have
U||   rid myself of the monster had I dared—it was now, I say, the image of a
U||   hideous—of a ghastly thing—of the GALLOWS!—oh, mournful and terrible
U||   engine of Horror and of Crime—of Agony and of Death!
U||   And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.
U||   And a brute beast —whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed—a brute
U||   beast to work out for me—for me a man, fashioned in the image of the
U||   High God—so much of insufferable woe! Alas! neither by day nor by night
U||   knew I the blessing of rest any more! During the former the creature
U||   left me no moment alone, and in the latter I started hourly from dreams
U||   of unutterable fear to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face,
U||   and its vast weight—an incarnate nightmare that I had no power to shake
U||   off—incumbent eternally upon my heart!
U||   Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of
U||   the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole
U||   intimates—the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of my
U||   usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind;
U||   while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury
U||   to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas,
U||   was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.
U||   One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar
U||   of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The cat
U||   followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,
U||   exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my
U||   wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a
U||   blow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal
U||   had it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of
U||   my wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal,
U||   I withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. She
U||   fell dead upon the spot, without a groan.
U||   This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with
U||   entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I
U||   could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without
U||   the risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered my
U||   mind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute
U||   fragments, and destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to dig a
U||   grave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about
U||   casting it in the well in the yard—about packing it in a box, as if
U||   merchandise, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to
U||   take it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a far
U||   better expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in
U||   the cellar—as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled
U||   up their victims.
U||   For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were
U||   loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a
U||   rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from
U||   hardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by a
U||   false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to
U||   resemble the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily
U||   displace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the
U||   whole up as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious.
U||   And in this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I
U||   easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body
U||   against the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with
U||   little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood.
U||   Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution,
U||   I prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and
U||   with this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I had
U||   finished, I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present
U||   the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on the
U||   floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around
U||   triumphantly, and said to myself: “Here at least, then, my labor has
U||   not been in vain.”
U||   My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so
U||   much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to
U||   death. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have
U||   been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had
U||   been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to
U||   present itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe, or to
U||   imagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of
U||   the detested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its
U||   appearance during the night; and thus for one night at least, since its
U||   introduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept
U||   even with the burden of murder upon my soul!
U||   The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.
U||   Once again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled
U||   the premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was
U||   supreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few
U||   inquiries had been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a
U||   search had been instituted—but of course nothing was to be discovered.
U||   I looked upon my future felicity as secured.
U||   Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came,
U||   very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous
U||   investigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability
U||   of my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The
U||   officers bade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or
U||   corner unexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they
U||   descended into the cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat
U||   calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar
U||   from end to end. I folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to
U||   and fro. The police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart.
U||   The glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say
U||   if but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their
U||   assurance of my guiltlessness.
U||   “Gentlemen,” I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, “I
U||   delight to have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health, and a
U||   little more courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this—this is a very
U||   well-constructed house.” (In the rabid desire to say something easily,
U||   I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.)—“I may say an excellently
U||   well-constructed house. These walls—are you going, gentlemen?—these
U||   walls are solidly put together;” and here, through the mere phrenzy of
U||   bravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon
U||   that very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of
U||   the wife of my bosom.
U||   But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! No
U||   sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was
U||   answered by a voice from within the tomb!—by a cry, at first muffled
U||   and broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into
U||   one long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman—a
U||   howl—a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as
U||   might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the
U||   damned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.
U||   Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to the
U||   opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remained
U||   motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a
U||   dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse,
U||   already greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the
U||   eyes of the spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and
U||   solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me
U||   into murder, and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman.
U||   I had walled the monster up within the tomb!
U||THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER
U||   Son cœur est un luth suspendu;
U||   Sitôt qu’on le touche il résonne..
U||   —De Béranger.
U||   During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of
U||   the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had
U||   been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of
U||   country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew
U||   on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it
U||   was—but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of
U||   insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the
U||   feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic,
U||   sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest
U||   natural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene
U||   before me—upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the
U||   domain—upon the bleak walls—upon the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few
U||   rank sedges—and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees—with an utter
U||   depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more
U||   properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium—the bitter
U||   lapse into everyday life—the hideous dropping off of the veil. There
U||   was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart—an unredeemed
U||   dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture
U||   into aught of the sublime. What was it—I paused to think—what was it
U||   that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was
U||   a mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies
U||   that crowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the
U||   unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are
U||   combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of
U||   thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among
U||   considerations beyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a
U||   mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the
U||   details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to
U||   annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this
U||   idea, I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid
U||   tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down—but
U||   with a shudder even more thrilling than before—upon the remodelled and
U||   inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the
U||   vacant and eye-like windows.
U||   Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a
U||   sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of
U||   my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our
U||   last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant
U||   part of the country—a letter from him—which, in its wildly importunate
U||   nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave
U||   evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily
U||   illness—of a mental disorder which oppressed him—and of an earnest
U||   desire to see me, as his best, and indeed his only personal friend,
U||   with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some
U||   alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and
U||   much more, was said—it was the apparent heart that went with his
U||   request—which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly
U||   obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.
U||   Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really
U||   knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and
U||   habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been
U||   noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament,
U||   displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and
U||   manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive
U||   charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies,
U||   perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable
U||   beauties, of musical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable
U||   fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had
U||   put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the
U||   entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with
U||   very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this
U||   deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect
U||   keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character
U||   of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which
U||   the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the
U||   other—it was this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the
U||   consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony
U||   with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge
U||   the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal
U||   appellation of the “House of Usher”—an appellation which seemed to
U||   include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and
U||   the family mansion.
U||   I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish
U||   experiment—that of looking down within the tarn—had been to deepen the
U||   first singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness
U||   of the rapid increase of my superstition—for why should I not so term
U||   it?—served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have long
U||   known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a
U||   basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again
U||   uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there
U||   grew in my mind a strange fancy—a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I
U||   but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which
U||   oppressed me. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe
U||   that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere
U||   peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity—an atmosphere which
U||   had no affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from
U||   the decayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn—a pestilent
U||   and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.
U||   Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more
U||   narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed
U||   to be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had
U||   been great. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a
U||   fine tangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any
U||   extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and
U||   there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect
U||   adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual
U||   stones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious
U||   totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some
U||   neglected vault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external
U||   air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric
U||   gave little token of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing
U||   observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which,
U||   extending from the roof of the building in front, made its way down the
U||   wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters
U||   of the tarn.
U||   Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A
U||   servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of
U||   the hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence,
U||   through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio
U||   of his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know
U||   not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already
U||   spoken. While the objects around me—while the carvings of the ceilings,
U||   the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors,
U||   and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode,
U||   were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed
U||   from my infancy—while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was
U||   all this—I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which
U||   ordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the
U||   physician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled
U||   expression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with
U||   trepidation and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered
U||   me into the presence of his master.
U||   The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows
U||   were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the
U||   black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble
U||   gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed
U||   panes, and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent
U||   objects around; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the
U||   remoter angles of the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and
U||   fretted ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon the walls. The general
U||   furniture was profuse, comfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books
U||   and musical instruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any
U||   vitality to the scene. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.
U||   An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded
U||   all.
U||   Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at
U||   full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in
U||   it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality—of the constrained
U||   effort of the ennuyé man of the world. A glance, however, at his
U||   countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and
U||   for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling
U||   half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly
U||   altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with
U||   difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan
U||   being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the
U||   character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A
U||   cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond
U||   comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly
U||   beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth
U||   of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin,
U||   speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of
U||   a more than web-like softness and tenuity; these features, with an
U||   inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up
U||   altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the
U||   mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of
U||   the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I
U||   doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the
U||   now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even
U||   awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded,
U||   and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about
U||   the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque
U||   expression with any idea of simple humanity.
U||   In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence—an
U||   inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble
U||   and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy—an excessive
U||   nervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been
U||   prepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain
U||   boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical
U||   conformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and
U||   sullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the
U||   animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic
U||   concision—that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding
U||   enunciation—that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural
U||   utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the
U||   irreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense
U||   excitement.
U||   It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest
U||   desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He
U||   entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his
U||   malady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one
U||   for which he despaired to find a remedy—a mere nervous affection, he
U||   immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed
U||   itself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed
U||   them, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and
U||   the general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much
U||   from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone
U||   endurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors of
U||   all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint
U||   light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed
U||   instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.
U||   To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. “I shall
U||   perish,” said he, “I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus,
U||   and not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future,
U||   not in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought of
U||   any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this
U||   intolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,
U||   except in its absolute effect—in terror. In this unnerved—in this
U||   pitiable condition—I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive
U||   when I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the
U||   grim phantasm, FEAR.”
U||   I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal
U||   hints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He was
U||   enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the
U||   dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never
U||   ventured forth—in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was
U||   conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be re-stated—an influence which
U||   some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family
U||   mansion, had, by dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his
U||   spirit—an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets, and
U||   of the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length,
U||   brought about upon the morale of his existence.
U||   He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the
U||   peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more
U||   natural and far more palpable origin—to the severe and long-continued
U||   illness—indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution—of a tenderly
U||   beloved sister—his sole companion for long years—his last and only
U||   relative on earth. “Her decease,” he said, with a bitterness which I
U||   can never forget, “would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the
U||   last of the ancient race of the Ushers.” While he spoke, the lady
U||   Madeline (for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion
U||   of the apartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared.
U||   I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread—and
U||   yet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of
U||   stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a
U||   door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and
U||   eagerly the countenance of the brother—but he had buried his face in
U||   his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary
U||   wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled
U||   many passionate tears.
U||   The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her
U||   physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person, and
U||   frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical
U||   character, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne
U||   up against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself
U||   finally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at
U||   the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with
U||   inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and
U||   I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus
U||   probably be the last I should obtain—that the lady, at least while
U||   living, would be seen by me no more.
U||   For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or
U||   myself; and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to
U||   alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or
U||   I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his
U||   speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy
U||   admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more
U||   bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind
U||   from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth
U||   upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing
U||   radiation of gloom.
U||   I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus
U||   spent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in
U||   any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies, or
U||   of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An
U||   excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over
U||   all. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among
U||   other things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion
U||   and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From
U||   the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew,
U||   touch by touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more
U||   thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing not why—from these paintings
U||   (vivid as their images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to
U||   educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of
U||   merely written words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his
U||   designs, he arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an
U||   idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least—in the
U||   circumstances then surrounding me—there arose out of the pure
U||   abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his
U||   canvass, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I
U||   ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete
U||   reveries of Fuseli.
U||   One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so
U||   rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although
U||   feebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an
U||   immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth,
U||   white, and without interruption or device. Certain accessory points of
U||   the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at
U||   an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was
U||   observed in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other
U||   artificial source of light was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays
U||   rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate
U||   splendor.
U||   I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which
U||   rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of
U||   certain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow
U||   limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave
U||   birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his
U||   performances. But the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so
U||   accounted for. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as
U||   in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied
U||   himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense
U||   mental collectedness and concentration to which I have previously
U||   alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest
U||   artificial excitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have
U||   easily remembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it,
U||   as he gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning,
U||   I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full
U||   consciousness on the part of Usher of the tottering of his lofty reason
U||   upon her throne. The verses, which were entitled “The Haunted Palace,”
U||   ran very nearly, if not accurately, thus:
U||                           I.
U||   In the greenest of our valleys,
U||       By good angels tenanted,
U||   Once a fair and stately palace—
U||       Radiant palace—reared its head.
U||   In the monarch Thought’s dominion—
U||       It stood there!
U||   Never seraph spread a pinion
U||       Over fabric half so fair.
U||                           II.
U||   Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
U||       On its roof did float and flow;
U||   (This—all this—was in the olden
U||       Time long ago)
U||   And every gentle air that dallied,
U||       In that sweet day,
U||   Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
U||       A winged odor went away.
U||                           III.
U||   Wanderers in that happy valley
U||       Through two luminous windows saw
U||   Spirits moving musically
U||       To a lute’s well-tunéd law,
U||   Round about a throne, where sitting
U||       (Porphyrogene!)
U||   In state his glory well befitting,
U||       The ruler of the realm was seen.
U||                           IV.
U||   And all with pearl and ruby glowing
U||       Was the fair palace door,
U||   Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
U||       And sparkling evermore,
U||   A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
U||       Was but to sing,
U||   In voices of surpassing beauty,
U||       The wit and wisdom of their king.
U||                           V.
U||   But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
U||       Assailed the monarch’s high estate;
U||   (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow
U||       Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)
U||   And, round about his home, the glory
U||       That blushed and bloomed
U||   Is but a dim-remembered story
U||       Of the old time entombed.
U||                           VI.
U||   And travellers now within that valley,
U||       Through the red-litten windows, see
U||   Vast forms that move fantastically
U||       To a discordant melody;
U||   While, like a rapid ghastly river,
U||       Through the pale door,
U||   A hideous throng rush out forever,
U||       And laugh—but smile no more.
U||   I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into
U||   a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher’s
U||   which I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men *
U||   have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which he
U||   maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the
U||   sentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the
U||   idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain
U||   conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express
U||   the full extent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion. The belief,
U||   however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray
U||   stones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience
U||   had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of
U||   these stones—in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of
U||   the many fungi which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which
U||   stood around—above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this
U||   arrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.
U||   Its evidence—the evidence of the sentience—was to be seen, he said,
U||   (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain
U||   condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the
U||   walls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet
U||   importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the
U||   destinies of his family, and which made him what I now saw him—what he
U||   was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.
U||   * Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of
U||   Landaff.—See “Chemical Essays,” vol v.
U||   Our books—the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of
U||   the mental existence of the invalid—were, as might be supposed, in
U||   strict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over
U||   such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of
U||   Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage
U||   of Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean
U||   D’Indaginé, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of
U||   Tieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was a
U||   small octavo edition of the Directorium Inquisitorium, by the Dominican
U||   Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela, about
U||   the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sit
U||   dreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the
U||   perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic—the
U||   manual of a forgotten church—the Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum
U||   Ecclesiae Maguntinae.
U||   I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its
U||   probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having
U||   informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his
U||   intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its
U||   final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls
U||   of the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this
U||   singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to
U||   dispute. The brother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by
U||   consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased,
U||   of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical
U||   men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of
U||   the family. I will not deny that when I called to mind the sinister
U||   countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of
U||   my arrival at the house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as
U||   at best but a harmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.
U||   At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for
U||   the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone
U||   bore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had
U||   been so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its
U||   oppressive atmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation)
U||   was small, damp, and entirely without means of admission for light;
U||   lying, at great depth, immediately beneath that portion of the building
U||   in which was my own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently,
U||   in remote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and,
U||   in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly
U||   combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole
U||   interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were carefully
U||   sheathed with copper. The door, of massive iron, had been, also,
U||   similarly protected. Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp
U||   grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.
U||   Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region
U||   of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the
U||   coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude
U||   between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and
U||   Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from
U||   which I learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that
U||   sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between
U||   them. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead—for we could
U||   not regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in
U||   the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly
U||   cataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and
U||   the face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is
U||   so terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having
U||   secured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely
U||   less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.
U||   And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change
U||   came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His
U||   ordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected
U||   or forgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal,
U||   and objectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if
U||   possible, a more ghastly hue—but the luminousness of his eye had
U||   utterly gone out. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard
U||   no more; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually
U||   characterized his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought
U||   his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret,
U||   to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage. At times,
U||   again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries
U||   of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an
U||   attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to some
U||   imaginary sound. It was no wonder that his condition terrified—that it
U||   infected me. I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the
U||   wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.
U||   It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the
U||   seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the
U||   donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came
U||   not near my couch—while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to
U||   reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to
U||   believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the
U||   bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room—of the dark
U||   and tattered draperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a
U||   rising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled
U||   uneasily about the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were
U||   fruitless. An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at
U||   length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless
U||   alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself
U||   upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of
U||   the chamber, harkened—I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit
U||   prompted me—to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through
U||   the pauses of the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.
U||   Overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet
U||   unendurable, I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should
U||   sleep no more during the night), and endeavored to arouse myself from
U||   the pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to
U||   and fro through the apartment.
U||   I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an
U||   adjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as
U||   that of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch,
U||   at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,
U||   cadaverously wan—but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in
U||   his eyes—an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor. His
U||   air appalled me—but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had
U||   so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.
U||   “And you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared about
U||   him for some moments in silence—“you have not then seen it?—but, stay!
U||   you shall.” Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he
U||   hurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.
U||   The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.
U||   It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one
U||   wildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had
U||   apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent
U||   and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding
U||   density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets
U||   of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity
U||   with which they flew careering from all points against each other,
U||   without passing away into the distance. I say that even their exceeding
U||   density did not prevent our perceiving this—yet we had no glimpse of
U||   the moon or stars—nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning.
U||   But the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as
U||   all terrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the
U||   unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous
U||   exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion.
U||   “You must not—you shall not behold this!” said I, shudderingly, to
U||   Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.
U||   “These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena
U||   not uncommon—or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the
U||   rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement;—the air is
U||   chilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite
U||   romances. I will read, and you shall listen;—and so we will pass away
U||   this terrible night together.”
U||   The antique volume which I had taken up was the “Mad Trist” of Sir
U||   Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher’s more in
U||   sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth
U||   and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty
U||   and spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book
U||   immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement
U||   which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the
U||   history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the
U||   extremeness of the folly which I should read. Could I have judged,
U||   indeed, by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he
U||   harkened, or apparently harkened, to the words of the tale, I might
U||   well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design.
U||   I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred,
U||   the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission
U||   into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by
U||   force. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run
U||   thus:
U||   “And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now
U||   mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had
U||   drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in
U||   sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain
U||   upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his
U||   mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of
U||   the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily,
U||   he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the
U||   dry and hollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the
U||   forest.”
U||   At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment,
U||   paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my
U||   excited fancy had deceived me)—it appeared to me that, from some very
U||   remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears,
U||   what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo
U||   (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping
U||   sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond
U||   doubt, the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid
U||   the rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary
U||   commingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself,
U||   had nothing, surely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I
U||   continued the story:
U||   “But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore
U||   enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but,
U||   in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and
U||   of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a
U||   floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass
U||   with this legend enwritten—
U||   Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;
U||   Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;
U||   And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon,
U||   which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so
U||   horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to
U||   close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the
U||   like whereof was never before heard.”
U||   Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild
U||   amazement—for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance,
U||   I did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I found
U||   it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh,
U||   protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound—the exact
U||   counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon’s
U||   unnatural shriek as described by the romancer.
U||   Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and
U||   most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations,
U||   in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained
U||   sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the
U||   sensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that
U||   he had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange
U||   alteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his
U||   demeanor. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought
U||   round his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber;
U||   and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw
U||   that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had
U||   dropped upon his breast—yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the
U||   wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in
U||   profile. The motion of his body, too, was at variance with this
U||   idea—for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and
U||   uniform sway. Having rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the
U||   narrative of Sir Launcelot, which thus proceeded:
U||   “And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the
U||   dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up
U||   of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of
U||   the way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement
U||   of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth
U||   tarried not for his full coming, but fell down at his feet upon the
U||   silver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.”
U||   No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than—as if a shield of
U||   brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of
U||   silver—I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous,
U||   yet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to
U||   my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I
U||   rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before
U||   him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony
U||   rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a
U||   strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his
U||   lips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur,
U||   as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length
U||   drank in the hideous import of his words.
U||   “Not hear it?—yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long—long—long—many
U||   minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard it—yet I dared not—oh,
U||   pity me, miserable wretch that I am!—I dared not—I dared not speak! We
U||   have put her living in the tomb! Said I not that my senses were acute?
U||   I now tell you that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow
U||   coffin. I heard them—many, many days ago—yet I dared not—I dared not
U||   speak! And now—to-night—Ethelred—ha! ha!—the breaking of the hermit’s
U||   door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the
U||   shield!—say, rather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the
U||   iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles within the coppered
U||   archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here
U||   anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard
U||   her footstep on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible
U||   beating of her heart? Madman!”—here he sprang furiously to his feet,
U||   and shrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving up
U||   his soul—“Madman! I tell you that she now stands without the door!”
U||   As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found
U||   the potency of a spell—the huge antique pannels to which the speaker
U||   pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony
U||   jaws. It was the work of the rushing gust—but then without those doors
U||   there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of
U||   Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some
U||   bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment
U||   she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold—then,
U||   with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her
U||   brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to
U||   the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.
U||   From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm was
U||   still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old
U||   causeway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned
U||   to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house
U||   and its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the
U||   full, setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that
U||   once barely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as
U||   extending from the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the
U||   base. While I gazed, this fissure rapidly widened—there came a fierce
U||   breath of the whirlwind—the entire orb of the satellite burst at once
U||   upon my sight—my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing
U||   asunder—there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a
U||   thousand waters—and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly
U||   and silently over the fragments of the “House of Usher.”
U||SILENCE—A FABLE
U||   “The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and caves are silent.”
U||   “Listen to me,” said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my head. “The
U||   region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of
U||   the river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.
U||   “The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow
U||   not onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the
U||   red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many
U||   miles on either side of the river’s oozy bed is a pale desert of
U||   gigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude,
U||   and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to
U||   and fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur
U||   which cometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water.
U||   And they sigh one unto the other.
U||   “But there is a boundary to their realm—the boundary of the dark,
U||   horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the
U||   low underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout
U||   the heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and
U||   thither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,
U||   one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonous
U||   flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a
U||   rustling and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever, until
U||   they roll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is
U||   no wind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire
U||   there is neither quiet nor silence.
U||   “It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having
U||   fallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall and the
U||   rain fell upon my head—and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the
U||   solemnity of their desolation.
U||   “And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and
U||   was crimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which
U||   stood by the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light of the
U||   moon. And the rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall,—and the rock was
U||   gray. Upon its front were characters engraven in the stone; and I
U||   walked through the morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the
U||   shore, that I might read the characters upon the stone. But I could not
U||   decypher them. And I was going back into the morass, when the moon
U||   shone with a fuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock,
U||   and upon the characters, and the characters were DESOLATION.
U||   “And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the
U||   rock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the
U||   actions of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and was
U||   wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And
U||   the outlines of his figure were indistinct—but his features were the
U||   features of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and
U||   of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his
U||   face. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;
U||   and, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and
U||   weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.
U||   “And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and
U||   looked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet
U||   shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the
U||   rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within
U||   shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the man
U||   trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned, and he sat upon the
U||   rock.
U||   “And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon
U||   the dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon
U||   the pale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs
U||   of the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them.
U||   And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man.
U||   And the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned and he sat
U||   upon the rock.
U||   “Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in
U||   among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami
U||   which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the
U||   hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot
U||   of the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I
U||   lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the
U||   man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned and he sat upon the
U||   rock.
U||   “Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful
U||   tempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had been no wind.
U||   And the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest—and the
U||   rain beat upon the head of the man—and the floods of the river came
U||   down—and the river was tormented into foam—and the water-lilies
U||   shrieked within their beds—and the forest crumbled before the wind—and
U||   the thunder rolled—and the lightning fell—and the rock rocked to its
U||   foundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions
U||   of the man. And the man trembled in the solitude;—but the night waned
U||   and he sat upon the rock.
U||   “Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river,
U||   and the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the
U||   thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,
U||   and were still. And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to
U||   heaven—and the thunder died away—and the lightning did not flash—and
U||   the clouds hung motionless—and the waters sunk to their level and
U||   remained—and the trees ceased to rock—and the water-lilies sighed no
U||   more—and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow
U||   of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the
U||   characters of the rock, and they were changed; and the characters were
U||   SILENCE.
U||   “And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his
U||   countenance was wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head
U||   from his hand, and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there
U||   was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters
U||   upon the rock were SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face
U||   away, and fled afar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.”
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi—in the iron-bound,
U||   melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories
U||   of the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty sea—and of the Genii
U||   that over-ruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was
U||   much lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy,
U||   holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around
U||   Dodona—but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as he
U||   sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most
U||   wonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell
U||   back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh
U||   with the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the
U||   lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay
U||   down at the feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.
U||THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.
U||   The “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever
U||   been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal—the
U||   redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden
U||   dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.
U||   The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the
U||   victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the
U||   sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and
U||   termination of the disease, were the incidents of half an hour.
U||   But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his
U||   dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand
U||   hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his
U||   court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his
U||   castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure,
U||   the creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong
U||   and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The
U||   courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and
U||   welded the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress or
U||   egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The
U||   abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might
U||   bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of
U||   itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince
U||   had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there
U||   were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers, there were musicians,
U||   there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and security were within.
U||   Without was the “Red Death.”
U||   It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,
U||   and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince
U||   Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most
U||   unusual magnificence.
U||   It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of
U||   the rooms in which it was held. There were seven—an imperial suite. In
U||   many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista,
U||   while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand,
U||   so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case
U||   was very different; as might have been expected from the duke’s love of
U||   the bizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the
U||   vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp
U||   turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect.
U||   To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow
U||   Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the
U||   windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color
U||   varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the
U||   chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung,
U||   for example, in blue—and vividly blue were its windows. The second
U||   chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes
U||   were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements.
U||   The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange—the fifth with
U||   white—the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded
U||   in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the
U||   walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and
U||   hue. But in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to
U||   correspond with the decorations. The panes here were scarlet—a deep
U||   blood color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp
U||   or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay
U||   scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no light of
U||   any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers.
U||   But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to
U||   each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected
U||   its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room.
U||   And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances.
U||   But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that
U||   streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was
U||   ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the
U||   countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company
U||   bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.
U||   It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western
U||   wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a
U||   dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the
U||   circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from
U||   the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep
U||   and exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that,
U||   at each lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were
U||   constrained to pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to
U||   the sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and
U||   there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the
U||   chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew
U||   pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows
U||   as if in confused reverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully
U||   ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians
U||   looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and
U||   folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next
U||   chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and
U||   then, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which embrace three thousand
U||   and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies), there came yet another
U||   chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and
U||   tremulousness and meditation as before.
U||   But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel. The
U||   tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and
U||   effects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold
U||   and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are
U||   some who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was
U||   not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he
U||   was not.
U||   He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the
U||   seven chambers, upon occasion of this great fête; and it was his own
U||   guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure
U||   they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and
U||   phantasm—much of what has been since seen in “Hernani.” There were
U||   arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were
U||   delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of the
U||   beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the
U||   terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To
U||   and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of
U||   dreams. And these—the dreams—writhed in and about, taking hue from the
U||   rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo
U||   of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands
U||   in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and
U||   all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen
U||   as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away—they have endured
U||   but an instant—and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as
U||   they depart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and
U||   writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the
U||   many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But
U||   to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now
U||   none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and
U||   there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the
U||   blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon
U||   the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled
U||   peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who
U||   indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.
U||   But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat
U||   feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until
U||   at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And
U||   then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the
U||   waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things
U||   as before. But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell
U||   of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought
U||   crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among
U||   those who revelled. And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before
U||   the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there
U||   were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become
U||   aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the
U||   attention of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new
U||   presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at
U||   length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of
U||   disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of
U||   disgust.
U||   In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be
U||   supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.
U||   In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but
U||   the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the
U||   bounds of even the prince’s indefinite decorum. There are chords in the
U||   hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion.
U||   Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests,
U||   there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company,
U||   indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of
U||   the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and
U||   gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave.
U||   The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the
U||   countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have
U||   had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been
U||   endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer
U||   had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was
U||   dabbled in blood—and his broad brow, with all the features of the face,
U||   was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.
U||   When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which
U||   with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role,
U||   stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in
U||   the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste;
U||   but, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.
U||   “Who dares?” he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near
U||   him—“who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and
U||   unmask him—that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the
U||   battlements!”
U||   It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince
U||   Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven
U||   rooms loudly and clearly—for the prince was a bold and robust man, and
U||   the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand.
U||   It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale
U||   courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight
U||   rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at
U||   the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately
U||   step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless
U||   awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole
U||   party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that,
U||   unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince’s person; and, while
U||   the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of
U||   the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the
U||   same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the
U||   first, through the blue chamber to the purple—through the purple to the
U||   green—through the green to the orange—through this again to the
U||   white—and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been
U||   made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,
U||   maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice,
U||   rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on
U||   account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a
U||   drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three
U||   or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained
U||   the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted
U||   his pursuer. There was a sharp cry—and the dagger dropped gleaming upon
U||   the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in
U||   death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair,
U||   a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black
U||   apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and
U||   motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable
U||   horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they
U||   handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.
U||   And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come
U||   like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the
U||   blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing
U||   posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with that
U||   of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And
U||   Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over
U||   all.
U||THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.
U||   The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but
U||   when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know
U||   the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance
U||   to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point
U||   definitively settled—but the very definitiveness with which it was
U||   resolved, precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but
U||   punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes
U||   its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make
U||   himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.
U||   It must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given
U||   Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to
U||   smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the
U||   thought of his immolation.
U||   He had a weak point—this Fortunato—although in other regards he was a
U||   man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his
U||   connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.
U||   For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and
U||   opportunity—to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian
U||   millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,
U||   was a quack—but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this
U||   respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skilful in the
U||   Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.
U||   It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the
U||   carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with
U||   excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley.
U||   He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was
U||   surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him,
U||   that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.
U||   I said to him: “My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably
U||   well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes
U||   for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.”
U||   “How?” said he. “Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of
U||   the carnival!”
U||   “I have my doubts,” I replied; “and I was silly enough to pay the full
U||   Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to
U||   be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.”
U||   “Amontillado!”
U||   “I have my doubts.”
U||   “Amontillado!”
U||   “And I must satisfy them.”
U||   “Amontillado!”
U||   “As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a
U||   critical turn, it is he. He will tell me—”
U||   “Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.”
U||   “And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your
U||   own.”
U||   “Come, let us go.”
U||   “Whither?”
U||   “To your vaults.”
U||   “My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you
U||   have an engagement. Luchesi—”
U||   “I have no engagement;—come.”
U||   “My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with
U||   which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp.
U||   They are encrusted with nitre.”
U||   “Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You
U||   have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish
U||   Sherry from Amontillado.”
U||   Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask
U||   of black silk, and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I
U||   suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.
U||   There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in
U||   honor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the
U||   morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.
U||   These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate
U||   disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.
U||   I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,
U||   bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into
U||   the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him
U||   to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the
U||   descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the
U||   Montresors.
U||   The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled
U||   as he strode.
U||   “The pipe,” said he.
U||   “It is farther on,” said I; “but observe the white web-work which
U||   gleams from these cavern walls.”
U||   He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that
U||   distilled the rheum of intoxication.
U||   “Nitre?” he asked, at length.
U||   “Nitre,” I replied. “How long have you had that cough?”
U||   “Ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh!
U||   ugh!”
U||   My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.
U||   “It is nothing,” he said, at last.
U||   “Come,” I said, with decision, “we will go back; your health is
U||   precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as
U||   once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will
U||   go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there
U||   is Luchesi—”
U||   “Enough,” he said; “the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I
U||   shall not die of a cough.”
U||   “True—true,” I replied; “and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming
U||   you unnecessarily—but you should use all proper caution. A draught of
U||   this Medoc will defend us from the damps.”
U||   Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of
U||   its fellows that lay upon the mould.
U||   “Drink,” I said, presenting him the wine.
U||   He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me
U||   familiarly, while his bells jingled.
U||   “I drink,” he said, “to the buried that repose around us.”
U||   “And I to your long life.”
U||   He again took my arm, and we proceeded.
U||   “These vaults,” he said, “are extensive.”
U||   “The Montresors,” I replied, “were a great and numerous family.”
U||   “I forget your arms.”
U||   “A huge human foot d’or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent
U||   rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.”
U||   “And the motto?”
U||   “Nemo me impune lacessit.”
U||   “Good!” he said.
U||   The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew
U||   warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with
U||   casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the
U||   catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato
U||   by an arm above the elbow.
U||   “The nitre!” I said: “see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the
U||   vaults. We are below the river’s bed. The drops of moisture trickle
U||   among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough—”
U||   “It is nothing,” he said; “let us go on. But first, another draught of
U||   the Medoc.”
U||   I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grâve. He emptied it at a
U||   breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the
U||   bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.
U||   I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement—a grotesque one.
U||   “You do not comprehend?” he said.
U||   “Not I,” I replied.
U||   “Then you are not of the brotherhood.”
U||   “How?”
U||   “You are not of the masons.”
U||   “Yes, yes,” I said, “yes, yes.”
U||   “You? Impossible! A mason?”
U||   “A mason,” I replied.
U||   “A sign,” he said.
U||   “It is this,” I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of
U||   my roquelaire.
U||   “You jest,” he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. “But let us proceed to
U||   the Amontillado.”
U||   “Be it so,” I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again
U||   offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route
U||   in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,
U||   descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in
U||   which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than
U||   flame.
U||   At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less
U||   spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the
U||   vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three
U||   sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From
U||   the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon
U||   the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall
U||   thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still
U||   interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height
U||   six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in
U||   itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal
U||   supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their
U||   circumscribing walls of solid granite.
U||   It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to
U||   pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did
U||   not enable us to see.
U||   “Proceed,” I said; “herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi—”
U||   “He is an ignoramus,” interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily
U||   forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he
U||   had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress
U||   arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I
U||   had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples,
U||   distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these
U||   depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links
U||   about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He
U||   was too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back
U||   from the recess.
U||   “Pass your hand,” I said, “over the wall; you cannot help feeling the
U||   nitre. Indeed it is very damp. Once more let me implore you to return.
U||   No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all
U||   the little attentions in my power.”
U||   “The Amontillado!” ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his
U||   astonishment.
U||   “True,” I replied; “the Amontillado.”
U||   As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which
U||   I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity
U||   of building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of
U||   my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.
U||   I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered that
U||   the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The
U||   earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth
U||   of the recess. It was not the cry of a drunken man. There was then a
U||   long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and
U||   the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The
U||   noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to
U||   it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the
U||   bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and
U||   finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh
U||   tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again
U||   paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few
U||   feeble rays upon the figure within.
U||   A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the
U||   throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a
U||   brief moment I hesitated—I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to
U||   grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured
U||   me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt
U||   satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who
U||   clamored. I re-echoed—I aided—I surpassed them in volume and in
U||   strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.
U||   It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had
U||   completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a
U||   portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone
U||   to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it
U||   partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the
U||   niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded
U||   by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the
U||   noble Fortunato. The voice said—
U||   “Ha! ha! ha!—he! he!—a very good joke indeed—an excellent jest. We will
U||   have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo—he! he! he!—over our
U||   wine—he! he! he!”
U||   “The Amontillado!” I said.
U||   “He! he! he!—he! he! he!—yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting
U||   late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato
U||   and the rest? Let us be gone.”
U||   “Yes,” I said, “let us be gone.”
U||   “For the love of God, Montressor!”
U||   “Yes,” I said, “for the love of God!”
U||   But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I
U||   called aloud—
U||   “Fortunato!”
U||   No answer. I called again—
U||   “Fortunato!”
U||   No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and
U||   let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the
U||   bells. My heart grew sick—on account of the dampness of the catacombs.
U||   I hastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last stone into its
U||   position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the
U||   old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed
U||   them. In pace requiescat!
U||THE IMP OF THE PERVERSE
U||   In the consideration of the faculties and impulses—of the prima mobilia
U||   of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a
U||   propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive,
U||   irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists
U||   who have preceded them. In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have
U||   all overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses,
U||   solely through want of belief—of faith;—whether it be faith in
U||   Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred
U||   to us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the
U||   impulse—for the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We
U||   could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had
U||   the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;—we could not
U||   have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects
U||   of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that
U||   phrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been
U||   concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man, rather than the
U||   understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs—to
U||   dictate purposes to God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the
U||   intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable
U||   systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first
U||   determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that
U||   man should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness, and
U||   this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-I
U||   nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be God’s will that
U||   man should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness,
U||   forthwith. And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality,
U||   with constructiveness,—so, in short, with every organ, whether
U||   representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure
U||   intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action,
U||   the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole,
U||   have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors;
U||   deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of
U||   man, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.
U||   It would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if
U||   classify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally
U||   did, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of
U||   what we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do. If we cannot
U||   comprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable
U||   thoughts, that call the works into being? If we cannot understand him
U||   in his objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and
U||   phases of creation?
U||   Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an
U||   innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical
U||   something, which we may call perverseness, for want of a more
U||   characteristic term. In the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a mobile
U||   without motive, a motive not motivirt. Through its promptings we act
U||   without comprehensible object; or, if this shall be understood as a
U||   contradiction in terms, we may so far modify the proposition as to say,
U||   that through its promptings we act, for the reason that we should not.
U||   In theory, no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is
U||   none more strong. With certain minds, under certain conditions, it
U||   becomes absolutely irresistible. I am not more certain that I breathe,
U||   than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often
U||   the one unconquerable force which impels us, and alone impels us to its
U||   prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the
U||   wrong’s sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements.
U||   It is a radical, a primitive impulse—elementary. It will be said, I am
U||   aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not
U||   persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that which
U||   ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a glance
U||   will show the fallacy of this idea. The phrenological combativeness has
U||   for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard
U||   against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the
U||   desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development. It
U||   follows, that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with
U||   any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness,
U||   but in the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire
U||   to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly antagonistical
U||   sentiment exists.
U||   An appeal to one’s own heart is, after all, the best reply to the
U||   sophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly
U||   questions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness
U||   of the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than
U||   distinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not been
U||   tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by
U||   circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every
U||   intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear; the most
U||   laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his
U||   tongue; it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from
U||   giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he
U||   addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions
U||   and parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is
U||   enough. The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the
U||   desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep
U||   regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all
U||   consequences) is indulged.
U||   We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that
U||   it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life
U||   calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we
U||   are consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation
U||   of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall
U||   be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow; and why?
U||   There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with
U||   no comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a
U||   more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of
U||   anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because
U||   unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the
U||   moments fly. The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the
U||   violence of the conflict within us,—of the definite with the
U||   indefinite—of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have
U||   proceeded thus far, it is the shadow which prevails,—we struggle in
U||   vain. The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same
U||   time, it is the chanticleer-note to the ghost that has so long overawed
U||   us. It flies—it disappears—we are free. The old energy returns. We will
U||   labor now. Alas, it is too late!
U||   We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss—we grow
U||   sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.
U||   Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and
U||   horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations,
U||   still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor
U||   from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights.
U||   But out of this our cloud upon the precipice’s edge, there grows into
U||   palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of
U||   a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one
U||   which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the
U||   delight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our
U||   sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a
U||   height. And this fall—this rushing annihilation—for the very reason
U||   that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most
U||   ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever
U||   presented themselves to our imagination—for this very cause do we now
U||   the most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us
U||   from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. There
U||   is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who,
U||   shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To
U||   indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably
U||   lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I
U||   say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we
U||   fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss,
U||   we plunge, and are destroyed.
U||   Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting
U||   solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because we
U||   feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible
U||   principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct
U||   instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to
U||   operate in furtherance of good.
U||   I have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your
U||   question—that I may explain to you why I am here—that I may assign to
U||   you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for
U||   my wearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the
U||   condemned. Had I not been thus prolix, you might either have
U||   misunderstood me altogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad.
U||   As it is, you will easily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted
U||   victims of the Imp of the Perverse.
U||   It is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more
U||   thorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the means
U||   of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes, because their
U||   accomplishment involved a chance of detection. At length, in reading
U||   some French memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that
U||   occurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally
U||   poisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim’s habit of
U||   reading in bed. I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and
U||   ill-ventilated. But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need
U||   not describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room
U||   candle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there
U||   found. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the
U||   coroner’s verdict was—“Death by the visitation of God.”
U||   Having inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea
U||   of detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal
U||   taper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clew
U||   by which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the
U||   crime. It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose
U||   in my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long
U||   period of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded
U||   me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from
U||   my sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the
U||   pleasurable feeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a
U||   haunting and harassing thought. It harassed because it haunted. I could
U||   scarcely get rid of it for an instant. It is quite a common thing to be
U||   thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories,
U||   of the burthen of some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches
U||   from an opera. Nor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself
U||   be good, or the opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would
U||   perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in
U||   a low undertone, the phrase, “I am safe.”
U||   One day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the
U||   act of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of
U||   petulance, I remodelled them thus: “I am safe—I am safe—yes—if I be not
U||   fool enough to make open confession!”
U||   No sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to
U||   my heart. I had had some experience in these fits of perversity (whose
U||   nature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well
U||   that in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now
U||   my own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to
U||   confess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the
U||   very ghost of him whom I had murdered—and beckoned me on to death.
U||   At first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul. I
U||   walked vigorously—faster—still faster—at length I ran. I felt a
U||   maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of thought
U||   overwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood
U||   that to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my
U||   pace. I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares. At
U||   length, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the
U||   consummation of my fate. Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have
U||   done it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears—a rougher grasp seized
U||   me by the shoulder. I turned—I gasped for breath. For a moment I
U||   experienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf, and
U||   giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his
U||   broad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from
U||   my soul.
U||   They say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked
U||   emphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before
U||   concluding the brief but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the
U||   hangman and to hell.
U||   Having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial
U||   conviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.
U||   But why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am here!
U||   To-morrow I shall be fetterless!—but where?
U||THE ISLAND OF THE FAY
U||   Nullus enim locus sine genio est.—Servius.
U||   “La musique,” says Marmontel, in those “Contes Moraux” (*1) which in
U||   all our translations, we have insisted upon calling “Moral Tales,” as
U||   if in mockery of their spirit—“la musique est le seul des talents qui
U||   jouissent de lui-même; tous les autres veulent des temoins.” He here
U||   confounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity
U||   for creating them. No more than any other talent, is that for music
U||   susceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to
U||   appreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talents
U||   that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The
U||   idea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has
U||   sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is,
U||   doubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is the
U||   most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The
U||   proposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who love
U||   the lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses. But there is one
U||   pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only
U||   one—which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of
U||   seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of
U||   natural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of
U||   God upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the
U||   presence—not of human life only, but of life in any other form than
U||   that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless—is
U||   a stain upon the landscape—is at war with the genius of the scene. I
U||   love, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and the
U||   waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy
U||   slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,—I
U||   love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast
U||   animate and sentient whole—a whole whose form (that of the sphere) is
U||   the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among
U||   associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate
U||   sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of
U||   a God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in
U||   immensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own
U||   cognizance of the animalculae which infest the brain—a being which we,
U||   in consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the
U||   same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us.
U||   Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every
U||   hand—notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the
U||   priesthood—that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important
U||   consideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the
U||   stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision,
U||   of the greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies
U||   are accurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest
U||   possible amount of matter;—while the surfaces themselves are so
U||   disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be
U||   accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it any
U||   argument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself is
U||   infinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it. And since
U||   we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a
U||   principle—indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle
U||   in the operations of Deity,—it is scarcely logical to imagine it
U||   confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not
U||   extending to those of the august. As we find cycle within cycle without
U||   end,—yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the
U||   God-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, life
U||   within life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit
U||   Divine? In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in
U||   believing man, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of
U||   more moment in the universe than that vast “clod of the valley” which
U||   he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more
U||   profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation. (*2)
U||   These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
U||   among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a
U||   tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. My
U||   wanderings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and
U||   often solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many
U||   a dim, deep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright
U||   lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have
U||   strayed and gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in
U||   allusion to the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, “la solitude est
U||   une belle chose; mais il faut quelqu’un pour vous dire que la solitude
U||   est une belle chose?” The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the
U||   necessity is a thing that does not exist.
U||   It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region
U||   of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarn
U||   writhing or sleeping within all—that I chanced upon a certain rivulet
U||   and island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw
U||   myself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
U||   that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only
U||   should I look upon it—such was the character of phantasm which it wore.
U||   On all sides—save to the west, where the sun was about sinking—arose
U||   the verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply
U||   in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have
U||   no exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage
U||   of the trees to the east—while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared
U||   to me as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down
U||   noiselessly and continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson
U||   waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky.
U||   About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one
U||   small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of
U||   the stream.
U||   So blended bank and shadow there
U||   That each seemed pendulous in air—
U||   so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to
U||   say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal
U||   dominion began.
U||   My position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and
U||   western extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked
U||   difference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem of
U||   garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant
U||   sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short,
U||   springy, sweet-scented, and asphodel-interspersed. The trees were
U||   lithe, mirthful, erect—bright, slender, and graceful,—of Eastern figure
U||   and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed
U||   a deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from
U||   out the heavens, yet every thing had motion through the gentle
U||   sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been
U||   mistaken for tulips with wings. (*4)
U||   The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.
U||   A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things.
U||   The trees were dark in color, and mournful in form and attitude,
U||   wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that
U||   conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the
U||   deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,
U||   and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low
U||   and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were
U||   not; although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary
U||   clambered. The shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and
U||   seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element
U||   with darkness. I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower
U||   and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,
U||   and thus became absorbed by the stream; while other shadows issued
U||   momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus
U||   entombed.
U||   This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I
U||   lost myself forthwith in revery. “If ever island were enchanted,” said
U||   I to myself, “this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who
U||   remain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?—or do
U||   they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In
U||   dying, do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God,
U||   little by little, their existence, as these trees render up shadow
U||   after shadow, exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the
U||   wasting tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus
U||   blacker by what it preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the
U||   death which engulfs it?”
U||   As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to
U||   rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing
U||   upon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the
U||   sycamore—flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a
U||   quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased—while I
U||   thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays
U||   about whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness
U||   from out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect in
U||   a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an
U||   oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude
U||   seemed indicative of joy—but sorrow deformed it as she passed within
U||   the shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and
U||   re-entered the region of light. “The revolution which has just been
U||   made by the Fay,” continued I, musingly, “is the cycle of the brief
U||   year of her life. She has floated through her winter and through her
U||   summer. She is a year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see
U||   that, as she came into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was
U||   swallowed up in the dark water, making its blackness more black.”
U||   And again the boat appeared and the Fay; but about the attitude of the
U||   latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.
U||   She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened
U||   momently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
U||   became absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the
U||   circuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and
U||   at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,
U||   while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each
U||   passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became
U||   whelmed in a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had utterly
U||   departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went
U||   disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood—and
U||   that she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all
U||   things and I beheld her magical figure no more.
U||THE ASSIGNATION
U||   Stay for me there! I will not fail.
U||   To meet thee in that hollow vale.
U||   (Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King, Bishop of Chichester.)
U||   Ill-fated and mysterious man!—bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own
U||   imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own youth! Again in
U||   fancy I behold thee! Once more thy form hath risen before me!—not—oh!
U||   not as thou art—in the cold valley and shadow—but as thou shouldst
U||   be—squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of
U||   dim visions, thine own Venice—which is a star-beloved Elysium of the
U||   sea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a
U||   deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I
U||   repeat it—as thou shouldst be. There are surely other worlds than
U||   this—other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude—other
U||   speculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall call
U||   thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or
U||   denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but
U||   the overflowings of thine everlasting energies?
U||   It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the Ponte di
U||   Sospiri, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom I
U||   speak. It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind the
U||   circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember—ah! how should I
U||   forget?—the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman,
U||   and the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.
U||   It was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza had
U||   sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of the
U||   Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old Ducal
U||   Palace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the Piazetta, by
U||   way of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of
U||   the canal San Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly
U||   upon the night, in one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek.
U||   Startled at the sound, I sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier,
U||   letting slip his single oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a
U||   chance of recovery, and we were consequently left to the guidance of
U||   the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel.
U||   Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting down
U||   towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux flashing from
U||   the windows, and down the staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at
U||   once that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.
U||   A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from an
U||   upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal. The
U||   quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim; and, although my
U||   own gondola was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in
U||   the stream, was seeking in vain upon the surface, the treasure which
U||   was to be found, alas! only within the abyss. Upon the broad black
U||   marble flagstones at the entrance of the palace, and a few steps above
U||   the water, stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since
U||   forgotten. It was the Marchesa Aphrodite—the adoration of all
U||   Venice—the gayest of the gay—the most lovely where all were
U||   beautiful—but still the young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni,
U||   and the mother of that fair child, her first and only one, who now,
U||   deep beneath the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon
U||   her sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to call
U||   upon her name.
U||   She stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the black
U||   mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more than half
U||   loosened for the night from its ball-room array, clustered, amid a
U||   shower of diamonds, round and round her classical head, in curls like
U||   those of the young hyacinth. A snowy-white and gauze-like drapery
U||   seemed to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form; but the
U||   mid-summer and midnight air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion
U||   in the statue-like form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment
U||   of very vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the
U||   Niobe. Yet—strange to say!—her large lustrous eyes were not turned
U||   downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried—but
U||   riveted in a widely different direction! The prison of the Old Republic
U||   is, I think, the stateliest building in all Venice—but how could that
U||   lady gaze so fixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her only
U||   child? Yon dark, gloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber
U||   window—what, then, could there be in its shadows—in its architecture—in
U||   its ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices—that the Marchesa di Mentoni had
U||   not wondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!—Who does not
U||   remember that, at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered
U||   mirror, multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable
U||   far-off places, the woe which is close at hand?
U||   Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate,
U||   stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He was
U||   occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar, and seemed ennuye to the
U||   very death, as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his
U||   child. Stupefied and aghast, I had myself no power to move from the
U||   upright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must
U||   have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous
U||   appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated down
U||   among them in that funereal gondola.
U||   All efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the search
U||   were relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy sorrow. There
U||   seemed but little hope for the child; (how much less than for the
U||   mother!) but now, from the interior of that dark niche which has been
U||   already mentioned as forming a part of the Old Republican prison, and
U||   as fronting the lattice of the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak,
U||   stepped out within reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the
U||   verge of the giddy descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an
U||   instant afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing child
U||   within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the
U||   Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became unfastened,
U||   and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to the wonder-stricken
U||   spectators the graceful person of a very young man, with the sound of
U||   whose name the greater part of Europe was then ringing.
U||   No word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receive her
U||   child—she will press it to her heart—she will cling to its little form,
U||   and smother it with her caresses. Alas! another’s arms have taken it
U||   from the stranger—another’s arms have taken it away, and borne it afar
U||   off, unnoticed, into the palace! And the Marchesa! Her lip—her
U||   beautiful lip trembles; tears are gathering in her eyes—those eyes
U||   which, like Pliny’s acanthus, are “soft and almost liquid.” Yes! tears
U||   are gathering in those eyes—and see! the entire woman thrills
U||   throughout the soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor
U||   of the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very
U||   purity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide
U||   of ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about her
U||   delicate frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies
U||   in the grass.
U||   Why should that lady blush! To this demand there is no answer—except
U||   that, having left, in the eager haste and terror of a mother’s heart,
U||   the privacy of her own boudoir, she has neglected to enthral her tiny
U||   feet in their slippers, and utterly forgotten to throw over her
U||   Venetian shoulders that drapery which is their due. What other possible
U||   reason could there have been for her so blushing?—for the glance of
U||   those wild appealing eyes?—for the unusual tumult of that throbbing
U||   bosom?—for the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand?—that hand
U||   which fell, as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the
U||   hand of the stranger. What reason could there have been for the low—the
U||   singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered
U||   hurriedly in bidding him adieu? “Thou hast conquered,” she said, or the
U||   murmurs of the water deceived me; “thou hast conquered—one hour after
U||   sunrise—we shall meet—so let it be!”
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the palace,
U||   and the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon the flags. He
U||   shook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye glanced around in
U||   search of a gondola. I could not do less than offer him the service of
U||   my own; and he accepted the civility. Having obtained an oar at the
U||   water-gate, we proceeded together to his residence, while he rapidly
U||   recovered his self-possession, and spoke of our former slight
U||   acquaintance in terms of great apparent cordiality.
U||   There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute. The
U||   person of the stranger—let me call him by this title, who to all the
U||   world was still a stranger—the person of the stranger is one of these
U||   subjects. In height he might have been below rather than above the
U||   medium size: although there were moments of intense passion when his
U||   frame actually expanded and belied the assertion. The light, almost
U||   slender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity
U||   which he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean
U||   strength which he has been known to wield without an effort, upon
U||   occasions of more dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a
U||   deity—singular, wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure
U||   hazel to intense and brilliant jet—and a profusion of curling, black
U||   hair, from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at
U||   intervals all light and ivory—his were features than which I have seen
U||   none more classically regular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the
U||   Emperor Commodus. Yet his countenance was, nevertheless, one of those
U||   which all men have seen at some period of their lives, and have never
U||   afterwards seen again. It had no peculiar, it had no settled
U||   predominant expression to be fastened upon the memory; a countenance
U||   seen and instantly forgotten, but forgotten with a vague and
U||   never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind. Not that the spirit of
U||   each rapid passion failed, at any time, to throw its own distinct image
U||   upon the mirror of that face—but that the mirror, mirror-like, retained
U||   no vestige of the passion, when the passion had departed.
U||   Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, in
U||   what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him very early the next
U||   morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself accordingly at his
U||   Palazzo, one of those huge structures of gloomy, yet fantastic pomp,
U||   which tower above the waters of the Grand Canal in the vicinity of the
U||   Rialto. I was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics, into an
U||   apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door
U||   with an actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.
U||   I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his
U||   possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of
U||   ridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not bring
U||   myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe could have
U||   supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around.
U||   Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still
U||   brilliantly lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well as from
U||   an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend, that he had not
U||   retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night. In the
U||   architecture and embellishments of the chamber, the evident design had
U||   been to dazzle and astound. Little attention had been paid to the
U||   decora of what is technically called keeping, or to the proprieties of
U||   nationality. The eye wandered from object to object, and rested upon
U||   none—neither the grotesques of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures
U||   of the best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt.
U||   Rich draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of
U||   low, melancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The
U||   senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking up
U||   from strange convolute censers, together with multitudinous flaring and
U||   flickering tongues of emerald and violet fire. The rays of the newly
U||   risen sun poured in upon the whole, through windows, formed each of a
U||   single pane of crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand
U||   reflections, from curtains which rolled from their cornices like
U||   cataracts of molten silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at
U||   length fitfully with the artificial light, and lay weltering in subdued
U||   masses upon a carpet of rich, liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.
U||   “Ha! ha! ha!—ha! ha! ha!”—laughed the proprietor, motioning me to a
U||   seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at full-length
U||   upon an ottoman. “I see,” said he, perceiving that I could not
U||   immediately reconcile myself to the bienseance of so singular a
U||   welcome—“I see you are astonished at my apartment—at my statues—my
U||   pictures—my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery!
U||   absolutely drunk, eh, with my magnificence? But pardon me, my dear sir,
U||   (here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,)
U||   pardon me for my uncharitable laughter. You appeared so utterly
U||   astonished. Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous, that a
U||   man must laugh or die. To die laughing, must be the most glorious of
U||   all glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More—a very fine man was Sir Thomas
U||   More—Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in the
U||   Absurdities of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of characters who
U||   came to the same magnificent end. Do you know, however,” continued he
U||   musingly, “that at Sparta (which is now Palæochori,) at Sparta, I say,
U||   to the west of the citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is
U||   a kind of socle, upon which are still legible the letters ΛΑΞΜ. They
U||   are undoubtedly part of ΓΕΛΑΞΜΑ. Now, at Sparta were a thousand temples
U||   and shrines to a thousand different divinities. How exceedingly strange
U||   that the altar of Laughter should have survived all the others! But in
U||   the present instance,” he resumed, with a singular alteration of voice
U||   and manner, “I have no right to be merry at your expense. You might
U||   well have been amazed. Europe cannot produce anything so fine as this,
U||   my little regal cabinet. My other apartments are by no means of the
U||   same order—mere ultras of fashionable insipidity. This is better than
U||   fashion—is it not? Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage—that
U||   is, with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire
U||   patrimony. I have guarded, however, against any such profanation. With
U||   one exception, you are the only human being besides myself and my
U||   valet, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial
U||   precincts, since they have been bedizened as you see!”
U||   I bowed in acknowledgment—for the overpowering sense of splendor and
U||   perfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity of his
U||   address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in words, my
U||   appreciation of what I might have construed into a compliment.
U||   “Here,” he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered
U||   around the apartment, “here are paintings from the Greeks to Cimabue,
U||   and from Cimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen, as you see, with
U||   little deference to the opinions of Virtu. They are all, however,
U||   fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this. Here, too, are some chefs
U||   d’oeuvre of the unknown great; and here, unfinished designs by men,
U||   celebrated in their day, whose very names the perspicacity of the
U||   academies has left to silence and to me. What think you,” said he,
U||   turning abruptly as he spoke—“what think you of this Madonna della
U||   Pieta?”
U||   “It is Guido’s own!” I said, with all the enthusiasm of my nature, for
U||   I had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness. “It is
U||   Guido’s own!—how could you have obtained it?—she is undoubtedly in
U||   painting what the Venus is in sculpture.”
U||   “Ha!” said he thoughtfully, “the Venus—the beautiful Venus?—the Venus
U||   of the Medici?—she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair? Part of
U||   the left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be heard with
U||   difficulty,) and all the right, are restorations; and in the coquetry
U||   of that right arm lies, I think, the quintessence of all affectation.
U||   Give me the Canova! The Apollo, too, is a copy—there can be no doubt of
U||   it—blind fool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of
U||   the Apollo! I cannot help—pity me!—I cannot help preferring the
U||   Antinous. Was it not Socrates who said that the statuary found his
U||   statue in the block of marble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means
U||   original in his couplet—
U||   ‘Non ha l’ottimo artista alcun concetto
U||   Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.’”
U||   It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the true
U||   gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the
U||   vulgar, without being at once precisely able to determine in what such
U||   difference consists. Allowing the remark to have applied in its full
U||   force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance, I felt it, on that
U||   eventful morning, still more fully applicable to his moral temperament
U||   and character. Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which
U||   seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings,
U||   than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought, pervading
U||   even his most trivial actions—intruding upon his moments of
U||   dalliance—and interweaving itself with his very flashes of
U||   merriment—like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning
U||   masks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.
U||   I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the mingled
U||   tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon
U||   matters of little importance, a certain air of trepidation—a degree of
U||   nervous unction in action and in speech—an unquiet excitability of
U||   manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable, and upon some
U||   occasions even filled me with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the
U||   middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten, he
U||   seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as if either in
U||   momentary expectation of a visitor, or to sounds which must have had
U||   existence in his imagination alone.
U||   It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction,
U||   that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar Politian’s
U||   beautiful tragedy “The Orfeo,” (the first native Italian tragedy,)
U||   which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered a passage underlined in
U||   pencil. It was a passage towards the end of the third act—a passage of
U||   the most heart-stirring excitement—a passage which, although tainted
U||   with impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion—no
U||   woman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and,
U||   upon the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines, written
U||   in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my
U||   acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own:—
U||   Thou wast that all to me, love,
U||       For which my soul did pine—
U||   A green isle in the sea, love,
U||       A fountain and a shrine,
U||   All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;
U||       And all the flowers were mine.
U||   Ah, dream too bright to last!
U||       Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise
U||   But to be overcast!
U||       A voice from out the Future cries,
U||   “Onward!”—but o’er the Past
U||       (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,
U||   Mute—motionless—aghast!
U||   For alas! alas! with me
U||       The light of life is o’er.
U||   “No more—no more—no more,”
U||       (Such language holds the solemn sea
U||   To the sands upon the shore,)
U||       Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
U||   Or the stricken eagle soar!
U||   Now all my hours are trances;
U||       And all my nightly dreams
U||   Are where the dark eye glances,
U||       And where thy footstep gleams,
U||   In what ethereal dances,
U||       By what Italian streams.
U||   Alas! for that accursed time
U||       They bore thee o’er the billow,
U||   From Love to titled age and crime,
U||       And an unholy pillow!—
U||   From me, and from our misty clime,
U||       Where weeps the silver willow!
U||   That these lines were written in English—a language with which I had
U||   not believed their author acquainted—afforded me little matter for
U||   surprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements, and
U||   of the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation,
U||   to be astonished at any similar discovery; but the place of date, I
U||   must confess, occasioned me no little amazement. It had been originally
U||   written London, and afterwards carefully overscored—not, however, so
U||   effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this
U||   occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a
U||   former conversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he had at
U||   any time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some years
U||   previous to her marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if
U||   I mistake not, gave me to understand that he had never visited the
U||   metropolis of Great Britain. I might as well here mention, that I have
U||   more than once heard, (without, of course, giving credit to a report
U||   involving so many improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak,
U||   was not only by birth, but in education, an Englishman.
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   “There is one painting,” said he, without being aware of my notice of
U||   the tragedy—“there is still one painting which you have not seen.” And
U||   throwing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait of the
U||   Marchesa Aphrodite.
U||   Human art could have done no more in the delineation of her superhuman
U||   beauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding
U||   night upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once again.
U||   But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all over
U||   with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful
U||   stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the
U||   perfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom.
U||   With her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase. One
U||   small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth; and,
U||   scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to
U||   encircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most
U||   delicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the
U||   figure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman’s Bussy
U||   D’Ambois, quivered instinctively upon my lips:
U||       “He is up
U||   There like a Roman statue! He will stand
U||   Till Death hath made him marble!”
U||   “Come,” he said at length, turning towards a table of richly enamelled
U||   and massive silver, upon which were a few goblets fantastically
U||   stained, together with two large Etruscan vases, fashioned in the same
U||   extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait, and
U||   filled with what I supposed to be Johannisberger. “Come,” he said,
U||   abruptly, “let us drink! It is early—but let us drink. It is indeed
U||   early,” he continued, musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer
U||   made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: “It is
U||   indeed early—but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an
U||   offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are so
U||   eager to subdue!” And, having made me pledge him in a bumper, he
U||   swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine.
U||   “To dream,” he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory
U||   conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the
U||   magnificent vases—“to dream has been the business of my life. I have
U||   therefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of dreams. In the
U||   heart of Venice could I have erected a better? You behold around you,
U||   it is true, a medley of architectural embellishments. The chastity of
U||   Ionia is offended by antediluvian devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt
U||   are outstretched upon carpets of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to
U||   the timid alone. Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the
U||   bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the
U||   magnificent. Once I was myself a decorist; but that sublimation of
U||   folly has palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for my
U||   purpose. Like these arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire,
U||   and the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions
U||   of that land of real dreams whither I am now rapidly departing.” He
U||   here paused abruptly, bent his head to his bosom, and seemed to listen
U||   to a sound which I could not hear. At length, erecting his frame, he
U||   looked upwards, and ejaculated the lines of the Bishop of Chichester:
U||   “Stay for me there! I will not fail
U||   To meet thee in that hollow vale.”
U||   In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw himself
U||   at full-length upon an ottoman.
U||   A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock at the
U||   door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a second
U||   disturbance, when a page of Mentoni’s household burst into the room,
U||   and faltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the incoherent
U||   words, “My mistress!—my mistress!—Poisoned!—poisoned! Oh, beautiful—oh,
U||   beautiful Aphrodite!”
U||   Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the sleeper
U||   to a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs were rigid—his
U||   lips were livid—his lately beaming eyes were riveted in death. I
U||   staggered back towards the table—my hand fell upon a cracked and
U||   blackened goblet—and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth
U||   flashed suddenly over my soul.
U||THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM
U||   Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores
U||   Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.
U||   Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,
U||   Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.
U||   [Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the
U||   site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris.]
U||   I was sick—sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at
U||   length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses
U||   were leaving me. The sentence—the dread sentence of death—was the last
U||   of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound
U||   of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate
U||   hum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution—perhaps from its
U||   association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a
U||   brief period, for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I
U||   saw—but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the
U||   black-robed judges. They appeared to me white—whiter than the sheet
U||   upon which I trace these words—and thin even to grotesqueness; thin
U||   with the intensity of their expression of firmness—of immoveable
U||   resolution—of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees
U||   of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them
U||   writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my
U||   name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few
U||   moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving
U||   of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And
U||   then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At
U||   first they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender
U||   angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a most
U||   deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill
U||   as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel
U||   forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that
U||   from them there would be no help. And then there stole into my fancy,
U||   like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be
U||   in the grave. The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed
U||   long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came
U||   at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges
U||   vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into
U||   nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of darkness
U||   supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing
U||   descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and stillness, night
U||   were the universe.
U||   I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was
U||   lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even
U||   to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber—no! In
U||   delirium—no! In a swoon—no! In death—no! even in the grave all is not
U||   lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the most
U||   profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a
U||   second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not
U||   that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are
U||   two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly,
U||   that of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if,
U||   upon reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the
U||   first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the
U||   gulf beyond. And that gulf is—what? How at least shall we distinguish
U||   its shadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I
U||   have termed the first stage are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long
U||   interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come?
U||   He who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and
U||   wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds
U||   floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not
U||   he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower; is not he whose
U||   brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which
U||   has never before arrested his attention.
U||   Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest
U||   struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness
U||   into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have
U||   dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I
U||   have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch
U||   assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming
U||   unconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall
U||   figures that lifted and bore me in silence down—down—still down—till a
U||   hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness
U||   of the descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on
U||   account of that heart’s unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of
U||   sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a
U||   ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the
U||   limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After this
U||   I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness—the
U||   madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.
U||   Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound—the
U||   tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its
U||   beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and
U||   motion, and touch—a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the
U||   mere consciousness of existence, without thought—a condition which
U||   lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and
U||   earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire to
U||   lapse into insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a
U||   successful effort to move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the
U||   judges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of
U||   the swoon. Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that
U||   a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to
U||   recall.
U||   So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back,
U||   unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp
U||   and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I
U||   strove to imagine where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to
U||   employ my vision. I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It
U||   was not that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew
U||   aghast lest there should be nothing to see. At length, with a wild
U||   desperation at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts,
U||   then, were confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I
U||   struggled for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress
U||   and stifle me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay
U||   quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the
U||   inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my
U||   real condition. The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a
U||   very long interval of time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did
U||   I suppose myself actually dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding
U||   what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real
U||   existence;—but where and in what state was I? The condemned to death, I
U||   knew, perished usually at the autos-da-fe, and one of these had been
U||   held on the very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to
U||   my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for
U||   many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had been in
U||   immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned
U||   cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether
U||   excluded.
U||   A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart,
U||   and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon
U||   recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in
U||   every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all
U||   directions. I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should
U||   be impeded by the walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore,
U||   and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense
U||   grew at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my
U||   arms extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of
U||   catching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces; but still
U||   all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed
U||   evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.
U||   And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came
U||   thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors
U||   of Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things
U||   narrated—fables I had always deemed them—but yet strange, and too
U||   ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper. Was I left to perish of
U||   starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or what fate,
U||   perhaps even more fearful, awaited me? That the result would be death,
U||   and a death of more than customary bitterness, I knew too well the
U||   character of my judges to doubt. The mode and the hour were all that
U||   occupied or distracted me.
U||   My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It
U||   was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry—very smooth, slimy, and cold. I
U||   followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which
U||   certain antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however,
U||   afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I
U||   might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out,
U||   without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.
U||   I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led into
U||   the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been
U||   exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the
U||   blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point
U||   of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although,
U||   in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable. I tore a
U||   part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length,
U||   and at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison, I
U||   could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So,
U||   at least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the
U||   dungeon, or upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I
U||   staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My excessive
U||   fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I
U||   lay.
U||   Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and
U||   a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this
U||   circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I
U||   resumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon
U||   the fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted
U||   fifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight
U||   more—when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred
U||   paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to
U||   be fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the
U||   wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault, for
U||   vault I could not help supposing it to be.
U||   I had little object—certainly no hope—in these researches; but a vague
U||   curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I resolved
U||   to cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with extreme
U||   caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was
U||   treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not
U||   hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as
U||   possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when
U||   the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my
U||   legs. I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.
U||   In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a
U||   somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,
U||   and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this: my
U||   chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper
U||   portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the
U||   chin, touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a
U||   clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my
U||   nostrils. I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen
U||   at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no
U||   means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just
U||   below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let
U||   it fall into the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its
U||   reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its
U||   descent; at length there was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by
U||   loud echoes. At the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick
U||   opening, and as rapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam
U||   of light flashed suddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded
U||   away.
U||   I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and
U||   congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped.
U||   Another step before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the
U||   death just avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as
U||   fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the
U||   victims of its tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst
U||   physical agonies, or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had
U||   been reserved for the latter. By long suffering my nerves had been
U||   unstrung, until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become
U||   in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which
U||   awaited me.
U||   Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall—resolving there
U||   to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my
U||   imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.
U||   In other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery
U||   at once by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the
U||   veriest of cowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these
U||   pits—that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most
U||   horrible plan.
U||   Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours, but at length I
U||   again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf
U||   and a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the
U||   vessel at a draught. It must have been drugged—for scarcely had I
U||   drunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me—a
U||   sleep like that of death. How long it lasted of course, I know not; but
U||   when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were
U||   visible. By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not
U||   at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the
U||   prison.
U||   In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls
U||   did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned
U||   me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less
U||   importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then
U||   the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in
U||   trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I
U||   had committed in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me.
U||   In my first attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to
U||   the period when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of
U||   the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of
U||   the vault. I then slept—and, upon awaking, I must have returned upon my
U||   steps—thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My
U||   confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with
U||   the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.
U||   I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure. In
U||   feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of
U||   great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one
U||   arousing from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few
U||   slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of
U||   the prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be
U||   iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints
U||   occasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic
U||   enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to
U||   which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures
U||   of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more
U||   really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed
U||   that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct,
U||   but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of
U||   a damp atmosphere. I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In
U||   the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but
U||   it was the only one in the dungeon.
U||   All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort—for my personal
U||   condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my
U||   back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To
U||   this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It
U||   passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty
U||   only my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of
U||   much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay
U||   by my side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been
U||   removed. I say to my horror—for I was consumed with intolerable thirst.
U||   This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to
U||   stimulate—for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.
U||   Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty
U||   or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one
U||   of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was
U||   the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in
U||   lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be
U||   the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.
U||   There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which
U||   caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward
U||   at it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I
U||   saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its
U||   sweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes,
U||   somewhat in fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing
U||   its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.
U||   A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw
U||   several enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well,
U||   which lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they
U||   came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent
U||   of the meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare
U||   them away.
U||   It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could
U||   take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward.
U||   What I then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had
U||   increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its
U||   velocity was also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the
U||   idea that had perceptibly descended. I now observed—with what horror it
U||   is needless to say—that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent
U||   of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the
U||   horns upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor.
U||   Like a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge
U||   into a solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty
U||   rod of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.
U||   I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity
U||   in torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the
U||   inquisitorial agents—the pit, whose horrors had been destined for so
U||   bold a recusant as myself—the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by
U||   rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into
U||   this pit I had avoided by the merest of accidents, I knew that
U||   surprise, or entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of
U||   all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it
U||   was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus
U||   (there being no alternative) a different and a milder destruction
U||   awaited me. Milder! I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such
U||   application of such a term.
U||   What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than
U||   mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel!
U||   Inch by inch—line by line—with a descent only appreciable at intervals
U||   that seemed ages—down and still down it came! Days passed—it might have
U||   been that many days passed—ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me
U||   with its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into
U||   my nostrils. I prayed—I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more
U||   speedy descent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself
U||   upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell
U||   suddenly calm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at
U||   some rare bauble.
U||   There was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for,
U||   upon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in
U||   the pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons
U||   who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at
U||   pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very—oh! inexpressibly—sick and
U||   weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that
U||   period, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I
U||   outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took
U||   possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats.
U||   As I put a portion of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half
U||   formed thought of joy—of hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It
U||   was, as I say, a half formed thought—man has many such, which are never
U||   completed. I felt that it was of joy—of hope; but felt also that it had
U||   perished in its formation. In vain I struggled to perfect—to regain it.
U||   Long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I
U||   was an imbecile—an idiot.
U||   The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw
U||   that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart. It
U||   would fray the serge of my robe—it would return and repeat its
U||   operations—again—and again. Notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep
U||   (some thirty feet or more) and the hissing vigor of its descent,
U||   sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my
U||   robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish. And
U||   at this thought I paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection.
U||   I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention—as if, in so dwelling,
U||   I could arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to ponder
U||   upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the
U||   garment—upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of
U||   cloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this frivolity until
U||   my teeth were on edge.
U||   Down—steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting
U||   its downward with its lateral velocity. To the right—to the left—far
U||   and wide—with the shriek of a damned spirit! to my heart with the
U||   stealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and howled as the one
U||   or the other idea grew predominant.
U||   Down—certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches of
U||   my bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This
U||   was free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter,
U||   from the platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no
U||   farther. Could I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would
U||   have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have
U||   attempted to arrest an avalanche!
U||   Down—still unceasingly—still inevitably down! I gasped and struggled at
U||   each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My eyes
U||   followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most
U||   unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,
U||   although death would have been a relief, oh, how unspeakable! Still I
U||   quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery
U||   would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope
U||   that prompted the nerve to quiver—the frame to shrink. It was hope—the
U||   hope that triumphs on the rack—that whispers to the death-condemned
U||   even in the dungeons of the Inquisition.
U||   I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in
U||   actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly
U||   came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For
U||   the first time during many hours—or perhaps days—I thought. It now
U||   occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was
U||   unique. I was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the
U||   razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it
U||   that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But
U||   how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel! The result of
U||   the slightest struggle how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the
U||   minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this
U||   possibility? Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the
U||   track of the pendulum? Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my
U||   last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct
U||   view of my breast. The surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in
U||   all directions—save in the path of the destroying crescent.
U||   Scarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when
U||   there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the
U||   unformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously
U||   alluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my
U||   brain when I raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now
U||   present—feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite,—but still entire. I
U||   proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its
U||   execution.
U||   For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I
U||   lay had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold,
U||   ravenous—their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for
U||   motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. “To what food,” I
U||   thought, “have they been accustomed in the well?”
U||   They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but
U||   a small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an
U||   habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter; and, at
U||   length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of
U||   effect. In their voracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp
U||   fangs in my fingers. With the particles of the oily and spicy viand
U||   which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could
U||   reach it; then, raising my hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly
U||   still.
U||   At first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the
U||   change—at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many
U||   sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in
U||   vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained without motion, one
U||   or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the
U||   surcingle. This seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the
U||   well they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to the wood—they overran
U||   it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the
U||   pendulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied
U||   themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed—they swarmed upon me
U||   in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold
U||   lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure;
U||   disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and
U||   chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt
U||   that the struggle would be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of
U||   the bandage. I knew that in more than one place it must be already
U||   severed. With a more than human resolution I lay still.
U||   Nor had I erred in my calculations—nor had I endured in vain. I at
U||   length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my
U||   body. But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It
U||   had divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen
U||   beneath. Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through
U||   every nerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand
U||   my deliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady
U||   movement—cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow—I slid from the
U||   embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the
U||   moment, at least, I was free.
U||   Free!—and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped from
U||   my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the
U||   motion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some
U||   invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took
U||   desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!—I
U||   had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse
U||   than death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves nervously
U||   around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something
U||   unusual—some change which, at first, I could not appreciate
U||   distinctly—it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many
U||   minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain,
U||   unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the
U||   first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the
U||   cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width,
U||   extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which
U||   thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. I
U||   endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.
U||   As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the
U||   chamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that,
U||   although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently
U||   distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors
U||   had now assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most
U||   intense brilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures
U||   an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own.
U||   Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a
U||   thousand directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed
U||   with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination
U||   to regard as unreal.
U||   Unreal!—Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of
U||   the vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A
U||   deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies!
U||   A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of
U||   blood. I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the
U||   design of my tormentors—oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men!
U||   I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the
U||   thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the
U||   coolness of the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its
U||   deadly brink. I threw my straining vision below. The glare from the
U||   enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild moment,
U||   did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At length
U||   it forced—it wrestled its way into my soul—it burned itself in upon my
U||   shuddering reason. Oh! for a voice to speak!—oh! horror!—oh! any horror
U||   but this! With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face
U||   in my hands—weeping bitterly.
U||   The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as
U||   with a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell—and
U||   now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain
U||   that I, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was
U||   taking place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial
U||   vengeance had been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be
U||   no more dallying with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I
U||   saw that two of its iron angles were now acute—two, consequently,
U||   obtuse. The fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or
U||   moaning sound. In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into
U||   that of a lozenge. But the alteration stopped not here—I neither hoped
U||   nor desired it to stop. I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom
U||   as a garment of eternal peace. “Death,” I said, “any death but that of
U||   the pit!” Fool! might I have not known that into the pit it was the
U||   object of the burning iron to urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if
U||   even that, could I withstand its pressure? And now, flatter and flatter
U||   grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that left me no time for
U||   contemplation. Its centre, and of course, its greatest width, came just
U||   over the yawning gulf. I shrank back—but the closing walls pressed me
U||   resistlessly onward. At length for my seared and writhing body there
U||   was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison. I
U||   struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud,
U||   long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the
U||   brink—I averted my eyes—
U||   There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as
U||   of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders!
U||   The fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I
U||   fell, fainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The
U||   French army had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its
U||   enemies.
U||THE PREMATURE BURIAL
U||   There are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but
U||   which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction.
U||   These the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or
U||   to disgust. They are with propriety handled only when the severity and
U||   majesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example,
U||   with the most intense of “pleasurable pain” over the accounts of the
U||   Passage of the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at
U||   London, of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the
U||   hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But
U||   in these accounts it is the fact——it is the reality——it is the history
U||   which excites. As inventions, we should regard them with simple
U||   abhorrence.
U||   I have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities
U||   on record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character
U||   of the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not
U||   remind the reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human
U||   miseries, I might have selected many individual instances more replete
U||   with essential suffering than any of these vast generalities of
U||   disaster. The true wretchedness, indeed—the ultimate woe——is
U||   particular, not diffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured
U||   by man the unit, and never by man the mass——for this let us thank a
U||   merciful God!
U||   To be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of
U||   these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That
U||   it has frequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied
U||   by those who think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at
U||   best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the
U||   other begins? We know that there are diseases in which occur total
U||   cessations of all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which
U||   these cessations are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are
U||   only temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain
U||   period elapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in
U||   motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver cord was not
U||   for ever loosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken. But where,
U||   meantime, was the soul?
U||   Apart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that such
U||   causes must produce such effects——that the well-known occurrence of
U||   such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and
U||   then, to premature interments—apart from this consideration, we have
U||   the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a
U||   vast number of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer
U||   at once, if necessary, to a hundred well-authenticated instances. One
U||   of very remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be
U||   fresh in the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago,
U||   in the neighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful,
U||   intense, and widely-extended excitement. The wife of one of the most
U||   respectable citizens—a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress—was
U||   seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely
U||   baffled the skill of her physicians. After much suffering she died, or
U||   was supposed to die. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to
U||   suspect, that she was not actually dead. She presented all the ordinary
U||   appearances of death. The face assumed the usual pinched and sunken
U||   outline. The lips were of the usual marble pallor. The eyes were
U||   lustreless. There was no warmth. Pulsation had ceased. For three days
U||   the body was preserved unburied, during which it had acquired a stony
U||   rigidity. The funeral, in short, was hastened, on account of the rapid
U||   advance of what was supposed to be decomposition.
U||   The lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent
U||   years, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was opened
U||   for the reception of a sarcophagus; but, alas! how fearful a shock
U||   awaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As its
U||   portals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell
U||   rattling within his arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet
U||   unmoulded shroud.
U||   A careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within
U||   two days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had
U||   caused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so
U||   broken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentally
U||   left, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been
U||   exhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which
U||   led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin,
U||   with which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by
U||   striking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or
U||   possibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became
U||   entangled in some iron-work which projected interiorly. Thus she
U||   remained, and thus she rotted, erect.
U||   In the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France,
U||   attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that
U||   truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was a
U||   Mademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family,
U||   of wealth, and of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was
U||   Julien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris. His talents
U||   and general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the
U||   heiress, by whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of
U||   birth decided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur
U||   Renelle, a banker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage,
U||   however, this gentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively
U||   ill-treated her. Having passed with him some wretched years, she
U||   died—at least her condition so closely resembled death as to deceive
U||   every one who saw her. She was buried——not in a vault, but in an
U||   ordinary grave in the village of her nativity. Filled with despair, and
U||   still inflamed by the memory of a profound attachment, the lover
U||   journeys from the capital to the remote province in which the village
U||   lies, with the romantic purpose of disinterring the corpse, and
U||   possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses. He reaches the grave. At
U||   midnight he unearths the coffin, opens it, and is in the act of
U||   detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the unclosing of the beloved
U||   eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried alive. Vitality had not
U||   altogether departed, and she was aroused by the caresses of her lover
U||   from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death. He bore her
U||   frantically to his lodgings in the village. He employed certain
U||   powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical learning. In fine,
U||   she revived. She recognized her preserver. She remained with him until,
U||   by slow degrees, she fully recovered her original health. Her woman’s
U||   heart was not adamant, and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften
U||   it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet. She returned no more to her husband,
U||   but, concealing from him her resurrection, fled with her lover to
U||   America. Twenty years afterward, the two returned to France, in the
U||   persuasion that time had so greatly altered the lady’s appearance that
U||   her friends would be unable to recognize her. They were mistaken,
U||   however, for, at the first meeting, Monsieur Renelle did actually
U||   recognize and make claim to his wife. This claim she resisted, and a
U||   judicial tribunal sustained her in her resistance, deciding that the
U||   peculiar circumstances, with the long lapse of years, had extinguished,
U||   not only equitably, but legally, the authority of the husband.
U||   The “Chirurgical Journal” of Leipsic, a periodical of high authority
U||   and merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate
U||   and republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the
U||   character in question.
U||   An officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust
U||   health, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe
U||   contusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the
U||   skull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended.
U||   Trepanning was accomplished successfully. He was bled, and many other
U||   of the ordinary means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he
U||   fell into a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it
U||   was thought that he died.
U||   The weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of
U||   the public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the
U||   Sunday following, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much
U||   thronged with visitors, and about noon an intense excitement was
U||   created by the declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the
U||   grave of the officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth,
U||   as if occasioned by some one struggling beneath. At first little
U||   attention was paid to the man’s asseveration; but his evident terror,
U||   and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at
U||   length their natural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly
U||   procured, and the grave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few
U||   minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant appeared. He
U||   was then seemingly dead; but he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the
U||   lid of which, in his furious struggles, he had partially uplifted.
U||   He was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced
U||   to be still living, although in an asphytic condition. After some hours
U||   he revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken
U||   sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.
U||   From what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious of
U||   life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into
U||   insensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an
U||   exceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted. He
U||   heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make
U||   himself heard in turn. It was the tumult within the grounds of the
U||   cemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but
U||   no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors
U||   of his position.
U||   This patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair
U||   way of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of
U||   medical experiment. The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly
U||   expired in one of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it
U||   superinduces.
U||   The mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory
U||   a well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action
U||   proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London,
U||   who had been interred for two days. This occurred in 1831, and created,
U||   at the time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject
U||   of converse.
U||   The patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus
U||   fever, accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the
U||   curiosity of his medical attendants. Upon his seeming decease, his
U||   friends were requested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but
U||   declined to permit it. As often happens, when such refusals are made,
U||   the practitioners resolved to disinter the body and dissect it at
U||   leisure, in private. Arrangements were easily effected with some of the
U||   numerous corps of body-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon
U||   the third night after the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed
U||   from a grave eight feet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of
U||   one of the private hospitals.
U||   An incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen, when
U||   the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an
U||   application of the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and the
U||   customary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any
U||   respect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree
U||   of life-likeness in the convulsive action.
U||   It grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient,
U||   at length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A student, however,
U||   was especially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted
U||   upon applying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash
U||   was made, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with
U||   a hurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table,
U||   stepped into the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a
U||   few seconds, and then—spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words
U||   were uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell
U||   heavily to the floor.
U||   For some moments all were paralyzed with awe—but the urgency of the
U||   case soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen that Mr.
U||   Stapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether he
U||   revived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his
U||   friends—from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was
U||   withheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Their
U||   wonder—their rapturous astonishment—may be conceived.
U||   The most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is
U||   involved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no period
U||   was he altogether insensible—that, dully and confusedly, he was aware
U||   of everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was
U||   pronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to
U||   the floor of the hospital. “I am alive,” were the uncomprehended words
U||   which, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had
U||   endeavored, in his extremity, to utter.
U||   It were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these—but I
U||   forbear—for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact that
U||   premature interments occur. When we reflect how very rarely, from the
U||   nature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must
U||   admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely,
U||   in truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any
U||   great extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest
U||   the most fearful of suspicions.
U||   Fearful indeed the suspicion—but more fearful the doom! It may be
U||   asserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted
U||   to inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is
U||   burial before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs—the
U||   stifling fumes from the damp earth—the clinging to the death
U||   garments—the rigid embrace of the narrow house—the blackness of the
U||   absolute Night—the silence like a sea that overwhelms—the unseen but
U||   palpable presence of the Conqueror Worm—these things, with the thoughts
U||   of the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly
U||   to save us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of
U||   this fate they can never be informed—that our hopeless portion is that
U||   of the really dead—these considerations, I say, carry into the heart,
U||   which still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror
U||   from which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of nothing
U||   so agonizing upon Earth—we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the
U||   realms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon this topic
U||   have an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through
U||   the sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly
U||   depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. What I
U||   have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge—of my own positive and
U||   personal experience.
U||   For several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular
U||   disorder which physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of
U||   a more definitive title. Although both the immediate and the
U||   predisposing causes, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are
U||   still mysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently
U||   well understood. Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes
U||   the patient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a
U||   species of exaggerated lethargy. He is senseless and externally
U||   motionless; but the pulsation of the heart is still faintly
U||   perceptible; some traces of warmth remain; a slight color lingers
U||   within the centre of the cheek; and, upon application of a mirror to
U||   the lips, we can detect a torpid, unequal, and vacillating action of
U||   the lungs. Then again the duration of the trance is for weeks—even for
U||   months; while the closest scrutiny, and the most rigorous medical
U||   tests, fail to establish any material distinction between the state of
U||   the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death. Very usually he is
U||   saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends
U||   that he has been previously subject to catalepsy, by the consequent
U||   suspicion excited, and, above all, by the non-appearance of decay. The
U||   advances of the malady are, luckily, gradual. The first manifestations,
U||   although marked, are unequivocal. The fits grow successively more and
U||   more distinctive, and endure each for a longer term than the preceding.
U||   In this lies the principal security from inhumation. The unfortunate
U||   whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is
U||   occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the
U||   tomb.
U||   My own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in
U||   medical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by
U||   little, into a condition of semi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this
U||   condition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly
U||   speaking, to think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and
U||   of the presence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the
U||   crisis of the disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At
U||   other times I was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and
U||   numb, and chilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for
U||   weeks, all was void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the
U||   universe. Total annihilation could be no more. From these latter
U||   attacks I awoke, however, with a gradation slow in proportion to the
U||   suddenness of the seizure. Just as the day dawns to the friendless and
U||   houseless beggar who roams the streets throughout the long desolate
U||   winter night—just so tardily—just so wearily—just so cheerily came back
U||   the light of the Soul to me.
U||   Apart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared
U||   to be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one
U||   prevalent malady—unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep
U||   may be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could
U||   never gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always
U||   remained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity—the
U||   mental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a
U||   condition of absolute abeyance.
U||   In all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral
U||   distress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked “of worms, of
U||   tombs, and epitaphs.” I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea of
U||   premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastly
U||   Danger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. In the
U||   former, the torture of meditation was excessive—in the latter, supreme.
U||   When the grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of
U||   thought, I shook—shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When
U||   Nature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that
U||   I consented to sleep—for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I
U||   might find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank into
U||   slumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above
U||   which, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the
U||   one sepulchral Idea.
U||   From the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams,
U||   I select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was immersed in
U||   a cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity.
U||   Suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient,
U||   gibbering voice whispered the word “Arise!” within my ear.
U||   I sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure of him
U||   who had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the period at which I
U||   had fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. While
U||   I remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought,
U||   the cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly,
U||   while the gibbering voice said again:
U||   “Arise! did I not bid thee arise?”
U||   “And who,” I demanded, “art thou?”
U||   “I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,” replied the voice,
U||   mournfully; “I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless, but am
U||   pitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder. My teeth chatter as I speak,
U||   yet it is not with the chilliness of the night—of the night without
U||   end. But this hideousness is insufferable. How canst thou tranquilly
U||   sleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sights
U||   are more than I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outer
U||   Night, and let me unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a spectacle of
U||   woe?—Behold!”
U||   I looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist,
U||   had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind; and from each
U||   issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay; so that I could see into
U||   the innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad
U||   and solemn slumbers with the worm. But alas! the real sleepers were
U||   fewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there
U||   was a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from
U||   out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling
U||   from the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed tranquilly to
U||   repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less
U||   degree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been
U||   entombed. And the voice again said to me as I gazed:
U||   “Is it not—oh! is it not a pitiful sight?” But, before I could find
U||   words to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoric
U||   lights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence,
U||   while from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again:
U||   “Is it not—O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight?”
U||   Phantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended
U||   their terrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became
U||   thoroughly unstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated
U||   to ride, or to walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me
U||   from home. In fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate
U||   presence of those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest,
U||   falling into one of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real
U||   condition could be ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my
U||   dearest friends. I dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary
U||   duration, they might be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I
U||   even went so far as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they
U||   might be glad to consider any very protracted attack as sufficient
U||   excuse for getting rid of me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored
U||   to reassure me by the most solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred
U||   oaths, that under no circumstances they would bury me until
U||   decomposition had so materially advanced as to render farther
U||   preservation impossible. And, even then, my mortal terrors would listen
U||   to no reason—would accept no consolation. I entered into a series of
U||   elaborate precautions. Among other things, I had the family vault so
U||   remodelled as to admit of being readily opened from within. The
U||   slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb
U||   would cause the iron portal to fly back. There were arrangements also
U||   for the free admission of air and light, and convenient receptacles for
U||   food and water, within immediate reach of the coffin intended for my
U||   reception. This coffin was warmly and softly padded, and was provided
U||   with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the vault-door, with the
U||   addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body
U||   would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides all this, there was
U||   suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell, the rope of which,
U||   it was designed, should extend through a hole in the coffin, and so be
U||   fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas? what avails the
U||   vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these well-contrived
U||   securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living
U||   inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!
U||   There arrived an epoch—as often before there had arrived—in which I
U||   found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble
U||   and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly—with a tortoise
U||   gradation—approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A torpid
U||   uneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care—no hope—no
U||   effort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then, after
U||   a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the
U||   extremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence,
U||   during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a
U||   brief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the
U||   slight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric
U||   shock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in
U||   torrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive
U||   effort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a
U||   partial and evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained
U||   its dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel
U||   that I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been
U||   subject to catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean,
U||   my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger—by the one
U||   spectral and ever-prevalent idea.
U||   For some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without
U||   motion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I dared not make
U||   the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate—and yet there was
U||   something at my heart which whispered me it was sure. Despair—such as
U||   no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being—despair alone
U||   urged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes.
U||   I uplifted them. It was dark—all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I
U||   knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I had
U||   now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties—and yet it was
U||   dark—all dark—the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that
U||   endureth for evermore.
U||   I endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved
U||   convulsively together in the attempt—but no voice issued from the
U||   cavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent
U||   mountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and
U||   struggling inspiration.
U||   The movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that
U||   they were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too, that I lay
U||   upon some hard substance; and by something similar my sides were, also,
U||   closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my
U||   limbs—but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at
U||   length, with the wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden substance,
U||   which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six
U||   inches from my face. I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a
U||   coffin at last.
U||   And now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub
U||   Hope—for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodic
U||   exertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I felt my wrists
U||   for the bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now the Comforter fled
U||   for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could
U||   not help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so
U||   carefully prepared—and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils
U||   the strong peculiar odor of moist earth. The conclusion was
U||   irresistible. I was not within the vault. I had fallen into a trance
U||   while absent from home—while among strangers—when, or how, I could not
U||   remember—and it was they who had buried me as a dog—nailed up in some
U||   common coffin—and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary
U||   and nameless grave.
U||   As this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost
U||   chambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in this
U||   second endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or
U||   yell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.
U||   “Hillo! hillo, there!” said a gruff voice, in reply.
U||   “What the devil’s the matter now!” said a second.
U||   “Get out o’ that!” said a third.
U||   “What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a
U||   cattymount?” said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken
U||   without ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking
U||   individuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber—for I was wide
U||   awake when I screamed—but they restored me to the full possession of my
U||   memory.
U||   This adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by a
U||   friend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the
U||   banks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by a
U||   storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and
U||   laden with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We
U||   made the best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of
U||   the only two berths in the vessel—and the berths of a sloop of sixty or
U||   twenty tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no
U||   bedding of any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The
U||   distance of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I
U||   found it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in.
U||   Nevertheless, I slept soundly, and the whole of my vision—for it was no
U||   dream, and no nightmare—arose naturally from the circumstances of my
U||   position—from my ordinary bias of thought—and from the difficulty, to
U||   which I have alluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of
U||   regaining my memory, for a long time after awaking from slumber. The
U||   men who shook me were the crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged
U||   to unload it. From the load itself came the earthly smell. The bandage
U||   about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head,
U||   in default of my customary nightcap.
U||   The tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the
U||   time, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully—they were
U||   inconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very
U||   excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired
U||   tone—acquired temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I
U||   breathed the free air of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than
U||   Death. I discarded my medical books. “Buchan” I burned. I read no
U||   “Night Thoughts”—no fustian about churchyards—no bugaboo tales—such as
U||   this. In short, I became a new man, and lived a man’s life. From that
U||   memorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with
U||   them vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been
U||   less the consequence than the cause.
U||   There are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of
U||   our sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell—but the imagination
U||   of man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas!
U||   the grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether
U||   fanciful—but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage
U||   down the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us—they must be
U||   suffered to slumber, or we perish.
U||THE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM
U||   The garden like a lady fair was cut,
U||       That lay as if she slumbered in delight,
U||   And to the open skies her eyes did shut.
U||       The azure fields of Heaven were ’sembled right
U||       In a large round, set with the flowers of light.
U||   The flowers de luce, and the round sparks of dew
U||   That hung upon their azure leaves did shew
U||   Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.
U||                       —Giles Fletcher.
U||   From his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend
U||   Ellison along. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly
U||   sense. I mean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom I
U||   speak seemed born for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of
U||   Turgot, Price, Priestley, and Condorcet—of exemplifying by individual
U||   instance what has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists. In the
U||   brief existence of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma,
U||   that in man’s very nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of
U||   bliss. An anxious examination of his career has given me to understand
U||   that in general, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity
U||   arises the wretchedness of mankind—that as a species we have in our
U||   possession the as yet unwrought elements of content—and that, even now,
U||   in the present darkness and madness of all thought on the great
U||   question of the social condition, it is not impossible that man, the
U||   individual, under certain unusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may
U||   be happy.
U||   With opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully imbued, and
U||   thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which
U||   distinguished his life was, in great measure, the result of preconcert.
U||   It is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy
U||   which, now and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr.
U||   Ellison would have found himself precipitated, by the very
U||   extraordinary success of his life, into the common vortex of
U||   unhappiness which yawns for those of pre-eminent endowments. But it is
U||   by no means my object to pen an essay on happiness. The ideas of my
U||   friend may be summed up in a few words. He admitted but four elementary
U||   principles, or more strictly, conditions of bliss. That which he
U||   considered chief was (strange to say!) the simple and purely physical
U||   one of free exercise in the open air. “The health,” he said,
U||   “attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name.” He instanced
U||   the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to the tillers of the
U||   earth, the only people who, as a class, can be fairly considered
U||   happier than others. His second condition was the love of woman. His
U||   third, and most difficult of realization, was the contempt of ambition.
U||   His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held that, other
U||   things being equal, the extent of attainable happiness was in
U||   proportion to the spirituality of this object.
U||   Ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts
U||   lavished upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he exceeded
U||   all men. His intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of
U||   knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity. His family
U||   was one of the most illustrious of the empire. His bride was the
U||   loveliest and most devoted of women. His possessions had been always
U||   ample; but on the attainment of his majority, it was discovered that
U||   one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf
U||   which startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom
U||   fail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their
U||   objects.
U||   It appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison’s coming of
U||   age, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison.
U||   This gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no immediate
U||   connections, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate
U||   for a century after his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the
U||   various modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the
U||   nearest of blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at
U||   the end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set aside
U||   this singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them
U||   abortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a
U||   legislative act finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations.
U||   This act, however, did not prevent young Ellison from entering into
U||   possession, on his twenty-first birthday, as the heir of his ancestor
U||   Seabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.
U||   (*1)
U||   When it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited,
U||   there were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its
U||   disposal. The magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum
U||   bewildered all who thought on the topic. The possessor of any
U||   appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one
U||   of a thousand things. With riches merely surpassing those of any
U||   citizen, it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme
U||   excess in the fashionable extravagances of his time—or busying himself
U||   with political intrigue—or aiming at ministerial power—or purchasing
U||   increase of nobility—or collecting large museums of virtu—or playing
U||   the munificent patron of letters, of science, of art—or endowing, and
U||   bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But for the
U||   inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir, these
U||   objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a
U||   field. Recourse was had to figures, and these but sufficed to confound.
U||   It was seen that, even at three per cent., the annual income of the
U||   inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred
U||   thousand dollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five
U||   thousand per month; or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six
U||   per day; or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six
U||   and twenty dollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track of
U||   supposition was thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to imagine.
U||   There were some who even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest
U||   himself of at least one-half of his fortune, as of utterly superfluous
U||   opulence—enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his
U||   superabundance. To the nearest of these he did, in fact, abandon the
U||   very unusual wealth which was his own before the inheritance.
U||   I was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his
U||   mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.
U||   Nor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. In regard
U||   to individual charities he had satisfied his conscience. In the
U||   possibility of any improvement, properly so called, being effected by
U||   man himself in the general condition of man, he had (I am sorry to
U||   confess it) little faith. Upon the whole, whether happily or unhappily,
U||   he was thrown back, in very great measure, upon self.
U||   In the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended,
U||   moreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and
U||   dignity of the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not the sole proper
U||   satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the
U||   creation of novel forms of beauty. Some peculiarities, either in his
U||   early education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged with
U||   what is termed materialism all his ethical speculations; and it was
U||   this bias, perhaps, which led him to believe that the most advantageous
U||   at least, if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise,
U||   lies in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus
U||   it happened he became neither musician nor poet—if we use this latter
U||   term in its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that he
U||   neglected to become either, merely in pursuance of his idea that in
U||   contempt of ambition is to be found one of the essential principles of
U||   happiness on earth. Is it not indeed, possible that, while a high order
U||   of genius is necessarily ambitious, the highest is above that which is
U||   termed ambition? And may it not thus happen that many far greater than
U||   Milton have contentedly remained “mute and inglorious?” I believe that
U||   the world has never seen—and that, unless through some series of
U||   accidents goading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion,
U||   the world will never see—that full extent of triumphant execution, in
U||   the richer domains of art, of which the human nature is absolutely
U||   capable.
U||   Ellison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more
U||   profoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other circumstances than
U||   those which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have
U||   become a painter. Sculpture, although in its nature rigorously poetical
U||   was too limited in its extent and consequences, to have occupied, at
U||   any time, much of his attention. And I have now mentioned all the
U||   provinces in which the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has
U||   declared it capable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the
U||   richest, the truest, and most natural, if not altogether the most
U||   extensive province, had been unaccountably neglected. No definition had
U||   spoken of the landscape-gardener as of the poet; yet it seemed to my
U||   friend that the creation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper
U||   Muse the most magnificent of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the
U||   fairest field for the display of imagination in the endless combining
U||   of forms of novel beauty; the elements to enter into combination being,
U||   by a vast superiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford.
U||   In the multiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he
U||   recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of Nature at physical
U||   loveliness. And in the direction or concentration of this effort—or,
U||   more properly, in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on
U||   earth—he perceived that he should be employing the best means—laboring
U||   to the greatest advantage—in the fulfilment, not only of his own
U||   destiny as poet, but of the august purposes for which the Deity had
U||   implanted the poetic sentiment in man.
U||   “Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.” In his
U||   explanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward solving
U||   what has always seemed to me an enigma:—I mean the fact (which none but
U||   the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of scenery exists in
U||   nature as the painter of genius may produce. No such paradises are to
U||   be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of Claude. In the most
U||   enchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect
U||   or an excess—many excesses and defects. While the component parts may
U||   defy, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement of
U||   these parts will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no
U||   position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth, from
U||   which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of
U||   offence in what is termed the “composition” of the landscape. And yet
U||   how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are justly
U||   instructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details we shrink from
U||   competition. Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or
U||   to improve the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism
U||   which says, of sculpture or portraiture, that here nature is to be
U||   exalted or idealized rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or
U||   sculptural combinations of points of human liveliness do more than
U||   approach the living and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the
U||   principle of the critic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is
U||   but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to
U||   pronounce it true throughout all the domains of art. Having, I say,
U||   felt its truth here; for the feeling is no affectation or chimera. The
U||   mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments
U||   of his art yields the artist. He not only believes, but positively
U||   knows, that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter
U||   constitute and alone constitute the true beauty. His reasons, however,
U||   have not yet been matured into expression. It remains for a more
U||   profound analysis than the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and
U||   express them. Nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions
U||   by the voice of all his brethren. Let a “composition” be defective; let
U||   an emendation be wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this
U||   emendation be submitted to every artist in the world; by each will its
U||   necessity be admitted. And even far more than this; in remedy of the
U||   defective composition, each insulated member of the fraternity would
U||   have suggested the identical emendation.
U||   I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature
U||   susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility of
U||   improvement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to
U||   solve. My own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the
U||   primitive intention of nature would have so arranged the earth’s
U||   surface as to have fulfilled at all points man’s sense of perfection in
U||   the beautiful, the sublime, or the picturesque; but that this primitive
U||   intention had been frustrated by the known geological
U||   disturbances—disturbances of form and color—grouping, in the correction
U||   or allaying of which lies the soul of art. The force of this idea was
U||   much weakened, however, by the necessity which it involved of
U||   considering the disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose. It
U||   was Ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death. He thus
U||   explained:—Admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the first
U||   intention. We have then the primitive arrangement of the earth’s
U||   surface adapted to his blissful estate, as not existent but designed.
U||   The disturbances were the preparations for his subsequently conceived
U||   deathful condition.
U||   “Now,” said my friend, “what we regard as exaltation of the landscape
U||   may be really such, as respects only the moral or human point of view.
U||   Each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish in
U||   the picture, if we can suppose this picture viewed at large—in
U||   mass—from some point distant from the earth’s surface, although not
U||   beyond the limits of its atmosphere. It is easily understood that what
U||   might improve a closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure
U||   a general or more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of
U||   beings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar,
U||   our disorder may seem order—our unpicturesqueness picturesque; in a
U||   word, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more especially than our
U||   own, and for whose death-refined appreciation of the beautiful, may
U||   have been set in array by God the wide landscape-gardens of the
U||   hemispheres.”
U||   In the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from a
U||   writer on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have well
U||   treated his theme:
U||   “There are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural
U||   and the artificial. One seeks to recall the original beauty of the
U||   country, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivating
U||   trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land;
U||   detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size,
U||   proportion, and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed
U||   everywhere to the experienced student of nature. The result of the
U||   natural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all
U||   defects and incongruities—in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and
U||   order—than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. The
U||   artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to
U||   gratify. It has a certain general relation to the various styles of
U||   building. There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles;
U||   Italian terraces; and a various mixed old English style, which bears
U||   some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan
U||   architecture. Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial
U||   landscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it
U||   a great beauty. This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of
U||   order and design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered
U||   balustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed
U||   there in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of
U||   care and human interest.”
U||   “From what I have already observed,” said Ellison, “you will understand
U||   that I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling the original
U||   beauty of the country. The original beauty is never so great as that
U||   which may be introduced. Of course, every thing depends on the
U||   selection of a spot with capabilities. What is said about detecting and
U||   bringing into practice nice relations of size, proportion, and color,
U||   is one of those mere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil
U||   inaccuracy of thought. The phrase quoted may mean any thing, or
U||   nothing, and guides in no degree. That the true result of the natural
U||   style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and
U||   incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles,
U||   is a proposition better suited to the grovelling apprehension of the
U||   herd than to the fervid dreams of the man of genius. The negative merit
U||   suggested appertains to that hobbling criticism which, in letters,
U||   would elevate Addison into apotheosis. In truth, while that virtue
U||   which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals directly to the
U||   understanding, and can thus be circumscribed in rule, the loftier
U||   virtue, which flames in creation, can be apprehended in its results
U||   alone. Rule applies but to the merits of denial—to the excellencies
U||   which refrain. Beyond these, the critical art can but suggest. We may
U||   be instructed to build a “Cato,” but we are in vain told how to
U||   conceive a Parthenon or an “Inferno.” The thing done, however; the
U||   wonder accomplished; and the capacity for apprehension becomes
U||   universal. The sophists of the negative school who, through inability
U||   to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found the loudest in
U||   applause. What, in its chrysalis condition of principle, affronted
U||   their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of accomplishment, to
U||   extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.
U||   “The author’s observations on the artificial style,” continued Ellison,
U||   “are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds
U||   to it a great beauty. This is just; as also is the reference to the
U||   sense of human interest. The principle expressed is
U||   incontrovertible—but there may be something beyond it. There may be an
U||   object in keeping with the principle—an object unattainable by the
U||   means ordinarily possessed by individuals, yet which, if attained,
U||   would lend a charm to the landscape-garden far surpassing that which a
U||   sense of merely human interest could bestow. A poet, having very
U||   unusual pecuniary resources, might, while retaining the necessary idea
U||   of art or culture, or, as our author expresses it, of interest, so
U||   imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty, as to
U||   convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. It will be seen that,
U||   in bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of
U||   interest or design, while relieving his work of the harshness or
U||   technicality of the worldly art. In the most rugged of wildernesses—in
U||   the most savage of the scenes of pure nature—there is apparent the art
U||   of a creator; yet this art is apparent to reflection only; in no
U||   respect has it the obvious force of a feeling. Now let us suppose this
U||   sense of the Almighty design to be one step depressed—to be brought
U||   into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of human
U||   art—to form an intermedium between the two:—let us imagine, for
U||   example, a landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness—whose
U||   united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness, shall convey the idea of
U||   care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part of beings superior,
U||   yet akin to humanity—then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while
U||   the art intervolved is made to assume the air of an intermediate or
U||   secondary nature—a nature which is not God, nor an emanation from God,
U||   but which still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels
U||   that hover between man and God.”
U||   It was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision
U||   such as this—in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the
U||   personal superintendence of his plans—in the unceasing object which
U||   these plans afforded—in the high spirituality of the object—in the
U||   contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel—in the
U||   perennial springs with which it gratified, without possibility of
U||   satiating, that one master passion of his soul, the thirst for beauty,
U||   above all, it was in the sympathy of a woman, not unwomanly, whose
U||   loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of
U||   Paradise, that Ellison thought to find, and found, exemption from the
U||   ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positive
U||   happiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Staël.
U||   I despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the
U||   marvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to describe,
U||   but am disheartened by the difficulty of description, and hesitate
U||   between detail and generality. Perhaps the better course will be to
U||   unite the two in their extremes.
U||   Mr. Ellison’s first step regarded, of course, the choice of a locality,
U||   and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point, when the
U||   luxuriant nature of the Pacific Islands arrested his attention. In
U||   fact, he had made up his mind for a voyage to the South Seas, when a
U||   night’s reflection induced him to abandon the idea. “Were I
U||   misanthropic,” he said, “such a locale would suit me. The thoroughness
U||   of its insulation and seclusion, and the difficulty of ingress and
U||   egress, would in such case be the charm of charms; but as yet I am not
U||   Timon. I wish the composure but not the depression of solitude. There
U||   must remain with me a certain control over the extent and duration of
U||   my repose. There will be frequent hours in which I shall need, too, the
U||   sympathy of the poetic in what I have done. Let me seek, then, a spot
U||   not far from a populous city—whose vicinity, also, will best enable me
U||   to execute my plans.”
U||   In search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for
U||   several years, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand spots
U||   with which I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation, for reasons
U||   which satisfied me, in the end, that he was right. We came at length to
U||   an elevated table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty, affording a
U||   panoramic prospect very little less in extent than that of Aetna, and,
U||   in Ellison’s opinion as well as my own, surpassing the far-famed view
U||   from that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.
U||   “I am aware,” said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep delight
U||   after gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an hour, “I know that
U||   here, in my circumstances, nine-tenths of the most fastidious of men
U||   would rest content. This panorama is indeed glorious, and I should
U||   rejoice in it but for the excess of its glory. The taste of all the
U||   architects I have ever known leads them, for the sake of ‘prospect,’ to
U||   put up buildings on hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of
U||   its moods, but especially in that of extent, startles, excites—and then
U||   fatigues, depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be better—for
U||   the constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant view, the most
U||   objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent; the worst phase of
U||   extent, that of distance. It is at war with the sentiment and with the
U||   sense of seclusion—the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in
U||   ‘retiring to the country.’ In looking from the summit of a mountain we
U||   cannot help feeling abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant
U||   prospects as a pestilence.”
U||   It was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that
U||   we found a locality with which Ellison professed himself satisfied. It
U||   is, of course, needless to say where was the locality. The late death
U||   of my friend, in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain
U||   classes of visitors, has given to Arnheim a species of secret and
U||   subdued if not solemn celebrity, similar in kind, although infinitely
U||   superior in degree, to that which so long distinguished Fonthill.
U||   The usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visitor left the
U||   city in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed between shores
U||   of a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed innumerable sheep,
U||   their white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. By
U||   degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral
U||   care. This slowly became merged in a sense of retirement—this again in
U||   a consciousness of solitude. As the evening approached, the channel
U||   grew more narrow; the banks more and more precipitous; and these latter
U||   were clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water
U||   increased in transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at
U||   no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance
U||   than a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an
U||   enchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage,
U||   a roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor—the keel balancing itself
U||   with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accident
U||   having been turned upside down, floated in constant company with the
U||   substantial one, for the purpose of sustaining it. The channel now
U||   became a gorge—although the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ
U||   it merely because the language has no word which better represents the
U||   most striking—not the most distinctive—feature of the scene. The
U||   character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of
U||   the shores; it was lost altogether in their other traits. The walls of
U||   the ravine (through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed)
U||   arose to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and
U||   fifty feet, and inclined so much toward each other as, in a great
U||   measure, to shut out the light of day; while the long plume-like moss
U||   which depended densely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave
U||   the whole chasm an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more
U||   frequent and intricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon
U||   themselves, so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He
U||   was, moreover, enwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The
U||   thought of nature still remained, but her character seemed to have
U||   undergone modification, there was a weird symmetry, a thrilling
U||   uniformity, a wizard propriety in these her works. Not a dead
U||   branch—not a withered leaf—not a stray pebble—not a patch of the brown
U||   earth was anywhere visible. The crystal water welled up against the
U||   clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with a sharpness of outline
U||   that delighted while it bewildered the eye.
U||   Having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloom
U||   deepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel
U||   brought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin
U||   of very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge.
U||   It was about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points
U||   but one—that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered—by hills
U||   equal in general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a
U||   thoroughly different character. Their sides sloped from the water’s
U||   edge at an angle of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from
U||   base to summit—not a perceptible point escaping—in a drapery of the
U||   most gorgeous flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible
U||   among the sea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great
U||   depth, but so transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed
U||   to consist of a thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was
U||   distinctly visible by glimpses—that is to say, whenever the eye could
U||   permit itself not to see, far down in the inverted heaven, the
U||   duplicate blooming of the hills. On these latter there were no trees,
U||   nor even shrubs of any size. The impressions wrought on the observer
U||   were those of richness, warmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness,
U||   delicacy, daintiness, voluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of
U||   culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies, laborious,
U||   tasteful, magnificent, and fastidious; but as the eye traced upward the
U||   myriad-tinted slope, from its sharp junction with the water to its
U||   vague termination amid the folds of overhanging cloud, it became,
U||   indeed, difficult not to fancy a panoramic cataract of rubies,
U||   sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes, rolling silently out of the sky.
U||   The visitor, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the
U||   ravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining
U||   sun, which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but
U||   which now confronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise
U||   limitless vista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.
U||   But here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, and
U||   descends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices in
U||   vivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and beak of this boat
U||   arise high above the water, with sharp points, so that the general form
U||   is that of an irregular crescent. It lies on the surface of the bay
U||   with the proud grace of a swan. On its ermined floor reposes a single
U||   feathery paddle of satin-wood; but no oarsmen or attendant is to be
U||   seen. The guest is bidden to be of good cheer—that the fates will take
U||   care of him. The larger vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the
U||   canoe, which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake.
U||   While he considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of
U||   a gentle movement in the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around
U||   until its prow points toward the sun. It advances with a gentle but
U||   gradually accelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it creates
U||   seem to break about the ivory side in divinest melody—seem to offer the
U||   only possible explanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for
U||   whose unseen origin the bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.
U||   The canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is
U||   approached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To the
U||   right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded. It is
U||   observed, however, that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank
U||   dips into the water, still prevails. There is not one token of the
U||   usual river débris. To the left the character of the scene is softer
U||   and more obviously artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the
U||   stream in a very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a
U||   texture resembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of
U||   green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald.
U||   This plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching
U||   from the river-bank to a wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an
U||   infinity of curves, but following the general direction of the river,
U||   until lost in the distance to the westward. This wall is of one
U||   continuous rock, and has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the
U||   once rugged precipice of the stream’s southern bank, but no trace of
U||   the labor has been suffered to remain. The chiselled stone has the hue
U||   of ages, and is profusely overhung and overspread with the ivy, the
U||   coral honeysuckle, the eglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of
U||   the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by occasional
U||   trees of gigantic height, growing singly or in small groups, both along
U||   the plateau and in the domain behind the wall, but in close proximity
U||   to it; so that frequent limbs (of the black walnut especially) reach
U||   over and dip their pendent extremities into the water. Farther back
U||   within the domain, the vision is impeded by an impenetrable screen of
U||   foliage.
U||   These things are observed during the canoe’s gradual approach to what I
U||   have called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to this, however,
U||   its chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet from the bay is
U||   discovered to the left—in which direction the wall is also seen to
U||   sweep, still following the general course of the stream. Down this new
U||   opening the eye cannot penetrate very far; for the stream, accompanied
U||   by the wall, still bends to the left, until both are swallowed up by
U||   the leaves.
U||   The boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding channel; and
U||   here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite the
U||   wall in the straight vista. Lofty hills, rising occasionally into
U||   mountains, and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut
U||   in the scene.
U||   Floating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented, the
U||   voyager, after many short turns, finds his progress apparently barred
U||   by a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold, elaborately carved
U||   and fretted, and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast-sinking sun
U||   with an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in
U||   flames. This gate is inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to
U||   cross the river at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen
U||   that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive
U||   curve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a stream of
U||   considerable volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way,
U||   with a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight.
U||   The canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate. Its
U||   ponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded. The boat glides
U||   between them, and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre
U||   entirely begirt with purple mountains, whose bases are laved by a
U||   gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit. Meantime
U||   the whole Paradise of Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gush of
U||   entrancing melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet
U||   odor;—there is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall slender
U||   Eastern trees—bosky shrubberies—flocks of golden and crimson
U||   birds—lily-fringed lakes—meadows of violets, tulips, poppies,
U||   hyacinths, and tuberoses—long intertangled lines of silver
U||   streamlets—and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass of
U||   semi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle
U||   in mid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels,
U||   minarets, and pinnacles; and seeming the phantom handiwork, conjointly,
U||   of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii and of the Gnomes.
U||LANDOR’S COTTAGE
U||   A Pendant to “The Domain of Arnheim”
U||   During A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river
U||   counties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat
U||   embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very
U||   remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about
U||   so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer
U||   knew in what direction lay the sweet village of B——, where I had
U||   determined to stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone—strictly
U||   speaking—during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly
U||   warm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all
U||   things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much
U||   about the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or
U||   even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch
U||   farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its
U||   appearance—although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of
U||   being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At
U||   all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a
U||   bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me.
U||   I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease—Ponto taking charge of my
U||   gun—until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the
U||   numerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to be
U||   paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable
U||   carriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light
U||   wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown
U||   undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even
U||   to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon—the most aspiring vehicle,
U||   I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in being open through
U||   the wood—if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of
U||   light trees—and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks—bore
U||   no resemblance to any road I had before seen. The tracks of which I
U||   speak were but faintly perceptible—having been impressed upon the firm,
U||   yet pleasantly moist surface of—what looked more like green Genoese
U||   velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly—but grass such as we
U||   seldom see out of England—so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in
U||   color. Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route—not even a chip
U||   or dead twig. The stones that once obstructed the way had been
U||   carefully placed—not thrown—along the sides of the lane, so as to
U||   define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise,
U||   half-negligent, and wholly picturesque definition. Clumps of wild
U||   flowers grew everywhere, luxuriantly, in the interspaces.
U||   What to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art
U||   undoubtedly—that did not surprise me—all roads, in the ordinary sense,
U||   are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the
U||   mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might
U||   have been done here—with such natural “capabilities” (as they have it
U||   in the books on Landscape Gardening)—with very little labor and
U||   expense. No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which
U||   caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and
U||   down this fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered
U||   admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I gazed:
U||   an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had
U||   superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had been taken
U||   to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand,
U||   and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the
U||   other. There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines. The
U||   same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but not
U||   oftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was variety in
U||   uniformity. It was a piece of “composition,” in which the most
U||   fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an
U||   emendation.
U||   I had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, I
U||   continued in the same direction. The path was so serpentine, that at no
U||   moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in
U||   advance. Its character did not undergo any material change.
U||   Presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear—and in a few
U||   moments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly
U||   than hitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the
U||   foot of a gentle declivity just before me. I could see nothing
U||   distinctly on account of the mist which occupied all the little valley
U||   below. A gentle breeze, however, now arose, as the sun was about
U||   descending; and while I remained standing on the brow of the slope, the
U||   fog gradually became dissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the
U||   scene.
U||   As it came fully into view—thus gradually as I describe it—piece by
U||   piece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summit
U||   of a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of
U||   the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of
U||   “vanishing pictures.”
U||   By the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sun
U||   had made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as if with a
U||   slight chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaring
U||   with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the
U||   west. Suddenly, therefore—and as if by the hand of magic—this whole
U||   valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.
U||   The first coup d’œil, as the sun slid into the position described,
U||   impressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, by the
U||   concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or
U||   melodrama. Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the
U||   sunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple;
U||   while the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or
U||   less upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung
U||   overhead, as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so
U||   enchantingly beautiful.
U||   The little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy
U||   could not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadth
U||   it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred.
U||   It was most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended
U||   southwardly, but with no very precise regularity. The widest portion
U||   was within eighty yards of the southern extreme. The slopes which
U||   encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their
U||   northern face. Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of
U||   some ninety feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point
U||   was not more than fifty feet wide; but as the visitor proceeded
U||   southwardly from the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his left,
U||   declivities at once less high, less precipitous, and less rocky. All,
U||   in a word, sloped and softened to the south; and yet the whole vale was
U||   engirdled by eminences, more or less high, except at two points. One of
U||   these I have already spoken of. It lay considerably to the north of
U||   west, and was where the setting sun made its way, as I have before
U||   described, into the amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft
U||   in the granite embankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide
U||   at its widest point, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to
U||   lead up, up like a natural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored
U||   mountains and forests. The other opening was directly at the southern
U||   end of the vale. Here, generally, the slopes were nothing more than
U||   gentle inclinations, extending from east to west about one hundred and
U||   fifty yards. In the middle of this extent was a depression, level with
U||   the ordinary floor of the valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in
U||   respect to every thing else, the scene softened and sloped to the
U||   south. To the north—on the craggy precipice—a few paces from the
U||   verge—up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous hickories, black
U||   walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed with occasional oak; and the
U||   strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially, spread
U||   far over the edge of the cliff. Proceeding southwardly, the explorer
U||   saw, at first, the same class of trees, but less and less lofty and
U||   Salvatorish in character; then he saw the gentler elm, succeeded by the
U||   sassafras and locust—these again by the softer linden, red-bud,
U||   catalpa, and maple—these yet again by still more graceful and more
U||   modest varieties. The whole face of the southern declivity was covered
U||   with wild shrubbery alone—an occasional silver willow or white poplar
U||   excepted. In the bottom of the valley itself—(for it must be borne in
U||   mind that the vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or
U||   hillsides)—were to be seen three insulated trees. One was an elm of
U||   fine size and exquisite form: it stood guard over the southern gate of
U||   the vale. Another was a hickory, much larger than the elm, and
U||   altogether a much finer tree, although both were exceedingly beautiful:
U||   it seemed to have taken charge of the northwestern entrance, springing
U||   from a group of rocks in the very jaws of the ravine, and throwing its
U||   graceful body, at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees, far out into
U||   the sunshine of the amphitheatre. About thirty yards east of this tree
U||   stood, however, the pride of the valley, and beyond all question the
U||   most magnificent tree I have ever seen, unless, perhaps, among the
U||   cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a triple-stemmed tulip-tree—the
U||   Liriodendron Tulipiferum—one of the natural order of magnolias. Its
U||   three trunks separated from the parent at about three feet from the
U||   soil, and diverging very slightly and gradually, were not more than
U||   four feet apart at the point where the largest stem shot out into
U||   foliage: this was at an elevation of about eighty feet. The whole
U||   height of the principal division was one hundred and twenty feet.
U||   Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy, vivid green of
U||   the leaves of the tulip-tree. In the present instance they were fully
U||   eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether eclipsed by the
U||   gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive, closely
U||   congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips! Only
U||   thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would convey. And
U||   then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated columnar
U||   stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the ground.
U||   The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other trees scarcely
U||   less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled the valley
U||   with more than Arabian perfumes.
U||   The general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character
U||   as that I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft,
U||   thick, velvety, and miraculously green. It was hard to conceive how all
U||   this beauty had been attained.
U||   I have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the
U||   northwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly
U||   foaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks
U||   out of which sprang the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the
U||   tree, it passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip
U||   tree some twenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in
U||   its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and
U||   western boundaries of the valley. At this point, after a series of
U||   sweeps, it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern
U||   direction meandering as it went—until it became lost in a small lake of
U||   irregular figure (although roughly oval), that lay gleaming near the
U||   lower extremity of the vale. This lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards
U||   in diameter at its widest part. No crystal could be clearer than its
U||   waters. Its bottom, which could be distinctly seen, consisted
U||   altogether, of pebbles brilliantly white. Its banks, of the emerald
U||   grass already described, rounded, rather than sloped, off into the
U||   clear heaven below; and so clear was this heaven, so perfectly, at
U||   times, did it reflect all objects above it, that where the true bank
U||   ended and where the mimic one commenced, it was a point of no little
U||   difficulty to determine. The trout, and some other varieties of fish,
U||   with which this pond seemed to be almost inconveniently crowded, had
U||   all the appearance of veritable flying-fish. It was almost impossible
U||   to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air. A light
U||   birch canoe that lay placidly on the water, was reflected in its
U||   minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed by the most exquisitely
U||   polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing with flowers in full
U||   bloom, and affording little more space than just enough for a
U||   picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house—arose from the lake
U||   not far from its northern shore—to which it was connected by means of
U||   an inconceivably light-looking and yet very primitive bridge. It was
U||   formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip wood. This was
U||   forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore and shore with
U||   a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all oscillation. From
U||   the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet,
U||   which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards, finally passed
U||   through the “depression” (already described) in the middle of the
U||   southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred
U||   feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.
U||   The lake was deep—at some points thirty feet—but the rivulet seldom
U||   exceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. Its bottom
U||   and banks were as those of the pond—if a defect could have been
U||   attributed, in point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive
U||   neatness.
U||   The expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an
U||   occasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball,
U||   or the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums
U||   blossoming gorgeously in great varieties. These latter grew in pots
U||   which were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the
U||   appearance of being indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn’s velvet was
U||   exquisitely spotted with sheep—a considerable flock of which roamed
U||   about the vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of
U||   brilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant
U||   attendance upon these animals, each and all.
U||   Along the eastern and western cliffs—where, toward the upper portion of
U||   the amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous—grew ivy
U||   in great profusion—so that only here and there could even a glimpse of
U||   the naked rock be obtained. The northern precipice, in like manner, was
U||   almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some
U||   springing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from
U||   ledges on its face.
U||   The slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little
U||   domain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to
U||   prevent the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence kind was
U||   observable elsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure
U||   needed:—any stray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its
U||   way out of the vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress
U||   arrested, after a few yards’ advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock
U||   over which tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as I
U||   first drew near the domain. In short, the only ingress or egress was
U||   through a gate occupying a rocky pass in the road, a few paces below
U||   the point at which I stopped to reconnoitre the scene.
U||   I have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the
U||   whole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have said, were
U||   first from west to east, and then from north to south. At the turn, the
U||   stream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form
U||   a peninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about
U||   the sixteenth of an acre. On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house—and
U||   when I say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek,
U||   “etait d’une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,” I
U||   mean, merely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense
U||   of combined novelty and propriety—in a word, of poetry—(for, than in
U||   the words just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the
U||   abstract, a more rigorous definition)—and I do not mean that merely
U||   outre was perceptible in any respect.
U||   In fact nothing could well be more simple—more utterly unpretending
U||   than this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic
U||   arrangement as a picture. I could have fancied, while I looked at it,
U||   that some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.
U||   The point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not
U||   altogether, although it was nearly, the best point from which to survey
U||   the house. I will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it—from a
U||   position on the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.
U||   The main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen
U||   broad—certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to the apex
U||   of the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To the west end of
U||   this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its
U||   proportions:—the line of its front standing back about two yards from
U||   that of the larger house, and the line of its roof, of course, being
U||   considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining. At right
U||   angles to these buildings, and from the rear of the main one—not
U||   exactly in the middle—extended a third compartment, very small—being,
U||   in general, one-third less than the western wing. The roofs of the two
U||   larger were very steep—sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long
U||   concave curve, and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in
U||   front, so as to form the roofs of two piazzas. These latter roofs, of
U||   course, needed no support; but as they had the air of needing it,
U||   slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone.
U||   The roof of the northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of
U||   the main roof. Between the chief building and western wing arose a very
U||   tall and rather slender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks,
U||   alternately black and red:—a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the
U||   top. Over the gables the roofs also projected very much:—in the main
U||   building about four feet to the east and two to the west. The principal
U||   door was not exactly in the main division, being a little to the
U||   east—while the two windows were to the west. These latter did not
U||   extend to the floor, but were much longer and narrower than usual—they
U||   had single shutters like doors—the panes were of lozenge form, but
U||   quite large. The door itself had its upper half of glass, also in
U||   lozenge panes—a movable shutter secured it at night. The door to the
U||   west wing was in its gable, and quite simple—a single window looked out
U||   to the south. There was no external door to the north wing, and it also
U||   had only one window to the east.
U||   The blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with a
U||   balustrade) running diagonally across it—the ascent being from the
U||   south. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave
U||   access to a door leading to the garret, or rather loft—for it was
U||   lighted only by a single window to the north, and seemed to have been
U||   intended as a store-room.
U||   The piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as is
U||   usual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabs
U||   of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortable
U||   footing in all weather. Excellent paths of the same material—not nicely
U||   adapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between
U||   the stones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring
U||   about five paces off, to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay
U||   to the north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few
U||   locusts and catalpas.
U||   Not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the
U||   dead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot in
U||   the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to
U||   determine what manner of sweet thing it could be. From various arms of
U||   this tree hung cages of different kinds. In one, a large wicker
U||   cylinder with a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an
U||   oriole; in a third the impudent bobolink—while three or four more
U||   delicate prisons were loudly vocal with canaries.
U||   The pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet
U||   honeysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure and its
U||   west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance.
U||   Scorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof—then
U||   to the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to
U||   writhe on, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length
U||   it fairly attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs.
U||   The whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashioned
U||   Dutch shingles—broad, and with unrounded corners. It is a peculiarity
U||   of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being
U||   wider at bottom than at top—after the manner of Egyptian architecture;
U||   and in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque effect was
U||   aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the
U||   base of the buildings.
U||   The shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which
U||   this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves
U||   that partially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by an
U||   artist.
U||   From the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildings were
U||   seen at great advantage—for the southeastern angle was thrown
U||   forward—so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts,
U||   with the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just
U||   a sufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roof
U||   to the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the
U||   brook in the near vicinity of the main buildings.
U||   I did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long
U||   enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was clear
U||   that I had wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus good
U||   traveller’s excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, at
U||   all events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.
U||   The road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge,
U||   sloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs. It
U||   led me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over the
U||   bridge, round by the eastern gable to the front door. In this progress,
U||   I took notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained.
U||   As I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in
U||   stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. I held
U||   him out my hand, however, in token of amity—and I never yet knew the
U||   dog who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. He not only
U||   shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me his
U||   paw—afterward extending his civilities to Ponto.
U||   As no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the door,
U||   which stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the
U||   threshold—that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of
U||   age—slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium height. As
U||   she approached, with a certain modest decision of step altogether
U||   indescribable. I said to myself, “Surely here I have found the
U||   perfection of natural, in contradistinction from artificial grace.” The
U||   second impression which she made on me, but by far the more vivid of
U||   the two, was that of enthusiasm. So intense an expression of romance,
U||   perhaps I should call it, or of unworldliness, as that which gleamed
U||   from her deep-set eyes, had never so sunk into my heart of hearts
U||   before. I know not how it is, but this peculiar expression of the eye,
U||   wreathing itself occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful, if
U||   not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.
U||   “Romance,” provided my readers fully comprehended what I would here
U||   imply by the word—“romance” and “womanliness” seem to me convertible
U||   terms: and, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is simply her
U||   womanhood. The eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the interior call
U||   her “Annie, darling!”) were “spiritual grey;” her hair, a light
U||   chestnut: this is all I had time to observe of her.
U||   At her most courteous of invitations, I entered—passing first into a
U||   tolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I took notice
U||   that to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in front
U||   of the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room;
U||   while, opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment,
U||   just the size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large
U||   bow window looking out to the north.
U||   Passing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor—for this, I
U||   afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in his
U||   manner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangements
U||   of the dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personal
U||   appearance of the tenant.
U||   The north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into the
U||   parlor. West of this door was a single window, looking toward the
U||   brook. At the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door
U||   leading into the west wing—probably a kitchen.
U||   Nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the
U||   parlor. On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture—a
U||   white ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windows
U||   were curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full,
U||   and hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits
U||   to the floor—just to the floor. The walls were prepared with a French
U||   paper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord
U||   running zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three of
U||   Julien’s exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall
U||   without frames. One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury,
U||   or rather voluptuousness; another was a “carnival piece,” spirited
U||   beyond compare; the third was a Greek female head—a face so divinely
U||   beautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never
U||   before arrested my attention.
U||   The more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs
U||   (including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather “settee;” its
U||   material was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped
U||   with green; the seat of cane. The chairs and table were “to match,” but
U||   the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which
U||   planned “the grounds;” it is impossible to conceive anything more
U||   graceful.
U||   On the table were a few books; a large, square, crystal bottle of some
U||   novel perfume; a plain ground glass astral (not solar) lamp with an
U||   Italian shade; and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers.
U||   Flowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole
U||   mere decoration of the apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with
U||   a vase of brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of
U||   the room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely
U||   contents. One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late
U||   violets clustered about the open windows.
U||   It is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, a
U||   picture of Mr. Landor’s residence—as I found it. How he made it what it
U||   was—and why—with some particulars of Mr. Landor himself—may, possibly
U||   form the subject of another article.
U||WILLIAM WILSON
U||   What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,
U||   That spectre in my path?
U||                       —Chamberlayne’s Pharronida.
U||   Let me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now
U||   lying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has
U||   been already too much an object for the scorn—for the horror—for the
U||   detestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not
U||   the indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all
U||   outcasts most abandoned!—to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its
U||   honors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?—and a cloud, dense,
U||   dismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and
U||   heaven?
U||   I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later
U||   years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch—these
U||   later years—took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose
U||   origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base
U||   by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a
U||   mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride
U||   of a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What
U||   chance—what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me
U||   while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has
U||   thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through
U||   the dim valley, for the sympathy—I had nearly said for the pity—of my
U||   fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some
U||   measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish
U||   them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little
U||   oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would have them
U||   allow—what they cannot refrain from allowing—that, although temptation
U||   may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least,
U||   tempted before—certainly, never thus fell. And is it therefore that he
U||   has never thus suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And
U||   am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the
U||   wildest of all sublunary visions?
U||   I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable
U||   temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my
U||   earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family
U||   character. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed;
U||   becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my
U||   friends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted
U||   to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.
U||   Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own,
U||   my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which
U||   distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in
U||   complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on
U||   mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when
U||   few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the
U||   guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my
U||   own actions.
U||   My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large,
U||   rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England,
U||   where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all
U||   the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and
U||   spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in
U||   fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues,
U||   inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with
U||   undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell,
U||   breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of
U||   the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded
U||   and asleep.
U||   It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner
U||   experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its
U||   concerns. Steeped in misery as I am—misery, alas! only too real—I shall
U||   be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the
U||   weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial,
U||   and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious
U||   importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I
U||   recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards
U||   so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.
U||   The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were
U||   extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar
U||   and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart
U||   formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week—once
U||   every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were
U||   permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the
U||   neighbouring fields—and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in
U||   the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one
U||   church of the village. Of this church the principal of our school was
U||   pastor. With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to
U||   regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and
U||   slow, he ascended the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so
U||   demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with
U||   wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast,—-could this be he who,
U||   of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered,
U||   ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic
U||   paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!
U||   At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was
U||   riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron
U||   spikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never
U||   opened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already
U||   mentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a
U||   plenitude of mystery—a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more
U||   solemn meditation.
U||   The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious
U||   recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the
U||   play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well
U||   remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it.
U||   Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small
U||   parterre, planted with box and other shrubs, but through this sacred
U||   division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed—such as a first
U||   advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent
U||   or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the
U||   Christmas or Midsummer holidays.
U||   But the house!—how quaint an old building was this!—to me how veritably
U||   a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its windings—to its
U||   incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at any given time, to
U||   say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be.
U||   From each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four
U||   steps either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral branches were
U||   innumerable—inconceivable—and so returning in upon themselves, that our
U||   most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far
U||   different from those with which we pondered upon infinity. During the
U||   five years of my residence here, I was never able to ascertain with
U||   precision, in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment
U||   assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.
U||   The school-room was the largest in the house—I could not help thinking,
U||   in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed
U||   Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring
U||   angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the
U||   sanctum, “during hours,” of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It
U||   was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the
U||   absence of the “Dominie,” we would all have willingly perished by the
U||   peine forte et dure. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far
U||   less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these
U||   was the pulpit of the “classical” usher, one of the “English and
U||   mathematical.” Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing in
U||   endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black,
U||   ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books,
U||   and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque
U||   figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely
U||   lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days
U||   long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the
U||   room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.
U||   Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet
U||   not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life.
U||   The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident
U||   to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school
U||   was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has
U||   derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe
U||   that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon—even
U||   much of the outré. Upon mankind at large the events of very early
U||   existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is
U||   gray shadow—a weak and irregular remembrance—an indistinct regathering
U||   of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so.
U||   In childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find
U||   stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the
U||   exergues of the Carthaginian medals.
U||   Yet in fact—in the fact of the world’s view—how little was there to
U||   remember! The morning’s awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the
U||   connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and
U||   perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its
U||   intrigues;—these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to
U||   involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an
U||   universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and
U||   spirit-stirring. “Oh, le bon temps, que ce siècle de fer!”
U||   In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my
U||   disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates,
U||   and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all not
U||   greatly older than myself;—over all with a single exception. This
U||   exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although no
U||   relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself;—a
U||   circumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble
U||   descent, mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem, by
U||   prescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property
U||   of the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as
U||   William Wilson,—a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My
U||   namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted “our
U||   set,” presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class—in the
U||   sports and broils of the play-ground—to refuse implicit belief in my
U||   assertions, and submission to my will—indeed, to interfere with my
U||   arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth a
U||   supreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master-mind
U||   in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.
U||   Wilson’s rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment;
U||   the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a
U||   point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I
U||   feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which he
U||   maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority;
U||   since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this
U||   superiority—even this equality—was in truth acknowledged by no one but
U||   myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not
U||   even to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and
U||   especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes,
U||   were not more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike
U||   of the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which
U||   enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed
U||   actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify
U||   myself; although there were times when I could not help observing, with
U||   a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with
U||   his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain most
U||   inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner.
U||   I could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate
U||   self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.
U||   Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson’s conduct, conjoined with
U||   our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the
U||   school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were
U||   brothers, among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually
U||   inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have
U||   before said, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most
U||   remote degree, connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been
U||   brothers we must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby’s, I
U||   casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of
U||   January, 1813—and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the
U||   day is precisely that of my own nativity.
U||   It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned
U||   me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of
U||   contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had,
U||   to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly
U||   the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that
U||   it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a
U||   veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called
U||   “speaking terms,” while there were many points of strong congeniality
U||   in our tempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position
U||   alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is
U||   difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings
U||   towards him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture;—some
U||   petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more
U||   respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist
U||   it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were
U||   the most inseparable of companions.
U||   It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us,
U||   which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open
U||   or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain
U||   while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious
U||   and determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by no
U||   means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily
U||   concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that
U||   unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of
U||   its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely
U||   refuses to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable
U||   point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps,
U||   from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist
U||   less at his wit’s end than myself;—my rival had a weakness in the
U||   faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice
U||   at any time above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fail to
U||   take what poor advantage lay in my power.
U||   Wilson’s retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his
U||   practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity first
U||   discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I
U||   never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the
U||   annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and
U||   its very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in my
U||   ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson
U||   came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name,
U||   and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who
U||   would be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly
U||   in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the
U||   school business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable
U||   coincidence, be often confounded with my own.
U||   The feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every
U||   circumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my
U||   rival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we
U||   were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I
U||   perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of
U||   person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching
U||   a relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word,
U||   nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously
U||   concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind,
U||   person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no
U||   reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of
U||   relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had
U||   ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by our
U||   schoolfellows. That he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly
U||   as I, was apparent; but that he could discover in such circumstances so
U||   fruitful a field of annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said
U||   before, to his more than ordinary penetration.
U||   His cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words
U||   and in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress it
U||   was an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without
U||   difficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even
U||   my voice did not escape him. My louder tones were, of course,
U||   unattempted, but then the key—it was identical; and his singular
U||   whisper, it grew the very echo of my own.
U||   How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could
U||   not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe.
U||   I had but one consolation—in the fact that the imitation, apparently,
U||   was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing
U||   and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with
U||   having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle
U||   in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically
U||   disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty
U||   endeavours might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did
U||   not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in
U||   his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve.
U||   Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily
U||   perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the master air of
U||   the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is all
U||   the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for my
U||   individual contemplation and chagrin.
U||   I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage
U||   which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference
U||   with my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of
U||   advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received
U||   it with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at
U||   this distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that
U||   I can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the
U||   side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and
U||   seeming inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his
U||   general talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and
U||   that I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I
U||   less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning
U||   whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly
U||   despised.
U||   As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his
U||   distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I
U||   considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first
U||   years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him
U||   might have been easily ripened into friendship; but, in the latter
U||   months of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his
U||   ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my
U||   sentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of positive
U||   hatred. Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided,
U||   or made a show of avoiding me.
U||   It was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an
U||   altercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually
U||   thrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor
U||   rather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered, in
U||   his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first
U||   startled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim
U||   visions of my earliest infancy—wild, confused and thronging memories of
U||   a time when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the
U||   sensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with
U||   difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the
U||   being who stood before me, at some epoch very long ago—some point of
U||   the past even infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly
U||   as it came; and I mention it at all but to define the day of the last
U||   conversation I there held with my singular namesake.
U||   The huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large
U||   chambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number
U||   of the students. There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a
U||   building so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the odds
U||   and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr.
U||   Bransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest
U||   closets, they were capable of accommodating but a single individual.
U||   One of these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.
U||   One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and
U||   immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one
U||   wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a
U||   wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival.
U||   I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical
U||   wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly
U||   unsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation,
U||   and I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with
U||   which I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered,
U||   leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a
U||   step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of
U||   his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again
U||   approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the
U||   prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright
U||   rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment,
U||   upon his countenance. I looked;—and a numbness, an iciness of feeling
U||   instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my
U||   whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable
U||   horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer
U||   proximity to the face. Were these—these the lineaments of William
U||   Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if with a fit
U||   of the ague in fancying they were not. What was there about them to
U||   confound me in this manner? I gazed;—while my brain reeled with a
U||   multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared—assuredly not
U||   thus—in the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same
U||   contour of person! the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his
U||   dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and
U||   my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility,
U||   that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of
U||   this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I
U||   extinguished the lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at
U||   once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again.
U||   After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found
U||   myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to
U||   enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby’s, or at least to
U||   effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I
U||   remembered them. The truth—the tragedy—of the drama was no more. I
U||   could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom
U||   called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human
U||   credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I
U||   hereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely
U||   to be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex
U||   of thoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so
U||   recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours,
U||   engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory
U||   only the veriest levities of a former existence.
U||   I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy
U||   here—a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the
U||   vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without
U||   profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a
U||   somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of
U||   soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute
U||   students to a secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of
U||   the night; for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until
U||   morning. The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and
U||   perhaps more dangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already
U||   faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at
U||   its height. Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act
U||   of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my
U||   attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial
U||   unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice of a
U||   servant from without. He said that some person, apparently in great
U||   haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.
U||   Wildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted
U||   than surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought
U||   me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there
U||   hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the
U||   exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular
U||   window. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the
U||   figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white
U||   kerseymere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself
U||   wore at the moment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but
U||   the features of his face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering he
U||   strode hurriedly up to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of
U||   petulant impatience, whispered the words “William Wilson!” in my ear.
U||   I grew perfectly sober in an instant.
U||   There was that in the manner of the stranger, and in the tremulous
U||   shake of his uplifted finger, as he held it between my eyes and the
U||   light, which filled me with unqualified amazement; but it was not this
U||   which had so violently moved me. It was the pregnancy of solemn
U||   admonition in the singular, low, hissing utterance; and, above all, it
U||   was the character, the tone, the key, of those few, simple, and
U||   familiar, yet whispered syllables, which came with a thousand thronging
U||   memories of bygone days, and struck upon my soul with the shock of a
U||   galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use of my senses he was gone.
U||   Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered
U||   imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I
U||   busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid
U||   speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the
U||   identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered
U||   with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But who
U||   and what was this Wilson?—and whence came he?—and what were his
U||   purposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely
U||   ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family
U||   had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby’s academy on the afternoon of
U||   the day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased to
U||   think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in a
U||   contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went; the
U||   uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and
U||   annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in the
U||   luxury already so dear to my heart,—to vie in profuseness of
U||   expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in
U||   Great Britain.
U||   Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke
U||   forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of
U||   decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to
U||   pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among
U||   spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude
U||   of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of
U||   vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.
U||   It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly
U||   fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the
U||   vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept
U||   in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of
U||   increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded
U||   among my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the
U||   very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable
U||   sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the
U||   impunity with which it was committed. Who, indeed, among my most
U||   abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest
U||   evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses, the gay,
U||   the frank, the generous William Wilson—the noblest and most liberal
U||   commoner at Oxford—him whose follies (said his parasites) were but the
U||   follies of youth and unbridled fancy—whose errors but inimitable
U||   whim—whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance?
U||   I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there
U||   came to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning—rich, said
U||   report, as Herodes Atticus—his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soon
U||   found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting
U||   subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived,
U||   with the gambler’s usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the
U||   more effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes
U||   being ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should
U||   be final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr.
U||   Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him justice,
U||   entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a
U||   better coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some
U||   eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of
U||   cards should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my
U||   contemplated dupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the
U||   low finesse was omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is
U||   a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall
U||   its victim.
U||   We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length
U||   effected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist.
U||   The game, too, was my favorite écarté! The rest of the company,
U||   interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards,
U||   and were standing around us as spectators. The parvenu, who had been
U||   induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink
U||   deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of
U||   manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but
U||   could not altogether account. In a very short period he had become my
U||   debtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he
U||   did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating—he proposed to double
U||   our already extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance,
U||   and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry
U||   words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally
U||   comply. The result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was
U||   in my toils: in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some
U||   time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the
U||   wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a
U||   pallor truly fearful. I say to my astonishment. Glendinning had been
U||   represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums
U||   which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I
U||   supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That
U||   he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most
U||   readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation
U||   of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less
U||   interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a
U||   discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from
U||   among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the
U||   part of Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his
U||   total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the
U||   pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices even of a
U||   fiend.
U||   What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The
U||   pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom
U||   over all; and, for some moments, a profound silence was maintained,
U||   during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many
U||   burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned
U||   of the party. I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was
U||   for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and
U||   extraordinary interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors
U||   of the apartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent,
U||   with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by
U||   magic, every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just
U||   to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and
U||   closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and
U||   we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of
U||   us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness
U||   had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.
U||   “Gentlemen,” he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten
U||   whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, “Gentlemen, I
U||   make no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am but
U||   fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true
U||   character of the person who has to-night won at écarté a large sum of
U||   money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an
U||   expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary
U||   information. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of
U||   the cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may
U||   be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning
U||   wrapper.”
U||   While he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard
U||   a pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and as
U||   abruptly as he had entered. Can I—shall I describe my sensations? Must
U||   I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had
U||   little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the
U||   spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the
U||   lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in écarté,
U||   and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of
U||   those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of
U||   the species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly
U||   convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In
U||   this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the
U||   pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while
U||   the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing
U||   for his victim which may count in the records of the game.
U||   Any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me
U||   less than the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which
U||   it was received.
U||   “Mr. Wilson,” said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet
U||   an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, “Mr. Wilson, this is your
U||   property.” (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had
U||   thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching
U||   the scene of play.) “I presume it is supererogatory to seek here
U||   (eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther
U||   evidence of your skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will see the
U||   necessity, I hope, of quitting Oxford—at all events, of quitting
U||   instantly my chambers.”
U||   Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should
U||   have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had
U||   not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the
U||   most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare
U||   description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not
U||   venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention;
U||   for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of
U||   this frivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that
U||   which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of
U||   the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon
U||   terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had
U||   no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but
U||   its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest possible
U||   particular. The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had
U||   been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all
U||   by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself.
U||   Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston;
U||   placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute
U||   scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a
U||   hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of
U||   horror and of shame.
U||   I fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and
U||   proved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet
U||   only begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence
U||   of the detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years
U||   flew, while I experienced no relief. Villain!—at Rome, with how
U||   untimely, yet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between
U||   me and my ambition! At Vienna, too—at Berlin—and at Moscow! Where, in
U||   truth, had I not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his
U||   inscrutable tyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a
U||   pestilence; and to the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.
U||   And again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would I
U||   demand the questions “Who is he?—whence came he?—and what are his
U||   objects?” But no answer was there found. And then I scrutinized, with a
U||   minute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of
U||   his impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon
U||   which to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one
U||   of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path,
U||   had he so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb
U||   those actions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in
U||   bitter mischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so
U||   imperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency
U||   so pertinaciously, so insultingly denied!
U||   I had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long
U||   period of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity
U||   maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so
U||   contrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will,
U||   that I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson what
U||   he might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of
U||   folly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher
U||   at Eton—in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford,—in him who thwarted my
U||   ambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or
U||   what he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,—that in this, my arch-enemy
U||   and evil genius, could fail to recognise the William Wilson of my
U||   school boy days,—the namesake, the companion, the rival,—the hated and
U||   dreaded rival at Dr. Bransby’s? Impossible!—But let me hasten to the
U||   last eventful scene of the drama.
U||   Thus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. The
U||   sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated
U||   character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and
U||   omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which
U||   certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had
U||   operated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness
U||   and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly
U||   reluctant submission to his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had
U||   given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my
U||   hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I
U||   began to murmur,—to hesitate,—to resist. And was it only fancy which
U||   induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that
U||   of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this as it may,
U||   I now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length
U||   nurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I
U||   would submit no longer to be enslaved.
U||   It was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18—, that I attended a
U||   masquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had
U||   indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and
U||   now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond
U||   endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of
U||   the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for
U||   I was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the
U||   young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio.
U||   With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to
U||   me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now,
U||   having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way
U||   into her presence. At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my
U||   shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my
U||   ear.
U||   In an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus
U||   interrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired,
U||   as I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a
U||   Spanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson
U||   belt sustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his
U||   face.
U||   “Scoundrel!” I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I
U||   uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, “scoundrel! impostor! accursed
U||   villain! you shall not—you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me, or I
U||   stab you where you stand!”—and I broke my way from the ball-room into a
U||   small ante-chamber adjoining, dragging him unresistingly with me as I
U||   went.
U||   Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the
U||   wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw.
U||   He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in
U||   silence, and put himself upon his defence.
U||   The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild
U||   excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a
U||   multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the
U||   wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with
U||   brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.
U||   At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to
U||   prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying
U||   antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray that
U||   astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then
U||   presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been
U||   sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the
U||   arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. A large
U||   mirror,—so at first it seemed to me in my confusion—now stood where
U||   none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in
U||   extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and
U||   dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait.
U||   Thus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist—it was
U||   Wilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution. His
U||   mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not a
U||   thread in all his raiment—not a line in all the marked and singular
U||   lineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute
U||   identity, mine own!
U||   It was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have
U||   fancied that I myself was speaking while he said:
U||   “You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also
U||   dead—dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou
U||   exist—and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how
U||   utterly thou hast murdered thyself.”
U||THE TELL-TALE HEART.
U||   True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why
U||   will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses—not
U||   destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I
U||   heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in
U||   hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily—how
U||   calmly I can tell you the whole story.
U||   It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once
U||   conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion
U||   there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had
U||   never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his
U||   eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye,
U||   with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and
U||   so by degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the
U||   old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
U||   Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you
U||   should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with
U||   what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to
U||   work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week
U||   before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the
U||   latch of his door and opened it—oh, so gently! And then, when I had
U||   made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all
U||   closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head.
U||   Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved
U||   it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s
U||   sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so
U||   far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!—would a madman
U||   have been so wise as this? And then, when my head was well in the room,
U||   I undid the lantern cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the
U||   hinges creaked)—I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell
U||   upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights—every night
U||   just at midnight—but I found the eye always closed; and so it was
U||   impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but
U||   his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into
U||   the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a
U||   hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he
U||   would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every
U||   night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.
U||   Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the
U||   door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never
U||   before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers—of my
U||   sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think
U||   that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even
U||   to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea;
U||   and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if
U||   startled. Now you may think that I drew back—but no. His room was as
U||   black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close
U||   fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see
U||   the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.
U||   I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb
U||   slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed,
U||   crying out—“Who’s there?”
U||   I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a
U||   muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still
U||   sitting up in the bed listening;—just as I have done, night after
U||   night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
U||   Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal
U||   terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no!—it was the low
U||   stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged
U||   with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when
U||   all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening,
U||   with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it
U||   well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled
U||   at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first
U||   slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever
U||   since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but
U||   could not. He had been saying to himself—“It is nothing but the wind in
U||   the chimney—it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “It is merely a
U||   cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been trying to
U||   comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.
U||   All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his
U||   black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the
U||   mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to
U||   feel—although he neither saw nor heard—to feel the presence of my head
U||   within the room.
U||   When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie
U||   down, I resolved to open a little—a very, very little crevice in the
U||   lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily,
U||   stealthily—until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the
U||   spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.
U||   It was open—wide, wide open—and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I
U||   saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue, with a hideous veil
U||   over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see
U||   nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for I had directed the
U||   ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.
U||   And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but
U||   over-acuteness of the sense?—now, I say, there came to my ears a low,
U||   dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I
U||   knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart.
U||   It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier
U||   into courage.
U||   But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held
U||   the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray
U||   upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It
U||   grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old
U||   man’s terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder
U||   every moment!—do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous:
U||   so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful
U||   silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to
U||   uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and
U||   stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart
U||   must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by
U||   a neighbour! The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw
U||   open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only.
U||   In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over
U||   him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many
U||   minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not
U||   vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased.
U||   The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes,
U||   he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it
U||   there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye
U||   would trouble me no more.
U||   If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe
U||   the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night
U||   waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered
U||   the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.
U||   I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and
U||   deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so
U||   cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have
U||   detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any
U||   kind—no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had
U||   caught all—ha! ha!
U||   When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock—still dark
U||   as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the
U||   street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,—for what had I
U||   now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with
U||   perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by
U||   a neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;
U||   information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the
U||   officers) had been deputed to search the premises.
U||   I smiled,—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The
U||   shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was
U||   absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade
U||   them search—search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I
U||   showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my
U||   confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to
U||   rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my
U||   perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which
U||   reposed the corpse of the victim.
U||   The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was
U||   singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they
U||   chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale
U||   and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my
U||   ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more
U||   distinct:—it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely
U||   to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained
U||   definiteness—until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my
U||   ears.
U||   No doubt I now grew very pale;—but I talked more fluently, and with a
U||   heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could I do? It was a
U||   low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch makes when
U||   enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it
U||   not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but the noise steadily
U||   increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with
U||   violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would
U||   they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as
U||   if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise
U||   steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I swore!
U||   I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the
U||   boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew
U||   louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled.
U||   Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no, no! They heard!—they
U||   suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of my horror!—this I
U||   thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony!
U||   Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those
U||   hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and
U||   now—again!—hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!
U||   “Villains!” I shrieked, “dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear up
U||   the planks!—here, here!—It is the beating of his hideous heart!”
U||BERENICE
U||   Dicebant mihi sodales, si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas
U||   aliquar tulum fore levatas.—Ebn Zaiat.
U||   Misery is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform.
U||   Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various
U||   as the hues of that arch—as distinct too, yet as intimately blended.
U||   Overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from
U||   beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness?—from the covenant of
U||   peace, a simile of sorrow? But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of
U||   good, so, in fact, out of joy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past
U||   bliss is the anguish of to-day, or the agonies which are, have their
U||   origin in the ecstasies which might have been.
U||   My baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not mention. Yet
U||   there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray,
U||   hereditary halls. Our line has been called a race of visionaries; and
U||   in many striking particulars—in the character of the family mansion—in
U||   the frescos of the chief saloon—in the tapestries of the dormitories—in
U||   the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory—but more especially in
U||   the gallery of antique paintings—in the fashion of the library
U||   chamber—and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the library’s
U||   contents—there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the belief.
U||   The recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber,
U||   and with its volumes—of which latter I will say no more. Here died my
U||   mother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness to say that I had
U||   not lived before—that the soul has no previous existence. You deny
U||   it?—let us not argue the matter. Convinced myself, I seek not to
U||   convince. There is, however, a remembrance of aerial forms—of spiritual
U||   and meaning eyes—of sounds, musical yet sad—a remembrance which will
U||   not be excluded; a memory like a shadow—vague, variable, indefinite,
U||   unsteady; and like a shadow, too, in the impossibility of my getting
U||   rid of it while the sunlight of my reason shall exist.
U||   In that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of what
U||   seemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions of fairy
U||   land—into a palace of imagination—into the wild dominions of monastic
U||   thought and erudition—it is not singular that I gazed around me with a
U||   startled and ardent eye—that I loitered away my boyhood in books, and
U||   dissipated my youth in reverie; but it is singular that as years rolled
U||   away, and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my
U||   fathers—it is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of
U||   my life—wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character of
U||   my commonest thought. The realities of the world affected me as
U||   visions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land of
U||   dreams became, in turn, not the material of my every-day existence, but
U||   in very deed that existence utterly and solely in itself.
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   Berenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternal
U||   halls. Yet differently we grew—I, ill of health, and buried in
U||   gloom—she, agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers, the
U||   ramble on the hill-side—mine the studies of the cloister; I, living
U||   within my own heart, and addicted, body and soul, to the most intense
U||   and painful meditation—she, roaming carelessly through life, with no
U||   thought of the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the
U||   raven-winged hours. Berenice!—I call upon her name—Berenice!—and from
U||   the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are
U||   startled at the sound! Ah, vividly is her image before me now, as in
U||   the early days of her light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet
U||   fantastic beauty! Oh, sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad
U||   among its fountains! And then—then all is mystery and terror, and a
U||   tale which should not be told. Disease—a fatal disease, fell like the
U||   simoon upon her frame; and, even while I gazed upon her, the spirit of
U||   change swept over her, pervading her mind, her habits, and her
U||   character, and, in a manner the most subtle and terrible, disturbing
U||   even the identity of her person! Alas! the destroyer came and went!—and
U||   the victim—where is she? I knew her not—or knew her no longer as
U||   Berenice.
U||   Among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and
U||   primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the
U||   moral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the most
U||   distressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy not
U||   unfrequently terminating in trance itself—trance very nearly resembling
U||   positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recovery was in most
U||   instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean time my own disease—for I
U||   have been told that I should call it by no other appellation—my own
U||   disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumed finally a monomaniac
U||   character of a novel and extraordinary form—hourly and momently gaining
U||   vigor—and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible
U||   ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it, consisted in a morbid
U||   irritability of those properties of the mind in metaphysical science
U||   termed the attentive. It is more than probable that I am not
U||   understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner possible to
U||   convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate idea of
U||   that nervous intensity of interest with which, in my case, the powers
U||   of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried themselves,
U||   in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe.
U||   To muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to some
U||   frivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a book; to
U||   become absorbed, for the better part of a summer’s day, in a quaint
U||   shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor; to lose
U||   myself, for an entire night, in watching the steady flame of a lamp, or
U||   the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a
U||   flower; to repeat, monotonously, some common word, until the sound, by
U||   dint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the
U||   mind; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of
U||   absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in: such
U||   were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by
U||   a condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether
U||   unparalleled, but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis
U||   or explanation.
U||   Yet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid
U||   attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, must
U||   not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common
U||   to all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent
U||   imagination. It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme
U||   condition, or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and
U||   essentially distinct and different. In the one instance, the dreamer,
U||   or enthusiast, being interested by an object usually not frivolous,
U||   imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions
U||   and suggestions issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a
U||   day-dream often replete with luxury, he finds the incitamentum, or
U||   first cause of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my
U||   case, the primary object was invariably frivolous, although assuming,
U||   through the medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal
U||   importance. Few deductions, if any, were made; and those few
U||   pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre. The
U||   meditations were never pleasurable; and, at the termination of the
U||   reverie, the first cause, so far from being out of sight, had attained
U||   that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing
U||   feature of the disease. In a word, the powers of mind more particularly
U||   exercised were, with me, as I have said before, the attentive, and are,
U||   with the day-dreamer, the speculative.
U||   My books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate the
U||   disorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginative
U||   and inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of the
U||   disorder itself. I well remember, among others, the treatise of the
U||   noble Italian, Coelius Secundus Curio, “De Amplitudine Beati Regni
U||   Dei;” St. Austin’s great work, the “City of God;” and Tertullian’s “De
U||   Carne Christi,” in which the paradoxical sentence “Mortuus est Dei
U||   filius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum
U||   est quia impossibile est,” occupied my undivided time, for many weeks
U||   of laborious and fruitless investigation.
U||   Thus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial
U||   things, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by
U||   Ptolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of human
U||   violence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembled
U||   only to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And although, to a
U||   careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond doubt, that the
U||   alteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the moral condition of
U||   Berenice, would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense
U||   and abnormal meditation whose nature I have been at some trouble in
U||   explaining, yet such was not in any degree the case. In the lucid
U||   intervals of my infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and,
U||   taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I
U||   did not fail to ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the
U||   wonder-working means by which so strange a revolution had been so
U||   suddenly brought to pass. But these reflections partook not of the
U||   idiosyncrasy of my disease, and were such as would have occurred, under
U||   similar circumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own
U||   character, my disorder revelled in the less important but more
U||   startling changes wrought in the physical frame of Berenice—in the
U||   singular and most appalling distortion of her personal identity.
U||   During the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I had
U||   never loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with
U||   me, had never been of the heart, and my passions always were of the
U||   mind. Through the gray of the early morning—among the trellised shadows
U||   of the forest at noonday—and in the silence of my library at night—she
U||   had flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her—not as the living and
U||   breathing Berenice, but as the Berenice of a dream; not as a being of
U||   the earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being; not as a
U||   thing to admire, but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as the
U||   theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation. And now—now
U||   I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach; yet,
U||   bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to mind
U||   that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her of
U||   marriage.
U||   And at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, upon an
U||   afternoon in the winter of the year—one of those unseasonably warm,
U||   calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon
U||   (*1),—I sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment of
U||   the library. But, uplifting my eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before
U||   me.
U||   Was it my own excited imagination—or the misty influence of the
U||   atmosphere—or the uncertain twilight of the chamber—or the gray
U||   draperies which fell around her figure—that caused in it so vacillating
U||   and indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke no word; and
U||   I—not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy chill ran
U||   through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a
U||   consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair,
U||   I remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes
U||   riveted upon her person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not
U||   one vestige of the former being lurked in any single line of the
U||   contour. My burning glances at length fell upon the face.
U||   The forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and the
U||   once jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollow
U||   temples with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow, and jarring
U||   discordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning
U||   melancholy of the countenance. The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless,
U||   and seemingly pupilless, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy
U||   stare to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips. They parted;
U||   and in a smile of peculiar meaning, the teeth of the changed Berenice
U||   disclosed themselves slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never
U||   beheld them, or that, having done so, I had died!
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   The shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that my
U||   cousin had departed from the chamber. But from the disordered chamber
U||   of my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would not be driven away, the
U||   white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth. Not a speck on their
U||   surface—not a shade on their enamel—not an indenture in their edges—but
U||   what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory.
U||   I saw them now even more unequivocally than I beheld them then. The
U||   teeth!—the teeth!—they were here, and there, and everywhere, and
U||   visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and excessively white,
U||   with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the very moment of their
U||   first terrible development. Then came the full fury of my monomania,
U||   and I struggled in vain against its strange and irresistible influence.
U||   In the multiplied objects of the external world I had no thoughts but
U||   for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied desire. All other
U||   matters and all different interests became absorbed in their single
U||   contemplation. They—they alone were present to the mental eye, and
U||   they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of my mental
U||   life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every attitude. I
U||   surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their peculiarities. I
U||   pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the alteration in their
U||   nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in imagination a sensitive
U||   and sentient power, and even when unassisted by the lips, a capability
U||   of moral expression. Of Mademoiselle Salle it has been well said, “Que
U||   tous ses pas etaient des sentiments,” and of Berenice I more seriously
U||   believed que toutes ses dents etaient des idées. Des idées!—ah here was
U||   the idiotic thought that destroyed me! Des idées!—ah, therefore it was
U||   that I coveted them so madly! I felt that their possession could alone
U||   ever restore me to peace, in giving me back to reason.
U||   And the evening closed in upon me thus—and then the darkness came, and
U||   tarried, and went—and the day again dawned—and the mists of a second
U||   night were now gathering around—and still I sat motionless in that
U||   solitary room—and still I sat buried in meditation—and still the
U||   phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy, as, with the
U||   most vivid hideous distinctness, it floated about amid the changing
U||   lights and shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon my
U||   dreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,
U||   succeeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many low
U||   moanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my seat, and throwing open
U||   one of the doors of the library, saw standing out in the ante-chamber a
U||   servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that Berenice was—no more!
U||   She had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at the
U||   closing in of the night, the grave was ready for its tenant, and all
U||   the preparations for the burial were completed.
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   I found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone.
U||   It seemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream.
U||   I knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware, that since the
U||   setting of the sun, Berenice had been interred. But of that dreary
U||   period which intervened I had no positive, at least no definite
U||   comprehension. Yet its memory was replete with horror—horror more
U||   horrible from being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. It
U||   was a fearful page in the record my existence, written all over with
U||   dim, and hideous, and unintelligible recollections. I strived to
U||   decypher them, but in vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a
U||   departed sound, the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed
U||   to be ringing in my ears. I had done a deed—what was it? I asked myself
U||   the question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered
U||   me,—“What was it?”
U||   On the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box. It
U||   was of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before,
U||   for it was the property of the family physician; but how came it there,
U||   upon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things were
U||   in no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the
U||   open pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words
U||   were the singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:—“Dicebant mihi
U||   sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore
U||   levatas.” Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head erect
U||   themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed within my
U||   veins?
U||   There came a light tap at the library door—and, pale as the tenant of a
U||   tomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror,
U||   and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low. What said
U||   he?—some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing the
U||   silence of the night—of the gathering together of the household—of a
U||   search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones grew
U||   thrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave—of a
U||   disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing—still palpitating—still
U||   alive!
U||   He pointed to garments;—they were muddy and clotted with gore. I spoke
U||   not, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented with the
U||   impress of human nails. He directed my attention to some object against
U||   the wall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was a spade. With a
U||   shriek I bounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it.
U||   But I could not force it open; and in my tremor, it slipped from my
U||   hands, and fell heavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a
U||   rattling sound, there rolled out some instruments of dental surgery,
U||   intermingled with thirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances
U||   that were scattered to and fro about the floor.
U||ELEONORA
U||   Sub conservatione formæ specificæ salva anima.
U||                       —Raymond Lully.
U||   I am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion. Men
U||   have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether
U||   madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence—whether much that is
U||   glorious—whether all that is profound—does not spring from disease of
U||   thought—from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general
U||   intellect. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which
U||   escape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain
U||   glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they have
U||   been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn
U||   something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere
U||   knowledge which is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless or
U||   compassless into the vast ocean of the “light ineffable,” and again,
U||   like the adventures of the Nubian geographer, “agressi sunt mare
U||   tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.”
U||   We will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are two
U||   distinct conditions of my mental existence—the condition of a lucid
U||   reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events
U||   forming the first epoch of my life—and a condition of shadow and doubt,
U||   appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what
U||   constitutes the second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall
U||   tell of the earlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the
U||   later time, give only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it
U||   altogether, or, if doubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the
U||   Oedipus.
U||   She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly
U||   these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my
U||   mother long departed. Eleonora was the name of my cousin. We had always
U||   dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the
U||   Many-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for
U||   it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around
U||   about it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path
U||   was trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was
U||   need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of
U||   forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of
U||   fragrant flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing
U||   of the world without the valley—I, and my cousin, and her mother.
U||   From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our
U||   encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter
U||   than all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in
U||   mazy courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among
U||   hills still dimmer than those whence it had issued. We called it the
U||   “River of Silence”; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its
U||   flow. No murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along,
U||   that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within
U||   its bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in
U||   its own old station, shining on gloriously forever.
U||   The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided
U||   through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that
U||   extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams
U||   until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom,—these spots, not
U||   less than the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the
U||   mountains that girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass,
U||   thick, short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled
U||   throughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple
U||   violet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to
U||   our hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.
U||   And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of
U||   dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not
U||   upright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at
U||   noon-day into the centre of the valley. Their mark was speckled with
U||   the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than
U||   all save the cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green
U||   of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous
U||   lines, dallying with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant
U||   serpents of Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.
U||   Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with
U||   Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one evening at
U||   the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my
U||   own, that we sat, locked in each other’s embrace, beneath the
U||   serpent-like trees, and looked down within the water of the River of
U||   Silence at our images therein. We spoke no words during the rest of
U||   that sweet day, and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and
U||   few. We had drawn the God Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he
U||   had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers. The
U||   passions which had for centuries distinguished our race, came thronging
U||   with the fancies for which they had been equally noted, and together
U||   breathed a delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A
U||   change fell upon all things. Strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped,
U||   burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before. The
U||   tints of the green carpet deepened; and when, one by one, the white
U||   daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of
U||   the ruby-red asphodel. And life arose in our paths; for the tall
U||   flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his
U||   scarlet plumage before us. The golden and silver fish haunted the
U||   river, out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur
U||   that swelled, at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of
U||   the harp of Æolus—sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora. And now,
U||   too, a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of
U||   Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and
U||   settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower, until
U||   its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning all their
U||   dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if forever, within a
U||   magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.
U||   The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was a
U||   maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the
U||   flowers. No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her
U||   heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked
U||   together in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the
U||   mighty changes which had lately taken place therein.
U||   At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change
U||   which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one
U||   sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the
U||   songs of the bard of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring,
U||   again and again, in every impressive variation of phrase.
U||   She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom—that, like the
U||   ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; but the
U||   terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she
U||   revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of
U||   Silence. She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley
U||   of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses,
U||   transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some
U||   maiden of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw
U||   myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to
U||   herself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to
U||   any daughter of Earth—that I would in no manner prove recreant to her
U||   dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she
U||   had blessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to
U||   witness the pious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of
U||   Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that
U||   promise, involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will
U||   not permit me to make record of it here. And the bright eyes of
U||   Eleonora grew brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly
U||   burthen had been taken from her breast; and she trembled and very
U||   bitterly wept; but she made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she
U||   but a child?) and it made easy to her the bed of her death. And she
U||   said to me, not many days afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of
U||   what I had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me
U||   in that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her return
U||   to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if this thing were,
U||   indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise, that she would, at
U||   least, give me frequent indications of her presence, sighing upon me in
U||   the evening winds, or filling the air which I breathed with perfume
U||   from the censers of the angels. And, with these words upon her lips,
U||   she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the first epoch of
U||   my own.
U||   Thus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in Time’s
U||   path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second
U||   era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I
U||   mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But let me on.—Years dragged
U||   themselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the
U||   Many-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things. The
U||   star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no
U||   more. The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the
U||   ruby-red asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of
U||   them, ten by ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and
U||   were ever encumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for
U||   the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but
U||   flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds
U||   that had arrived in his company. And the golden and silver fish swam
U||   down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the
U||   sweet river never again. And the lulling melody that had been softer
U||   than the wind-harp of Æolus, and more divine than all save the voice of
U||   Eleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and
U||   lower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the
U||   solemnity of its original silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous
U||   cloud uprose, and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness
U||   of old, fell back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its
U||   manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the
U||   Many-Colored Grass.
U||   Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds
U||   of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy
U||   perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when
U||   my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden
U||   with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and
U||   once—oh, but once only! I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber
U||   of death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.
U||   But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I longed
U||   for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At length the
U||   valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for
U||   ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.
U||   I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have
U||   served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long
U||   in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a
U||   stately court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness
U||   of women, bewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my soul had
U||   proved true to its vows, and the indications of the presence of
U||   Eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly
U||   these manifestations they ceased, and the world grew dark before mine
U||   eyes, and I stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at
U||   the terrible temptations which beset me; for there came from some far,
U||   far distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served,
U||   a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once—at
U||   whose footstool I bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in
U||   the most abject worship of love. What, indeed, was my passion for the
U||   young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the
U||   delirium, and the spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I
U||   poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal
U||   Ermengarde?—Oh, bright was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge
U||   I had room for none other. Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as
U||   I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of
U||   them—and of her.
U||   I wedded—nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness was
U||   not visited upon me. And once—but once again in the silence of the
U||   night; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken
U||   me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:
U||   “Sleep in peace! for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in
U||   taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art
U||   absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of
U||   thy vows unto Eleonora.”
U||NOTES TO THE SECOND VOLUME
U||Notes — Scheherazade
U||   (*1) The coralites.
U||   (*2) “One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is a
U||   petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists of
U||   several hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone. Some
U||   trees, now growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling fact for
U||   natural philosophers, and must cause them to modify the existing theory
U||   of petrification.—Kennedy.
U||   This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated by the
U||   discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head waters of the
U||   Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in the Black Hills of
U||   the rocky chain.
U||   There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the globe
U||   more remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point of view
U||   than that presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The traveller,
U||   having passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of the
U||   city, proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the road
U||   across the desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles up
U||   a low barren valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh
U||   as if the tide had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of
U||   sandhills, which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The
U||   scene now presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate.
U||   A mass of fragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when struck
U||   by his horse’s hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to extend itself
U||   for miles and miles around him, in the form of a decayed and prostrate
U||   forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue, but retains its form in
U||   perfection, the pieces being from one to fifteen feet in length, and
U||   from half a foot to three feet in thickness, strewed so closely
U||   together, as far as the eye can reach, that an Egyptian donkey can
U||   scarcely thread its way through amongst them, and so natural that, were
U||   it in Scotland or Ireland, it might pass without remark for some
U||   enormous drained bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the
U||   sun. The roots and rudiments of the branches are, in many cases, nearly
U||   perfect, and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily
U||   recognizable. The most delicate of the sap vessels, and all the finer
U||   portions of the centre of the wood, are perfectly entire, and bear to
U||   be examined with the strongest magnifiers. The whole are so thoroughly
U||   silicified as to scratch glass and are capable of receiving the highest
U||   polish.— Asiatic Magazine.

U||   (*5) “During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind
U||   produced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more than
U||   fifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way by
U||   groping. During the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794, at Caserta, four
U||   leagues distant, people could only walk by the light of torches. On the
U||   first of May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic ashes and sand, coming from a
U||   volcano in the island of St. Vincent, covered the whole of Barbadoes,
U||   spreading over it so intense a darkness that, at mid-day, in the open
U||   air, one could not perceive the trees or other objects near him, or
U||   even a white handkerchief placed at the distance of six inches from the
U||   eye.“—Murray, p. 215, Phil. edit.

U||   of the granite soil sank and left a lake eight hundred yards in

U||   months under the water.”—Murray, p. 221

U||   also a “rock.”
U||   (*10) The Epidendron, Flos Aeris, of the family of the Orchideae, grows

U||   Mr. J. B. Williams, of Salem, Mass., presented the “National Institute”
U||   with an insect from New Zealand, with the following description: “‘The
U||   Hotte, a decided caterpillar, or worm, is found gnawing at the root of
U||   the Rota tree, with a plant growing out of its head. This most peculiar
U||   and extraordinary insect travels up both the Rota and Ferriri trees,
U||   and entering into the top, eats its way, perforating the trunk of the
U||   trees until it reaches the root, and dies, or remains dormant, and the
U||   plant propagates out of its head; the body remains perfect and entire,
U||   of a harder substance than when alive. From this insect the natives
U||   make a coloring for tattooing.
U||   (*13) In mines and natural caves we find a species of cryptogamous
U||   fungus that emits an intense phosphorescence.
U||   (*14) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.
U||   (*15) The corolla of this flower (Aristolochia Clematitis), which is
U||   tubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is inflated into a
U||   globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset with
U||   stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains the pistil,
U||   which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together with the
U||   surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than the germen,
U||   cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the
U||   flower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence,
U||   without some additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily
U||   fan down to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has
U||   furnished in this case, is that of the Tiputa Pennicornis, a small
U||   insect, which entering the tube of the corrolla in quest of honey,
U||   descends to the bottom, and rummages about till it becomes quite
U||   covered with pollen; but not being able to force its way out again,
U||   owing to the downward position of the hairs, which converge to a point
U||   like the wires of a mouse-trap, and being somewhat impatient of its
U||   confinement it brushes backwards and forwards, trying every corner,
U||   till, after repeatedly traversing the stigma, it covers it with pollen
U||   sufficient for its impregnation, in consequence of which the flower
U||   soon begins to droop, and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube,
U||   effecting an easy passage for the escape of the insect.”—Rev. P.
U||   Keith-System of Physiological Botany.
U||   (*16) The bees—ever since bees were—have been constructing their cells
U||   with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such
U||   inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving the
U||   profoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in the very
U||   number, and at the very angles, which will afford the creatures the
U||   most room that is compatible with the greatest stability of structure.
U||   During the latter part of the last century, the question arose among
U||   mathematicians—“to determine the best form that can be given to the
U||   sails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from the
U||   revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of the revolution.” This
U||   is an excessively complex problem, for it is, in other words, to find
U||   the best possible position at an infinity of varied distances and at an
U||   infinity of points on the arm. There were a thousand futile attempts to
U||   answer the query on the part of the most illustrious mathematicians,
U||   and when at length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found
U||   that the wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever
U||   since the first bird had traversed the air.

U||   white surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258 of an inch,
U||   their intensity is doubled. So also if the difference in length be any
U||   whole-number multiple of that fraction. A multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4,
U||   &c., gives an intensity equal to one ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2,
U||   3 1/2, &c., gives the result of total darkness. In violet rays similar
U||   effects arise when the difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; and
U||   with all other rays the results are the same—the difference varying
U||   with a uniform increase from the violet to the red.

U||   (*32) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a red

U||   bodies at a common temperature, will be found to become completely
U||   fixed in a hot crucible, and not a drop evaporates—being surrounded by
U||   an atmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides. A few
U||   drops of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in
U||   contact with the heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous
U||   acid vapor, and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water
U||   passes off with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by taking
U||   advantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be
U||   turned out a lump of ice from a red-hot vessel.
U||   (*33) The Daguerreotype.
U||   (*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the distance of
U||   61 Cygni (the only star whose distance is ascertained) is so
U||   inconceivably great, that its rays would require more than ten years to
U||   reach the earth. For stars beyond this, 20—or even 1000 years—would be
U||   a moderate estimate. Thus, if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000
U||   years ago, we might still see them to-day by the light which started
U||   from their surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time. That many which
U||   we see daily are really extinct, is not impossible—not even improbable.

U||   the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
U||   all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession.
U||   If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
U||   Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
U||   terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
U||   entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
U||   1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be used
U||   on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree
U||   to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that
U||   you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without
U||   complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C
U||   below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™
U||   electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help
U||   preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. See
U||   paragraph 1.E below.
U||   1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
U||   Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
U||   of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works
U||   in the collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
U||   individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States
U||   and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to
U||   prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or
U||   creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references
U||   to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will
U||   support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to
U||   electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in
U||   compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project
U||   Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily comply with
U||   the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format
U||   with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when you share it
U||   without charge with others.
U||   1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
U||   what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
U||   a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
U||   the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
U||   before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
U||   creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
U||   Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning the
U||   copyright status of any work in any country other than the United
U||   States.
U||   1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
U||   1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
U||   access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear prominently
U||   whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work on which the
U||   phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project
U||   Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
U||   copied or distributed:
U||   This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
U||   most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
U||   restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
U||   under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
U||   eBook or online at [25]www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
U||   United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you
U||   are located before using this eBook.
U||   1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is derived
U||   from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a
U||   notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright
U||   holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United
U||   States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or
U||   providing access to a work with the phrase “Project Gutenberg”
U||   associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with
U||   the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission
U||   for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™ trademark as set
U||   forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
U||   1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
U||   with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
U||   must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
U||   terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked
U||   to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works posted with the
U||   permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
U||   1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
U||   License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
U||   work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
U||   1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
U||   electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
U||   prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
U||   active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
U||   Gutenberg™ License.
U||   1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
U||   compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
U||   any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
U||   to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other
U||   than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version
U||   posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website (www.gutenberg.org),
U||   you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
U||   copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
U||   request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other
U||   form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg™
U||   License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
U||   1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
U||   performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works unless
U||   you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
U||   1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
U||   access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works provided
U||   that:
U||     * • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
U||       the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you
U||       already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to
U||       the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to
U||       donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg
U||       Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within
U||       60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally
U||       required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments
U||       should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg
U||       Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,
U||       “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
U||       Archive Foundation.”
U||     * • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who
U||       notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt
U||       that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project
U||       Gutenberg™ License. You must require such a user to return or
U||       destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and
U||       discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project
U||       Gutenberg™ works.
U||     * • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
U||       any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
U||       electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
U||       receipt of the work.
U||     * • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
U||       distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
U||   1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg™
U||   electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth
U||   in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from the
U||   Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of the
U||   Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in
U||   Section 3 below.
U||   1.F.
U||   1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
U||   effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
U||   works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
U||   Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
U||   electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
U||   contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
U||   or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
U||   intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
U||   other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
U||   be read by your equipment.
U||   1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
U||   of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
U||   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
U||   Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
U||   Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability
U||   to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE
U||   THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF
U||   WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH
U||   1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY
U||   DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL,
U||   DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF
U||   YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
U||   1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
U||   defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
U||   receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
U||   written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
U||   received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
U||   your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
U||   the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
U||   refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
U||   providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
U||   receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
U||   is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
U||   opportunities to fix the problem.
U||   1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
U||   in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER
U||   WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
U||   TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
U||   1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
U||   warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
U||   If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates
U||   the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall
U||   be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted
U||   by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
U||   provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
U||   1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
U||   trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
U||   providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance
U||   with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
U||   promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works,
U||   harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
U||   that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you
U||   do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project
U||   Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or
U||   deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
U||   Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
U||   Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
U||   electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
U||   including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
U||   because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
U||   people in all walks of life.
U||   Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
U||   assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
U||   goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
U||   freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
U||   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
U||   and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To
U||   learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
U||   how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
U||   Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
U||   Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
U||   Foundation
U||   The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
U||   501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state
U||   of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue
U||   Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is
U||   64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
U||   Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S.
U||   federal laws and your state’s laws.
U||   The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
U||   Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
U||   date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and
U||   official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
U||   Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
U||   Literary Archive Foundation
U||   Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
U||   public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
U||   number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
U||   distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of
U||   equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
U||   $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
U||   with the IRS.
U||   The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
U||   charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
U||   States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
U||   considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
U||   with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
U||   we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
U||   DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
U||   state visit [26]www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||   While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
U||   have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
U||   against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
U||   approach us with offers to donate.
U||   International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
U||   statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
U||   the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
U||   Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
U||   methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
U||   including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
U||   please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||   Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic
U||   works
U||   Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
U||   concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
U||   with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
U||   Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
U||   Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
U||   editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
U||   the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
U||   necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
U||   edition.
U||   Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:
U||   [27]www.gutenberg.org.
U||   This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including
U||   how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
U||   Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
U||   our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
