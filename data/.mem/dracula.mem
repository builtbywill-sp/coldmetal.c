U||CHAPTER I
U||JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
U||   (Kept in shorthand.)
U||   3 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at
U||   Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was
U||   an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse
U||   which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through
U||   the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had
U||   arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
U||   impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
U||   East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
U||   here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
U||   rule.
U||   We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
U||   Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
U||   rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
U||   very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter,
U||   and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a
U||   national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
U||   Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed,
U||   I don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.
U||   Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
U||   British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
U||   regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
U||   country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
U||   nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
U||   extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
U||   Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
U||   mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
U||   not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
U||   Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
U||   with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
U||   town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall
U||   enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk
U||   over my travels with Mina.
U||   In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct
U||   nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs,
U||   who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and
U||   Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim
U||   to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the
U||   Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the
U||   Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world
U||   is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the
U||   centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very
U||   interesting. (Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.)
U||   I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
U||   all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
U||   window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
U||   the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
U||   still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the
U||   continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping
U||   soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge
U||   of maize flour which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed
U||   with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.”
U||   (Mem., get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the
U||   train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done
U||   so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the
U||   carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me
U||   that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What
U||   ought they to be in China?
U||   All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
U||   beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
U||   top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
U||   rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
U||   of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
U||   running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
U||   station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
U||   of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
U||   saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round
U||   hats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The
U||   women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very
U||   clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or
U||   other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
U||   fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
U||   were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
U||   Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
U||   hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and
U||   enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with
U||   brass nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into
U||   them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
U||   picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
U||   set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
U||   however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
U||   self-assertion.
U||   It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
U||   very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the
U||   Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very stormy
U||   existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
U||   of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
U||   occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it
U||   underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties
U||   of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.
U||   Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
U||   found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
U||   course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
U||   evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
U||   cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white
U||   undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
U||   fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
U||   said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She
U||   smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
U||   who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned
U||   with a letter:—
U||   “My Friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting you.
U||   Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will start for
U||   Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage
U||   will await you and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from
U||   London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my
U||   beautiful land.
U||   “Your friend,
U||   “Dracula.”
U||   4 May.—I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
U||   directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
U||   making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
U||   pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
U||   true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
U||   answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
U||   lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
U||   way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
U||   was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
U||   tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed
U||   themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused
U||   to speak further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no
U||   time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any
U||   means comforting.
U||   Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in
U||   a very hysterical way:
U||   “Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited
U||   state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew,
U||   and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at
U||   all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I
U||   told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important
U||   business, she asked again:
U||   “Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.
U||   She shook her head as she said again:
U||   “Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On
U||   my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
U||   “It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
U||   the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
U||   full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”
U||   She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
U||   without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
U||   to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
U||   ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
U||   to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
U||   tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
U||   her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
U||   dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
U||   did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
U||   taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
U||   seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such
U||   a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put
U||   the rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went
U||   out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am
U||   waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is
U||   still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many
U||   ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not
U||   know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this
U||   book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here
U||   comes the coach!
U||   5 May. The Castle.—The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
U||   high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees
U||   or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little
U||   are mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
U||   naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put
U||   down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I
U||   left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they
U||   called “robber steak”—bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
U||   pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
U||   style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which
U||   produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
U||   disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.
U||   When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw
U||   him talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for
U||   every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were
U||   sitting on the bench outside the door—which they call by a name meaning
U||   “word-bearer”—came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
U||   pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
U||   there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my
U||   polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they
U||   were not cheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”—Satan,
U||   “pokol”—hell, “stregoica”—witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”—both of which
U||   mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for
U||   something that is either were-wolf or vampire. (Mem., I must ask the
U||   Count about these superstitions)
U||   When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
U||   swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
U||   pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a
U||   fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at
U||   first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
U||   charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,
U||   just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every
U||   one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
U||   could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I
U||   had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
U||   themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background
U||   of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in
U||   the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers
U||   covered the whole front of the box-seat—“gotza” they call them—cracked
U||   his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set
U||   off on our journey.
U||   I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of
U||   the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or
U||   rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not
U||   have been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green
U||   sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep
U||   hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable
U||   end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit
U||   blossom—apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the
U||   green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out
U||   amongst these green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran
U||   the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut
U||   out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down
U||   the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we
U||   seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand
U||   then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing
U||   no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in
U||   summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after
U||   the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run
U||   of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are
U||   not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair
U||   them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in
U||   foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at
U||   loading point.
U||   Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
U||   of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right
U||   and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
U||   them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
U||   deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
U||   grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
U||   pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
U||   the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
U||   mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and
U||   again the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my
U||   arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty,
U||   snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our
U||   serpentine way, to be right before us:—
U||   “Look! Isten szek!”—“God’s seat!”—and he crossed himself reverently.
U||   As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
U||   us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was
U||   emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
U||   sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and
U||   there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I
U||   noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many
U||   crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here
U||   and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did
U||   not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender
U||   of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There
U||   were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and
U||   here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white
U||   stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now
U||   and again we passed a leiter-wagon—the ordinary peasant’s cart—with its
U||   long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
U||   road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
U||   peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their
U||   coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
U||   staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
U||   and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
U||   gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
U||   ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
U||   Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
U||   late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
U||   that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
U||   greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
U||   peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
U||   grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
U||   threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
U||   Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the
U||   hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could
U||   only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at
U||   home, but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must
U||   not walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what
U||   he evidently meant for grim pleasantry—for he looked round to catch the
U||   approving smile of the rest—“and you may have enough of such matters
U||   before you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s
U||   pause to light his lamps.
U||   When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
U||   passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
U||   though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully
U||   with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
U||   to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
U||   patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the
U||   hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
U||   rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a
U||   stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared
U||   to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
U||   side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One
U||   by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
U||   upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
U||   certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
U||   faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of
U||   fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at
U||   Bistritz—the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
U||   Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
U||   passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
U||   darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either
U||   happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would
U||   give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
U||   some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
U||   the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
U||   air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the
U||   mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
U||   into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the
U||   conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to
U||   see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The
U||   only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam
U||   from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the
U||   sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a
U||   vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed
U||   to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best
U||   do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something
U||   which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a
U||   tone; I thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to
U||   me, he said in German worse than my own:—
U||   “There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will
U||   now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
U||   the next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
U||   snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,
U||   amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
U||   of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us,
U||   overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash
U||   of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black
U||   and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown
U||   beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I
U||   could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed
U||   red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:—
U||   “You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:—
U||   “The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:—
U||   “That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You
U||   cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are
U||   swift.” As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking
U||   mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory.
U||   One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger’s
U||   “Lenore”:—
U||   “Denn die Todten reiten schnell”—
U||   (“For the dead travel fast.”)
U||   The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a
U||   gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time
U||   putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s
U||   luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
U||   handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of
U||   the coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me
U||   with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must
U||   have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses
U||   turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I
U||   saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps,
U||   and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing
U||   themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses,
U||   and off they swept on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the
U||   darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but
U||   a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and
U||   the driver said in excellent German:—
U||   “The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take
U||   all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
U||   country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take
U||   any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a
U||   little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been
U||   any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
U||   unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,
U||   then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It
U||   seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground
U||   again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this
U||   was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all
U||   meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I
U||   was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an
U||   intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how
U||   time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my
U||   watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of
U||   shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was
U||   increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of
U||   suspense.
U||   Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road—a
U||   long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by
U||   another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind
U||   which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which
U||   seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination
U||   could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the
U||   horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them
U||   soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though
U||   after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from
U||   the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper
U||   howling—that of wolves—which affected both the horses and myself in the
U||   same way—for I was minded to jump from the calèche and run, whilst they
U||   reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his
U||   great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my
U||   own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became
U||   quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He
U||   petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I
U||   have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for
U||   under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they
U||   still trembled. The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins,
U||   started off at a great pace. This time, after going to the far side of
U||   the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to
U||   the right.
U||   Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over
U||   the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great
U||   frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in
U||   shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled
U||   through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we
U||   swept along. It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow
U||   began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a
U||   white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs,
U||   though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the
U||   wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on
U||   us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my
U||   fear. The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept
U||   turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything
U||   through the darkness.
U||   Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The
U||   driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,
U||   jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know
U||   what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but
U||   while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word
U||   took his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen
U||   asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
U||   endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.
U||   Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
U||   around us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where
U||   the blue flame arose—it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
U||   to illumine the place around it at all—and gathering a few stones,
U||   formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical
U||   effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,
U||   for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but
U||   as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me
U||   straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue
U||   flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
U||   wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.
U||   At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
U||   had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
U||   than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any
U||   cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but
U||   just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind
U||   the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw
U||   around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
U||   with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more
U||   terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they
U||   howled. For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when
U||   a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can
U||   understand their true import.
U||   All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
U||   some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and
U||   looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;
U||   but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
U||   had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for
U||   it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through
U||   the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the
U||   calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
U||   to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know
U||   not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and
U||   looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept
U||   his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the
U||   wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed
U||   across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.
U||   When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and
U||   the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a
U||   dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time
U||   seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
U||   darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on
U||   ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
U||   always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the
U||   driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
U||   vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,
U||   and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
U||   sky.
U||CHAPTER II
U||JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL—continued
U||   5 May.—I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake
U||   I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In the
U||   gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
U||   ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger
U||   than it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.
U||   When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
U||   to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
U||   strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
U||   crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
U||   them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
U||   studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
U||   massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
U||   massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
U||   weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook
U||   the reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared
U||   down one of the dark openings.
U||   I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell
U||   or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark
U||   window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The
U||   time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon
U||   me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
U||   What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a
U||   customary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to
U||   explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s
U||   clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor—for just before leaving
U||   London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a
U||   full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
U||   I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I
U||   expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
U||   the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt
U||   in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the
U||   pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake
U||   and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
U||   wait the coming of the morning.
U||   Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching
U||   behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
U||   light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
U||   massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise
U||   of long disuse, and the great door swung back.
U||   Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
U||   moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck
U||   of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver
U||   lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
U||   throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
U||   open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a
U||   courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange
U||   intonation:—
U||   “Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!” He made no
U||   motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his
U||   gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that
U||   I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and
U||   holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,
U||   an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
U||   ice—more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:—
U||   “Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of
U||   the happiness you bring!” The strength of the handshake was so much
U||   akin to that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not
U||   seen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to
U||   whom I was speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:—
U||   “Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:—
U||   “I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;
U||   the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” As he was
U||   speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
U||   took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I
U||   protested but he insisted:—
U||   “Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
U||   available. Let me see to your comfort myself.” He insisted on carrying
U||   my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and
U||   along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
U||   heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced
U||   to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
U||   and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
U||   flamed and flared.
U||   The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
U||   the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room
U||   lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.
U||   Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter.
U||   It was a welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and
U||   warmed with another log fire,—also added to but lately, for the top
U||   logs were fresh—which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count
U||   himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed
U||   the door:—
U||   “You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
U||   toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come
U||   into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”
U||   The light and warmth and the Count’s courteous welcome seemed to have
U||   dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal
U||   state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a
U||   hasty toilet, I went into the other room.
U||   I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the
U||   great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of
U||   his hand to the table, and said:—
U||   “I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust,
U||   excuse me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do
U||   not sup.”
U||   I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to
U||   me. He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he
U||   handed it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill
U||   of pleasure.
U||   “I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a
U||   constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for
U||   some time to come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient
U||   substitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young
U||   man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful
U||   disposition. He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in
U||   my service. He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his
U||   stay, and shall take your instructions in all matters.”
U||   The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
U||   fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese
U||   and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was
U||   my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many
U||   questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
U||   experienced.
U||   By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had
U||   drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he
U||   offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I
U||   had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked
U||   physiognomy.
U||   His face was a strong—a very strong—aquiline, with high bridge of the
U||   thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead,
U||   and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere.
U||   His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with
U||   bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far
U||   as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
U||   cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
U||   the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
U||   man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
U||   extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
U||   though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.
U||   Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
U||   in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
U||   them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather
U||   coarse—broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in
U||   the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a
U||   sharp point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I
U||   could not repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank,
U||   but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would,
U||   I could not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and
U||   with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his
U||   protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
U||   fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the
U||   window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a
U||   strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from
U||   down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count’s eyes
U||   gleamed, and he said:—
U||   “Listen to them—the children of the night. What music they make!”
U||   Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
U||   added:—
U||   “Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of
U||   the hunter.” Then he rose and said:—
U||   “But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
U||   shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;
U||   so sleep well and dream well!” With a courteous bow, he opened for me
U||   himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....
U||   I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
U||   which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the
U||   sake of those dear to me!
U||   7 May.—It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the
U||   last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
U||   own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had
U||   supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by
U||   the pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on
U||   which was written:—
U||   “I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.—D.” I set to and
U||   enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I
U||   might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.
U||   There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
U||   extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service
U||   is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense
U||   value. The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the
U||   hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and
U||   must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are
U||   centuries old, though in excellent order. I saw something like them in
U||   Hampton Court, but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But
U||   still in none of the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a
U||   toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass
U||   from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair. I have not
U||   yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except
U||   the howling of wolves. Some time after I had finished my meal—I do not
U||   know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five
U||   and six o’clock when I had it—I looked about for something to read, for
U||   I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the Count’s
U||   permission. There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper,
U||   or even writing materials; so I opened another door in the room and
U||   found a sort of library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it
U||   locked.
U||   In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English
U||   books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
U||   newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines
U||   and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books
U||   were of the most varied kind—history, geography, politics, political
U||   economy, botany, geology, law—all relating to England and English life
U||   and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the
U||   London Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the
U||   Army and Navy Lists, and—it somehow gladdened my heart to see it—the
U||   Law List.
U||   Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
U||   entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
U||   night’s rest. Then he went on:—
U||   “I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that
U||   will interest you. These companions”—and he laid his hand on some of
U||   the books—“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
U||   since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
U||   of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and
U||   to know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
U||   your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
U||   humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
U||   it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.
U||   To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.”
U||   “But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!” He bowed
U||   gravely.
U||   “I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet
U||   I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I
U||   know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.”
U||   “Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently.”
U||   “Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your
U||   London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is
U||   not enough for me. Here I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know
U||   me, and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one;
U||   men know him not—and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I
U||   am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his
U||   speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long
U||   master that I would be master still—or at least that none other should
U||   be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
U||   Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You
U||   shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may
U||   learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make
U||   error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to
U||   be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so
U||   many important affairs in hand.”
U||   Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might
U||   come into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes, certainly,” and
U||   added:—
U||   “You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
U||   locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that
U||   all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
U||   my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” I said I was sure
U||   of this, and then he went on:—
U||   “We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are
U||   not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from
U||   what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something
U||   of what strange things there may be.”
U||   This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to
U||   talk, if only for talking’s sake, I asked him many questions regarding
U||   things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.
U||   Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
U||   pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked
U||   most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I
U||   asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
U||   instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the
U||   blue flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that
U||   on a certain night of the year—last night, in fact, when all evil
U||   spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway—a blue flame is seen over
U||   any place where treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been
U||   hidden,” he went on, “in the region through which you came last night,
U||   there can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for
U||   centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is
U||   hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by
U||   the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring
U||   times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the
U||   patriots went out to meet them—men and women, the aged and the children
U||   too—and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they
U||   might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When
U||   the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was
U||   had been sheltered in the friendly soil.”
U||   “But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
U||   there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”
U||   The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
U||   sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:—
U||   “Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames
U||   only appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will,
U||   if he can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he
U||   did he would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell
U||   me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in
U||   daylight even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be
U||   able to find these places again?”
U||   “There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead where even
U||   to look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters.
U||   “Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which you
U||   have procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into
U||   my own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in
U||   order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I
U||   passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
U||   lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also
U||   lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,
U||   reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When
U||   I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him
U||   I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested
U||   in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its
U||   surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the
U||   subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very
U||   much more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:—
U||   “Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there
U||   I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan—nay, pardon me, I
U||   fall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first—my friend
U||   Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will
U||   be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
U||   other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”
U||   We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
U||   Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the
U||   necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to
U||   Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a
U||   place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which
U||   I inscribe here:—
U||   “At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed
U||   to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the
U||   place was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient
U||   structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large
U||   number of years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all
U||   eaten with rust.
U||   “The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre
U||   Face, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
U||   the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
U||   the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which
U||   make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or
U||   small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
U||   flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all
U||   periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone
U||   immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred
U||   with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel
U||   or church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door
U||   leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of
U||   it from various points. The house has been added to, but in a very
U||   straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers,
U||   which must be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one
U||   being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a
U||   private lunatic asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.”
U||   When I had finished, he said:—
U||   “I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to
U||   live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in
U||   a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice
U||   also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love
U||   not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not
U||   gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
U||   sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;
U||   and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
U||   attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
U||   shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
U||   battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would
U||   be alone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his look
U||   did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
U||   smile look malignant and saturnine.
U||   Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers
U||   together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of
U||   the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally
U||   at England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found
U||   in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed
U||   that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new
U||   estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the
U||   Yorkshire coast.
U||   It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. “Aha!” he
U||   said; “still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I
U||   am informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went
U||   into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the
U||   table. The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his
U||   being away from home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted
U||   whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the
U||   Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every
U||   conceivable subject, hour after hour. I felt that it was getting very
U||   late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to
U||   meet my host’s wishes in every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep
U||   yesterday had fortified me; but I could not help experiencing that
U||   chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in
U||   its way, the turn of the tide. They say that people who are near death
U||   die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any
U||   one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced
U||   this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard
U||   the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the
U||   clear morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:—
U||   “Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so
U||   long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
U||   England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by
U||   us,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.
U||   I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
U||   notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the
U||   warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have
U||   written of this day.
U||   8 May.—I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too
U||   diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for
U||   there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
U||   cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had
U||   never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on
U||   me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I
U||   could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak
U||   with, and he!—I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place.
U||   Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up,
U||   and imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me
U||   say at once how I stand—or seem to.
U||   I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could
U||   not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,
U||   and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,
U||   and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started,
U||   for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the
U||   glass covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself
U||   slightly, but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the
U||   Count’s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been
U||   mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man was close to
U||   me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection
U||   of him in the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there
U||   was no sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and,
U||   coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase
U||   that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is
U||   near; but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the
U||   blood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I
U||   did so half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw
U||   my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly
U||   made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string
U||   of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for
U||   the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever
U||   there.
U||   “Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is more
U||   dangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shaving
U||   glass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the
U||   mischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” and
U||   opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung
U||   out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
U||   of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very
U||   annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case
U||   or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.
U||   When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could
U||   not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that
U||   as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very
U||   peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I
U||   went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The
U||   view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every
U||   opportunity of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible
U||   precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet
U||   without touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of
U||   green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm.
U||   Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges
U||   through the forests.
U||   But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view
U||   I explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
U||   bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
U||   an available exit.
U||   The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!
U||CHAPTER III
U||JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL—continued
U||   WHEN I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.
U||   I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
U||   every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my
U||   helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a
U||   few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
U||   as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me
U||   that I was helpless I sat down quietly—as quietly as I have ever done
U||   anything in my life—and began to think over what was best to be done. I
U||   am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of
U||   one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to
U||   the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it
U||   himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only
U||   deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see,
U||   my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and
U||   my eyes open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my
U||   own fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so,
U||   I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.
U||   I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below
U||   shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once
U||   into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him
U||   making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along
U||   thought—that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him
U||   through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
U||   dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these
U||   menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do
U||   them. This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle,
U||   it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach
U||   that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does
U||   it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up
U||   his hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on
U||   the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the
U||   crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless
U||   that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
U||   comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a
U||   thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as
U||   idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it
U||   that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it
U||   is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and
U||   comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to
U||   make up my mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can
U||   about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may
U||   talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very
U||   careful, however, not to awake his suspicion.
U||   Midnight.—I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few
U||   questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject
U||   wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of
U||   battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he
U||   afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house
U||   and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
U||   fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said “we,”
U||   and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could
U||   put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most
U||   fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He
U||   grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
U||   white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as
U||   though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I
U||   shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of
U||   his race:—
U||   “We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
U||   of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,
U||   in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from
U||   Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their
U||   Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe,
U||   ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the
U||   were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found
U||   the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,
U||   till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
U||   old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in
U||   the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as
U||   Attila, whose blood is in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it a
U||   wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when
U||   the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his
U||   thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when
U||   Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found
U||   us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was
U||   completed there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the
U||   Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us
U||   for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land;
U||   ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the
U||   Turks say, ‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ Who more gladly than
U||   we throughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its
U||   warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was
U||   redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the
U||   flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who
U||   was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and
U||   beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it
U||   that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to
U||   the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this
U||   Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age
U||   again and again brought his forces over the great river into
U||   Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and
U||   again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his
U||   troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could
U||   ultimately triumph! They said that he thought only of himself. Bah!
U||   what good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war without a
U||   brain and heart to conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács,
U||   we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst
U||   their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free.
U||   Ah, young sir, the Szekelys—and the Dracula as their heart’s blood,
U||   their brains, and their swords—can boast a record that mushroom growths
U||   like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days
U||   are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable
U||   peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”
U||   It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (Mem., this
U||   diary seems horribly like the beginning of the “Arabian Nights,” for
U||   everything has to break off at cockcrow—or like the ghost of Hamlet’s
U||   father.)
U||   12 May.—Let me begin with facts—bare, meagre facts, verified by books
U||   and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not confuse
U||   them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation, or
U||   my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from his room he
U||   began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of
U||   certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over books, and,
U||   simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had
U||   been examining at Lincoln’s Inn. There was a certain method in the
U||   Count’s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence; the
U||   knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.
U||   First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more.
U||   I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be
U||   wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as
U||   only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to
U||   militate against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and
U||   went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one
U||   man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in
U||   case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking
U||   solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by
U||   any chance mislead him, so he said:—
U||   “I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from
U||   under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far
U||   from London, buys for me through your good self my place at London.
U||   Good! Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange
U||   that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead
U||   of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest
U||   might be served save my wish only; and as one of London residence
U||   might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went
U||   thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my
U||   interest. Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods,
U||   say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be
U||   that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these
U||   ports?” I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we
U||   solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work
U||   could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the
U||   client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his
U||   wishes carried out by him without further trouble.
U||   “But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?”
U||   “Of course,” I replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who
U||   do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”
U||   “Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
U||   consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
U||   difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
U||   against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
U||   and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a
U||   wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or
U||   foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not
U||   evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
U||   wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he
U||   had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books
U||   available, he suddenly stood up and said:—
U||   “Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter
U||   Hawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart that
U||   I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity
U||   of sending letters to anybody.
U||   “Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand on my
U||   shoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
U||   please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.”
U||   “Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at
U||   the thought.
U||   “I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,
U||   employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his
U||   behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I
U||   have not stinted. Is it not so?”
U||   What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not
U||   mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count
U||   Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
U||   which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I
U||   could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his
U||   mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them,
U||   but in his own smooth, resistless way:—
U||   “I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of
U||   things other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please
U||   your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to
U||   getting home to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three
U||   sheets of note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest
U||   foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet
U||   smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I
U||   understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I
U||   wrote, for he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only
U||   formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also
U||   to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the
U||   Count, if he did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet,
U||   reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he
U||   wrote them to some books on his table. Then he took up my two and
U||   placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after
U||   which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and
U||   looked at the letters, which were face down on the table. I felt no
U||   compunction in doing so, for under the circumstances I felt that I
U||   should protect myself in every way I could.
U||   One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The
U||   Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to
U||   Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,
U||   bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just
U||   about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in
U||   my seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been
U||   and to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in
U||   his hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and
U||   stamped them carefully, and then turning to me, said:—
U||   “I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private
U||   this evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.” At the
U||   door he turned, and after a moment’s pause said:—
U||   “Let me advise you, my dear young friend—nay, let me warn you with all
U||   seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
U||   chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has
U||   many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.
U||   Be warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do,
U||   then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will
U||   then be safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then”—He
U||   finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands
U||   as if he were washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to
U||   whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible
U||   net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me.
U||   Later.—I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
U||   doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
U||   not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed—I imagine that
U||   my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.
U||   When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing
U||   any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look
U||   out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast
U||   expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow
U||   darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was
U||   indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it
U||   were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell
U||   on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full
U||   of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for
U||   my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the
U||   beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost
U||   as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and
U||   the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere
U||   beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath
U||   I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something
U||   moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined,
U||   from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count’s own room
U||   would look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep,
U||   stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was
U||   evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back behind
U||   the stonework, and looked carefully out.
U||   What I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window. I did not
U||   see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
U||   back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had
U||   had so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and
U||   somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
U||   and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to
U||   repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
U||   window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful
U||   abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great
U||   wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some
U||   trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept
U||   looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp
U||   the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of
U||   years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards
U||   with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.
U||   What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
U||   semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
U||   me; I am in fear—in awful fear—and there is no escape for me; I am
U||   encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....
U||   15 May.—Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.
U||   He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a
U||   good deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his
U||   head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without
U||   avail—the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I
U||   knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
U||   explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room,
U||   and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had
U||   expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the
U||   stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I
U||   could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains;
U||   but the door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the
U||   Count’s room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may
U||   get it and escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the
U||   various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from
U||   them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was
U||   nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and
U||   moth-eaten. At last, however, I found one door at the top of the
U||   stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under
U||   pressure. I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked,
U||   but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen
U||   somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor. Here was an
U||   opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with
U||   many efforts forced it back so that I could enter. I was now in a wing
U||   of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey
U||   lower down. From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay
U||   along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking
U||   out both west and south. On the latter side, as well as to the former,
U||   there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a
U||   great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great
U||   windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not
U||   reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position
U||   which had to be guarded, were secured. To the west was a great valley,
U||   and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising
U||   peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose
U||   roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone. This was
U||   evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone
U||   days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen.
U||   The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in
U||   through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it
U||   softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some
U||   measure the ravages of time and the moth. My lamp seemed to be of
U||   little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it
U||   with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my
U||   heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living
U||   alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the
U||   Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft
U||   quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where
U||   in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and
U||   many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in
U||   shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is
U||   nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my
U||   senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
U||   which mere “modernity” cannot kill.
U||   Later: the Morning of 16 May.—God preserve my sanity, for to this I am
U||   reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
U||   Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may
U||   not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely
U||   it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
U||   hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone
U||   I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his
U||   purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way
U||   lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which
U||   have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant
U||   when he made Hamlet say:—
U||   “My tablets! quick, my tablets!
U||   ’Tis meet that I put it down,” etc.,
U||   for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the
U||   shock had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for
U||   repose. The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.
U||   The Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens
U||   me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold
U||   upon me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!
U||   When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book
U||   and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count’s warning came into my
U||   mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was
U||   upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The
U||   soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of
U||   freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the
U||   gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
U||   and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
U||   their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great
U||   couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look
U||   at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring
U||   for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen
U||   asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly
U||   real—so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
U||   morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.
U||   I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I
U||   came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
U||   my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of
U||   dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by
U||   their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming
U||   when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
U||   no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for
U||   some time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high
U||   aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that
U||   seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The
U||   other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden
U||   hair and eyes like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face,
U||   and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not
U||   recollect at the moment how or where. All three had brilliant white
U||   teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips.
U||   There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at
U||   the same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning
U||   desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to
U||   note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her
U||   pain; but it is the truth. They whispered together, and then they all
U||   three laughed—such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the
U||   sound never could have come through the softness of human lips. It was
U||   like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played
U||   on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and
U||   the other two urged her on. One said:—
U||   “Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
U||   begin.” The other added:—
U||   “He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet,
U||   looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
U||   The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement
U||   of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent
U||   the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter
U||   underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.
U||   I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly
U||   under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
U||   gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both
U||   thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked
U||   her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture
U||   shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the
U||   white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below
U||   the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat.
U||   Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as
U||   it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck.
U||   Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the
U||   hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer—nearer. I could feel the
U||   soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my
U||   throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and
U||   pausing there. I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and
U||   waited—waited with beating heart.
U||   But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as
U||   lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his
U||   being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily
U||   I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
U||   giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
U||   white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
U||   passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even
U||   to the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red
U||   light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind
U||   them. His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like
U||   drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like
U||   a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he
U||   hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though
U||   he were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had
U||   seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a
U||   whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he
U||   said:—
U||   “How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when
U||   I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me!
U||   Beware how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The
U||   fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:—
U||   “You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women
U||   joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
U||   room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
U||   of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
U||   and said in a soft whisper:—
U||   “Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it
U||   not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall
U||   kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work
U||   to be done.”
U||   “Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh,
U||   as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which
U||   moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he
U||   nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my
U||   ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a
U||   half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with
U||   horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
U||   bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me
U||   without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
U||   moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the
U||   dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.
U||   Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.
U||CHAPTER IV
U||JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL—continued
U||   I AWOKE in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must
U||   have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
U||   could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were
U||   certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid
U||   by in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and
U||   I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to
U||   bed, and many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may
U||   have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause
U||   or another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of
U||   one thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and
U||   undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are
U||   intact. I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he
U||   would not have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look
U||   round this room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now
U||   a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful
U||   women, who were—who are—waiting to suck my blood.
U||   18 May.—I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I
U||   must know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs
U||   I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that
U||   part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt of the
U||   lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside. I
U||   fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.
U||   19 May.—I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in the
U||   suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was
U||   nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,
U||   another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the
U||   letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
U||   Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present
U||   state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count
U||   whilst I am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to
U||   excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too
U||   much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only
U||   chance is to prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will
U||   give me a chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that
U||   gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from
U||   him. He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my
U||   writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me
U||   with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later
U||   letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case
U||   chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would
U||   have been to create new suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in
U||   with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters.
U||   He calculated a minute, and then said:—
U||   “The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June
U||   29.”
U||   I know now the span of my life. God help me!
U||   28 May.—There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
U||   send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are
U||   encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of
U||   them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though
U||   allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands
U||   of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
U||   They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar, and call
U||   themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion, save
U||   superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany
U||   tongue.
U||   I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
U||   posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin
U||   acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many
U||   signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could
U||   their spoken language....
U||   I have written the letters. Mina’s is in shorthand, and I simply ask
U||   Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my
U||   situation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would
U||   shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her.
U||   Should the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my
U||   secret or the extent of my knowledge....
U||   I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window
U||   with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The
U||   man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put
U||   them in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and
U||   began to read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....
U||   The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
U||   voice as he opened two letters:—
U||   “The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they
U||   come, I shall, of course, take care. See!”—he must have looked at
U||   it—“one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other”—here he
U||   caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and the
U||   dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly—“the other
U||   is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is not
U||   signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.” And he calmly held letter and
U||   envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he went
U||   on:—
U||   “The letter to Hawkins—that I shall, of course, send on, since it is
U||   yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that
U||   unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?” He held
U||   out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean
U||   envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When
U||   he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute
U||   later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.
U||   When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his
U||   coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very
U||   courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been
U||   sleeping, he said:—
U||   “So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I
U||   may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many
U||   labours to me; but you will sleep, I pray.” I passed to my room and
U||   went to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has
U||   its own calms.
U||   31 May.—This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself with
U||   some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
U||   that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a
U||   surprise, again a shock!
U||   Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
U||   relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
U||   might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and
U||   pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made
U||   search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my
U||   clothes.
U||   The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
U||   rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new
U||   scheme of villainy....
U||   17 June.—This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
U||   cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding
U||   and scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
U||   With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
U||   leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
U||   each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
U||   sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I
U||   ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
U||   main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a
U||   shock: my door was fastened on the outside.
U||   Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me
U||   stupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came
U||   out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which
U||   they laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised
U||   entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.
U||   The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
U||   rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks
U||   handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When
U||   they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the
U||   yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on
U||   it for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head. Shortly afterwards,
U||   I heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.
U||   24 June, before morning.—Last night the Count left me early, and locked
U||   himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the winding
U||   stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I thought I
U||   would watch for the Count, for there is something going on. The Szgany
U||   are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind.
U||   I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound as of
U||   mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
U||   ruthless villainy.
U||   I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw
U||   something coming out of the Count’s window. I drew back and watched
U||   carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to
U||   find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst
U||   travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I
U||   had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
U||   and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he
U||   will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave
U||   evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
U||   letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local
U||   people be attributed to me.
U||   It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up
U||   here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law
U||   which is even a criminal’s right and consolation.
U||   I thought I would watch for the Count’s return, and for a long time sat
U||   doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some
U||   quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were
U||   like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
U||   clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of
U||   soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the
U||   embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more
U||   fully the aërial gambolling.
U||   Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere
U||   far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it
U||   seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new
U||   shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself
U||   struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was
U||   struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to
U||   answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced
U||   the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the
U||   mass of gloom beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to
U||   take dim phantom shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full
U||   possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom
U||   shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams,
U||   were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and
U||   felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and
U||   where the lamp was burning brightly.
U||   When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the
U||   Count’s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
U||   there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a
U||   beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and
U||   could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.
U||   As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without—the agonised cry of a
U||   woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
U||   the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
U||   hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning
U||   against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she
U||   threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:—
U||   “Monster, give me my child!”
U||   She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the
U||   same words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and
U||   beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of
U||   extravagant emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I
U||   could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against
U||   the door.
U||   Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of
U||   the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be
U||   answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many
U||   minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when
U||   liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.
U||   There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
U||   short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.
U||   I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and
U||   she was better dead.
U||   What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful
U||   thing of night and gloom and fear?
U||   25 June, morning.—No man knows till he has suffered from the night how
U||   sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the
U||   sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
U||   gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
U||   as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as
U||   if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must
U||   take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last
U||   night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that
U||   fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from
U||   the earth.
U||   Let me not think of it. Action!
U||   It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or
U||   threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen
U||   the Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake,
U||   that he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his
U||   room! But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way
U||   for me.
U||   Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone
U||   why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his
U||   window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The
U||   chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall
U||   risk it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man’s death is not a
U||   calf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me
U||   in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and
U||   second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!
U||   Same day, later.—I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come
U||   safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I went
U||   whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side,
U||   and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around
U||   the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut, and the
U||   mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I took off
U||   my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down once, so
U||   as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not
U||   overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty
U||   well the direction and distance of the Count’s window, and made for it
U||   as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did
U||   not feel dizzy—I suppose I was too excited—and the time seemed
U||   ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and
U||   trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when
U||   I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked
U||   around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a
U||   discovery. The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things,
U||   which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the
U||   same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I
U||   looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it
U||   anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
U||   corner—gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and
U||   Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as
U||   though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was
U||   less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and
U||   ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.
U||   At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I
U||   could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
U||   was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or
U||   all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone
U||   passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,
U||   minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only
U||   lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,
U||   tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the
U||   odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the
U||   smell grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which
U||   stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had
U||   evidently been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two
U||   places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been
U||   dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those
U||   which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I
U||   made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went
U||   over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down
U||   even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so
U||   was a dread to my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing
U||   except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third,
U||   however, I made a discovery.
U||   There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on
U||   a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep,
U||   I could not say which—for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
U||   glassiness of death—and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
U||   their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of
U||   movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over
U||   him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have
U||   lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few
U||   hours. By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here
U||   and there. I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to
U||   search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a
U||   look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from
U||   the place, and leaving the Count’s room by the window, crawled again up
U||   the castle wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed
U||   and tried to think....
U||   29 June.—To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken
U||   steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the
U||   castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,
U||   lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I
U||   might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man’s
U||   hand would have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return,
U||   for I feared to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library,
U||   and read there till I fell asleep.
U||   I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can
U||   look as he said:—
U||   “To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful
U||   England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never
U||   meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be
U||   here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the
U||   Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
U||   Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
U||   bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to
U||   Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle
U||   Dracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
U||   Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
U||   connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:—
U||   “Why may I not go to-night?”
U||   “Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”
U||   “But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.” He
U||   smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was
U||   some trick behind his smoothness. He said:—
U||   “And your baggage?”
U||   “I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”
U||   The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub
U||   my eyes, it seemed so real:—
U||   “You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit
U||   is that which rules our boyars: ‘Welcome the coming; speed the parting
U||   guest.’ Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait
U||   in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that
U||   you so suddenly desire it. Come!” With a stately gravity, he, with the
U||   lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he
U||   stopped.
U||   “Hark!”
U||   Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the
U||   sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great
U||   orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause
U||   of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
U||   the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
U||   open.
U||   To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I
U||   looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.
U||   As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew
U||   louder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their
U||   blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I
U||   knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless.
U||   With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still
U||   the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count’s body stood in
U||   the gap. Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means
U||   of my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation.
U||   There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the
U||   Count, and as a last chance I cried out:—
U||   “Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my
U||   hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his
U||   powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts
U||   clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their
U||   places.
U||   In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went
U||   to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his
U||   hand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile
U||   that Judas in hell might be proud of.
U||   When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a
U||   whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears
U||   deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:—
U||   “Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have
U||   patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!” There was a low,
U||   sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw
U||   without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they
U||   all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.
U||   I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near
U||   the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am
U||   dear!
U||   30 June, morning.—These may be the last words I ever write in this
U||   diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself
U||   on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me
U||   ready.
U||   At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
U||   had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.
U||   With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had
U||   seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With
U||   hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back
U||   the massive bolts.
U||   But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled,
U||   at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
U||   casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left
U||   the Count.
U||   Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I
U||   determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’s
U||   room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
U||   evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
U||   down the wall, as before, into the Count’s room. It was empty, but that
U||   was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
U||   remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding
U||   stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well
U||   enough where to find the monster I sought.
U||   The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the
U||   lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in
U||   their places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the
U||   key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I
U||   saw something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the
U||   Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white
U||   hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were
U||   fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was
U||   redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which
U||   trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck.
U||   Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the
U||   lids and pouches underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole
U||   awful creature were simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy
U||   leech, exhausted with his repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to
U||   touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to
U||   search, or I was lost. The coming night might see my own body a banquet
U||   in a similar way to those horrid three. I felt all over the body, but
U||   no sign could I find of the key. Then I stopped and looked at the
U||   Count. There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to
U||   drive me mad. This was the being I was helping to transfer to London,
U||   where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming
U||   millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and
U||   ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very
U||   thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world
U||   of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a
U||   shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting
U||   it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I
U||   did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their
U||   blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the
U||   shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a
U||   deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the
U||   box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of
U||   the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight.
U||   The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed
U||   with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost
U||   hell.
U||   I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
U||   on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I
U||   waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
U||   closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
U||   cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had
U||   spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which
U||   contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s
U||   room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
U||   With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of
U||   the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There
U||   must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one
U||   of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping
U||   and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned
U||   to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new
U||   entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of
U||   wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set
U||   the dust from the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found
U||   that it was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of
U||   doom was closing round me more closely.
U||   As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet
U||   and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
U||   with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the
U||   box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again
U||   along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.
U||   The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key
U||   in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
U||   shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.
U||   Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
U||   the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the
U||   distance.
U||   I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a
U||   woman, and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!
U||   I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle
U||   wall farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold
U||   with me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful
U||   place.
U||   And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
U||   from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
U||   children still walk with earthly feet!
U||   At least God’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
U||   precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep—as a man.
U||   Good-bye, all! Mina!
U||CHAPTER V
U||   Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra.
U||   “9 May.
U||   “My dearest Lucy,—
U||   “Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
U||   with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
U||   I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
U||   freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard
U||   lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have
U||   been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall
U||   be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I
U||   can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him
U||   on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He and I
U||   sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic
U||   journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I shall keep a diary
U||   in the same way. I don’t mean one of those
U||   two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
U||   sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not
U||   suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
U||   intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it
U||   anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try
U||   to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
U||   descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with
U||   a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
U||   said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
U||   plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan
U||   from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I
U||   am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange
U||   countries. I wonder if we—I mean Jonathan and I—shall ever see them
U||   together. There is the ten o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye.
U||   “Your loving
U||   “Mina.
U||   “Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for
U||   a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,
U||   curly-haired man???”
U||   Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray.
U||   “17, Chatham Street,
U||   “Wednesday.
U||   “My dearest Mina,—
U||   “I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I
U||   wrote to you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only your
U||   second. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing to
U||   interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal to
U||   picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the tall,
U||   curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the last
U||   Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr. Holmwood.
U||   He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well together;
U||   they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some time ago
U||   a man that would just do for you, if you were not already engaged to
U||   Jonathan. He is an excellent parti, being handsome, well off, and of
U||   good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He is only
U||   nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own
U||   care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us,
U||   and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever
U||   saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I can
U||   fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has a
U||   curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read
U||   one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter
U||   myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do
U||   you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can tell you it is not
U||   a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
U||   have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological
U||   study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient
U||   interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a
U||   bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.
U||   There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
U||   since we were children; we have slept together and eaten together, and
U||   laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like
U||   to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I love him. I am blushing
U||   as I write, for although I think he loves me, he has not told me so in
U||   words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that
U||   does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
U||   undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.
U||   I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,
U||   or I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I do so
U||   want to tell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all
U||   that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in
U||   your prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.
U||   “LUCY.
U||   “P.S.—I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.
U||   “L.”
U||   Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray.
U||   “24 May.
U||   “My dearest Mina,—
U||   “Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so
U||   nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.
U||   “My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.
U||   Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a
U||   proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.
U||   Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel sorry,
U||   really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so
U||   happy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three proposals!
U||   But, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be
U||   getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
U||   and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
U||   least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged
U||   and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
U||   despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must
U||   keep it a secret, dear, from every one, except, of course, Jonathan.
U||   You will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly
U||   tell Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything—don’t you
U||   think so, dear?—and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their
U||   wives, to be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not
U||   always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came
U||   just before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the
U||   lunatic-asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was
U||   very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently
U||   been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered
U||   them; but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men
U||   don’t generally do when they are cool, and then when he wanted to
U||   appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me
U||   nearly scream. He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me
U||   how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his
U||   life would be with me to help and cheer him. He was going to tell me
U||   how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me
U||   cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present
U||   trouble. Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time; and
U||   when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation
U||   he asked me if I cared already for any one else. He put it very nicely,
U||   saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to
U||   know, because if a woman’s heart was free a man might have hope. And
U||   then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one.
U||   I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very
U||   strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped
U||   I would be happy, and that if I ever wanted a friend I must count him
U||   one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t help crying: and you must excuse
U||   this letter being all blotted. Being proposed to is all very nice and
U||   all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at all a happy thing when you have
U||   to see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and
U||   looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what he may say
U||   at the moment, you are passing quite out of his life. My dear, I must
U||   stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.
U||   “Evening.
U||   “Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left
U||   off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number
U||   Two came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas,
U||   and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that
U||   he has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise
U||   with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her
U||   ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that
U||   we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now
U||   what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No,
U||   I don’t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur
U||   never told any, and yet—— My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey
U||   P. Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl
U||   alone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twice to make a chance, and I
U||   helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell
U||   you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang—that is to
U||   say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really
U||   well educated and has exquisite manners—but he found out that it amused
U||   me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and
U||   there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid,
U||   my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever
U||   else he has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself
U||   if I shall ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I
U||   have never heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside
U||   me and looked as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the
U||   same that he was very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so
U||   sweetly:—
U||   “‘Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of your
U||   little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you
U||   will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won’t
U||   you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road
U||   together, driving in double harness?’
U||   “Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem
U||   half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as
U||   lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that
U||   I wasn’t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken
U||   in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing
U||   so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him.
U||   He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t help
U||   feeling a bit serious too—I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid
U||   flirt—though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was
U||   number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he
U||   began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very
U||   heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall
U||   never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,
U||   because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face
U||   which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of
U||   manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:—
U||   “‘Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here
U||   speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right
U||   through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow
U||   to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is
U||   I’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will
U||   let me, a very faithful friend.’
U||   “My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
U||   of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true
U||   gentleman. I burst into tears—I am afraid, my dear, you will think this
U||   a very sloppy letter in more ways than one—and I really felt very
U||   badly. Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want
U||   her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say
U||   it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into
U||   Mr. Morris’s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:—
U||   “‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he
U||   even loves me.’ I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
U||   light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine—I
U||   think I put them into his—and said in a hearty way:—
U||   “‘That’s my brave girl. It’s better worth being late for a chance of
U||   winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don’t
U||   cry, my dear. If it’s for me, I’m a hard nut to crack; and I take it
U||   standing up. If that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well,
U||   he’d better look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. Little
U||   girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that’s rarer
U||   than a lover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I’m going to have a
U||   pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you give me one
U||   kiss? It’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You
U||   can, you know, if you like, for that other good fellow—he must be a
U||   good fellow, my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love
U||   him—hasn’t spoken yet.’ That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and
U||   sweet of him, and noble, too, to a rival—wasn’t it?—and he so sad; so I
U||   leant over and kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as
U||   he looked down into my face—I am afraid I was blushing very much—he
U||   said:—
U||   “‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these
U||   things don’t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your
U||   sweet honesty to me, and good-bye.’ He wrung my hand, and taking up his
U||   hat, went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear
U||   or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man
U||   like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
U||   worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free—only
U||   I don’t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I
U||   cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I
U||   don’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.
U||   “Ever your loving
U||   “Lucy.
U||   “P.S.—Oh, about number Three—I needn’t tell you of number Three, need
U||   I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his
U||   coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was
U||   kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don’t know what I have done to
U||   deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not
U||   ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a
U||   lover, such a husband, and such a friend.
U||   “Good-bye.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   (Kept in phonograph)
U||   25 May.—Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so diary
U||   instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling;
U||   nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the
U||   doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work,
U||   I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has afforded me
U||   a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am determined to
U||   understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get nearer than
U||   ever before to the heart of his mystery.
U||   I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making
U||   myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing
U||   it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep
U||   him to the point of his madness—a thing which I avoid with the patients
U||   as I would the mouth of hell.
U||   (Mem., under what circumstances would I not avoid the pit of hell?)
U||   Omnia Romæ venalia sunt. Hell has its price! verb. sap. If there be
U||   anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it
U||   afterwards accurately, so I had better commence to do so, therefore—
U||   R. M. Renfield, ætat 59.—Sanguine temperament; great physical strength;
U||   morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I
U||   cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
U||   disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly
U||   dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution
U||   is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think
U||   of on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force
U||   is balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the
U||   fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a
U||   series of accidents can balance it.
U||   Letter, Quincey P. Morris to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.
U||   “25 May.
U||   “My dear Art,—
U||   “We’ve told yarns by the camp-fire in the prairies; and dressed one
U||   another’s wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas; and drunk
U||   healths on the shore of Titicaca. There are more yarns to be told, and
U||   other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk. Won’t you
U||   let this be at my camp-fire to-morrow night? I have no hesitation in
U||   asking you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain
U||   dinner-party, and that you are free. There will only be one other, our
U||   old pal at the Korea, Jack Seward. He’s coming, too, and we both want
U||   to mingle our weeps over the wine-cup, and to drink a health with all
U||   our hearts to the happiest man in all the wide world, who has won the
U||   noblest heart that God has made and the best worth winning. We promise
U||   you a hearty welcome, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as
U||   your own right hand. We shall both swear to leave you at home if you
U||   drink too deep to a certain pair of eyes. Come!

U||CHAPTER VI
U||MINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL
U||   24 July. Whitby.—Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
U||   lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
U||   which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the
U||   Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near
U||   the harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through
U||   which the view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley
U||   is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high
U||   land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near
U||   enough to see down. The houses of the old town—the side away from
U||   us—are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow,
U||   like the pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin
U||   of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene
U||   of part of “Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a
U||   most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic
U||   bits; there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the
U||   windows. Between it and the town there is another church, the parish
U||   one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to
U||   my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and
U||   has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland
U||   called Kettleness stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply
U||   over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the
U||   graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the
U||   graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks,
U||   with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit
U||   there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the
U||   breeze. I shall come and sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I
U||   am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of
U||   three old men who are sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all
U||   day but sit up here and talk.
U||   The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
U||   stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in
U||   the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along
U||   outside of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked
U||   inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers
U||   there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.
U||   It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
U||   nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
U||   banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
U||   side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
U||   which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
U||   it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
U||   mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is
U||   lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he
U||   is coming this way....
U||   He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all
U||   gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is
U||   nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing
U||   fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical
U||   person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady
U||   at the abbey he said very brusquely:—
U||   “I wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.
U||   Mind, I don’t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn’t in
U||   my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an’ the like,
U||   but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and
U||   Leeds that be always eatin’ cured herrin’s an’ drinkin’ tea an’ lookin’
U||   out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel’ who’d be
U||   bothered tellin’ lies to them—even the newspapers, which is full of
U||   fool-talk.” I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting
U||   things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about
U||   the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to
U||   begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and
U||   said:—
U||   “I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn’t like
U||   to be kept waitin’ when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to
U||   crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of ’em; an’, miss, I lack
U||   belly-timber sairly by the clock.”
U||   He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could,
U||   down the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead
U||   from the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them—I do not
U||   know how many—and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so
U||   gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they
U||   must originally have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go
U||   home too. Lucy went out visiting with her mother, and as they were only
U||   duty calls, I did not go. They will be home by this.
U||   1 August.—I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most
U||   interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
U||   and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should
U||   think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not
U||   admit anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can’t out-argue them he
U||   bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his
U||   views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has
U||   got a beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old
U||   men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat
U||   down. She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love
U||   with her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict
U||   her, but gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the
U||   legends, and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to
U||   remember it and put it down:—
U||   “It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’
U||   nowt else. These bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ bogles
U||   an’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women
U||   a-belderin’. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an’ all grims an’ signs
U||   an’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’
U||   railway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to do
U||   somethin’ that they don’t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think
U||   o’ them. Why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paper
U||   an’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on the
U||   tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
U||   steans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
U||   is acant—simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on
U||   them, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred to the memory’ wrote on all of
U||   them, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t no bodies at all; an’
U||   the memories of them bean’t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less
U||   sacred. Lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! My
U||   gog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they
U||   come tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’
U||   to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of
U||   them trimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy
U||   from lyin’ in the sea that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”
U||   I could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way in
U||   which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was
U||   “showing off,” so I put in a word to keep him going:—
U||   “Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not
U||   all wrong?”
U||   “Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they make
U||   out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be
U||   like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies.
U||   Now look you here; you come here a stranger, an’ you see this
U||   kirk-garth.” I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did
U||   not quite understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with
U||   the church. He went on: “And you consate that all these steans be aboon
U||   folk that be happed here, snod an’ snog?” I assented again. “Then that
U||   be just where the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds
U||   that be toom as old Dun’s ’bacca-box on Friday night.” He nudged one of
U||   his companions, and they all laughed. “And my gog! how could they be
U||   otherwise? Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!”
U||   I went over and read:—
U||   “Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast
U||   of Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30.” When I came back Mr. Swales went on:—
U||   “Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the
U||   coast of Andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name
U||   ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above”—he pointed
U||   northwards—“or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the
U||   steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of
U||   the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey—I knew his father, lost in
U||   the Lively off Greenland in ’20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the
U||   same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year
U||   later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
U||   in the Gulf of Finland in ’50. Do ye think that all these men will have
U||   to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums
U||   aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’
U||   jostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like a fight up on the ice
U||   in the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’
U||   tryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” This
U||   was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and
U||   his cronies joined in with gusto.
U||   “But,” I said, “surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
U||   assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
U||   take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think
U||   that will be really necessary?”
U||   “Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!”
U||   “To please their relatives, I suppose.”
U||   “To please their relatives, you suppose!” This he said with intense
U||   scorn. “How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
U||   over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?” He
U||   pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on
U||   which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “Read the
U||   lies on that thruff-stean,” he said. The letters were upside down to me
U||   from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over
U||   and read:—
U||   “Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a
U||   glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
U||   Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
U||   beloved son. ‘He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.’
U||   Really, Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in that!” She spoke
U||   her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.
U||   “Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that’s because ye don’t gawm the
U||   sorrowin’ mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was
U||   acrewk’d—a regular lamiter he was—an’ he hated her so that he committed
U||   suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on his
U||   life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they
U||   had for scarin’ the crows with. ’Twarn’t for crows then, for it brought
U||   the clegs and the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off the rocks.
U||   And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often heard him say
U||   masel’ that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious that
U||   she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle where she
U||   was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”—he hammered it with his stick as
U||   he spoke—“a pack of lies? and won’t it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie
U||   comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump, and
U||   asks it to be took as evidence!”
U||   I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she
U||   said, rising up:—
U||   “Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot
U||   leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a
U||   suicide.”
U||   “That won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor Geordie gladsome
U||   to have so trim a lass sittin’ on his lap. That won’t hurt ye. Why,
U||   I’ve sat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done
U||   me no harm. Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’
U||   lie there either! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see
U||   the tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a
U||   stubble-field. There’s the clock, an’ I must gang. My service to ye,
U||   ladies!” And off he hobbled.
U||   Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
U||   took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and
U||   their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I
U||   haven’t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.
U||   The same day. I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no
U||   letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with
U||   Jonathan. The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered
U||   all over the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and
U||   sometimes singly; they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve
U||   of the valley. To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof
U||   of the old house next the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in
U||   the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of a donkey’s hoofs
U||   up the paved road below. The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz
U||   in good time, and further along the quay there is a Salvation Army
U||   meeting in a back street. Neither of the bands hears the other, but up
U||   here I hear and see them both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is
U||   thinking of me! I wish he were here.
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   5 June.—The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to
U||   understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;
U||   selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the
U||   object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
U||   but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of
U||   animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I
U||   sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd
U||   sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a
U||   quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he
U||   did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in
U||   simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: “May I have
U||   three days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, I said that would do.
U||   I must watch him.
U||   18 June.—He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
U||   very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and
U||   the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
U||   has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
U||   room.
U||   1 July.—His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies,
U||   and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked very sad
U||   at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all events.
U||   He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time as
U||   before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a
U||   horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
U||   he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger
U||   and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his
U||   mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it
U||   was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
U||   gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must
U||   watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep
U||   problem in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is
U||   always jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses
U||   of figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
U||   totals added in batches again, as though he were “focussing” some
U||   account, as the auditors put it.
U||   8 July.—There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
U||   my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,
U||   unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
U||   conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I
U||   might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were
U||   except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He
U||   has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His
U||   means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished.
U||   Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the
U||   flies by tempting them with his food.
U||   19 July.—We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of
U||   sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came
U||   in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour—a very,
U||   very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked
U||   him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and
U||   bearing:—
U||   “A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,
U||   and teach, and feed—and feed—and feed!” I was not unprepared for this
U||   request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
U||   vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
U||   should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
U||   I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have
U||   a cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:—
U||   “Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should
U||   refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?” I shook
U||   my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible,
U||   but that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning
U||   of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which
U||   meant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test
U||   him with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall
U||   know more.
U||   10 p. m.—I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner
U||   brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and
U||   implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
U||   I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon
U||   he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the
U||   corner where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.
U||   20 July.—Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his
U||   rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his
U||   sugar, which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning
U||   his fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good
U||   grace. I looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him
U||   where they were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all
U||   flown away. There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow
U||   a drop of blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report
U||   to me if there were anything odd about him during the day.
U||   11 a. m.—The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has
U||   been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. “My belief
U||   is, doctor,” he said, “that he has eaten his birds, and that he just
U||   took and ate them raw!”
U||   11 p. m.—I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make even
U||   him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought
U||   that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
U||   proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to
U||   invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous
U||   (life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he
U||   can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He
U||   gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
U||   wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later
U||   steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It
U||   might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at
U||   vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance
U||   science in its most difficult and vital aspect—the knowledge of the
U||   brain? Had I even the secret of one such mind—did I hold the key to the
U||   fancy of even one lunatic—I might advance my own branch of science to a
U||   pitch compared with which Burdon-Sanderson’s physiology or Ferrier’s
U||   brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient
U||   cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good
U||   cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an
U||   exceptional brain, congenitally?
U||   How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I
U||   wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has
U||   closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How
U||   many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?
U||   To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new
U||   hope, and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the
U||   Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance
U||   to profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can
U||   I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only
U||   wait on hopeless and work. Work! work!
U||   If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there—a
U||   good, unselfish cause to make me work—that would be indeed happiness.
U||   Mina Murray’s Journal.
U||   26 July.—I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it is
U||   like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time. And there
U||   is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different
U||   from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I had not
U||   heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
U||   yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter
U||   from him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the
U||   enclosed had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle
U||   Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like
U||   Jonathan; I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too,
U||   Lucy, although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of
U||   walking in her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have
U||   decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs.
U||   Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of
U||   houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and
U||   fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor
U||   dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her
U||   husband, Lucy’s father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the
U||   night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to
U||   be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses
U||   and how her house is to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do
U||   the same, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way,
U||   and shall have to try to make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood—he is the
U||   Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming—is coming up here very
U||   shortly—as soon as he can leave town, for his father is not very well,
U||   and I think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes. She wants
U||   to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the
U||   beauty of Whitby. I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her; she
U||   will be all right when he arrives.
U||   27 July.—No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,
U||   though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write,
U||   if it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each
U||   night I am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the
U||   weather is so hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and
U||   the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am
U||   getting nervous and wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy’s health keeps up.
U||   Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who
U||   has been taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing
U||   him, but it does not touch her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her
U||   cheeks are a lovely rose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she
U||   had. I pray it will all last.
U||   3 August.—Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to Mr.
U||   Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely
U||   would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it
U||   does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is his
U||   writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in her
U||   sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her which
U||   I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching me. She
U||   tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room searching
U||   for the key.
U||   6 August.—Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting
U||   dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should
U||   feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last
U||   letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable
U||   than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and
U||   the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it
U||   and learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I
U||   write is hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is
U||   grey—except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey
U||   earthy rock; grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge,
U||   hang over the grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey
U||   fingers. The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats
U||   with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is
U||   lost in a grey mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like
U||   giant rocks, and there is a “brool” over the sea that sounds like some
U||   presage of doom. Dark figures are on the beach here and there,
U||   sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem “men like trees walking.”
U||   The fishing-boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground
U||   swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here
U||   comes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by
U||   the way he lifts his hat, that he wants to talk....
U||   I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he
U||   sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:—
U||   “I want to say something to you, miss.” I could see he was not at ease,
U||   so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
U||   fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:—
U||   “I’m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked
U||   things I’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
U||   but I didn’t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I’m gone.
U||   We aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal,
U||   don’t altogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart
U||   of it; an’ that’s why I’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that I’d
U||   cheer up my own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t afraid of
U||   dyin’, not a bit; only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My time
U||   must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much
U||   for any man to expect; and I’m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already
U||   whettin’ his scythe. Ye see, I can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’
U||   about it all at once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day
U||   soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don’t ye
U||   dooal an’ greet, my deary!”—for he saw that I was crying—“if he should
U||   come this very night I’d not refuse to answer his call. For life be,
U||   after all, only a waitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and
U||   death be all that we can rightly depend on. But I’m content, for it’s
U||   comin’ to me, my deary, and comin’ quick. It may be comin’ while we be
U||   lookin’ and wonderin’. Maybe it’s in that wind out over the sea that’s
U||   bringin’ with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts.
U||   Look! look!” he cried suddenly. “There’s something in that wind and in
U||   the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like
U||   death. It’s in the air; I feel it comin’. Lord, make me answer cheerful
U||   when my call comes!” He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat.
U||   His mouth moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes’
U||   silence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said
U||   good-bye, and hobbled off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.
U||   I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his
U||   arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time
U||   kept looking at a strange ship.
U||   “I can’t make her out,” he said; “she’s a Russian, by the look of her;
U||   but she’s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn’t know her mind
U||   a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can’t decide whether to
U||   run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is
U||   steered mighty strangely, for she doesn’t mind the hand on the wheel;
U||   changes about with every puff of wind. We’ll hear more of her before
U||   this time to-morrow.”
U||CHAPTER VII
U||CUTTING FROM “THE DAILYGRAPH,” 8 AUGUST
U||   (Pasted in Mina Murray’s Journal.)
U||   From a Correspondent.
U||   Whitby.
U||   ONE of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
U||   experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had
U||   been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
U||   August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
U||   body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
U||   Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips
U||   in the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers Emma and Scarborough made
U||   trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
U||   “tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
U||   afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff
U||   churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
U||   sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of
U||   “mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then
U||   blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
U||   language is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at
U||   once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a
U||   century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold
U||   in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of
U||   sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of
U||   splendidly-coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the
U||   walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before
U||   the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly
U||   athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds
U||   of every sunset-colour—flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the
U||   tints of gold; with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly
U||   absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as
U||   colossal silhouettes. The experience was not lost on the painters, and
U||   doubtless some of the sketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will
U||   grace the R. A. and R. I. walls in May next. More than one captain made
U||   up his mind then and there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they
U||   term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till
U||   the storm had passed. The wind fell away entirely during the evening,
U||   and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that
U||   prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons
U||   of a sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for
U||   even the coasting steamers, which usually “hug” the shore so closely,
U||   kept well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight. The only
U||   sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was
U||   seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her
U||   officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight,
U||   and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her
U||   danger. Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly
U||   flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,
U||   “As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”
U||   Shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite
U||   oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep
U||   inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and
U||   the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in
U||   the great harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came a
U||   strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
U||   carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.
U||   Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the
U||   time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
U||   the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in
U||   growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes
U||   the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.
U||   White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
U||   shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume
U||   swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of
U||   either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew
U||   with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept
U||   their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was
U||   found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers,
U||   or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold.
U||   To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog
U||   came drifting inland—white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly
U||   fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
U||   imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were
U||   touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
U||   a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist
U||   cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of
U||   the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden
U||   peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the
U||   shock of the footsteps of the storm.
U||   Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
U||   absorbing interest—the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
U||   each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
U||   snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat,
U||   with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and
U||   again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the
U||   East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not
U||   yet been tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order,
U||   and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of
U||   the sea. Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a
U||   fishing-boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able,
U||   by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing
U||   against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there
U||   was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for
U||   a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.
U||   Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
U||   with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
U||   earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,
U||   and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
U||   realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the
U||   port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
U||   to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
U||   it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
U||   harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
U||   great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
U||   visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
U||   speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,
U||   if it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater
U||   than any hitherto—a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all
U||   things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of
U||   hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and
U||   the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even
U||   louder than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the
U||   harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and
U||   men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and
U||   the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, mirabile
U||   dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at
U||   headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all
U||   sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight
U||   followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to
U||   the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and
U||   fro at each motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at
U||   all. A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a
U||   miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead
U||   man! However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these
U||   words. The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched
U||   herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides
U||   and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under
U||   the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.
U||   There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
U||   the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
U||   “top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very
U||   instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from
U||   below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped
U||   from the bow on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where
U||   the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that
U||   some of the flat tombstones—“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as
U||   they call them in the Whitby vernacular—actually project over where the
U||   sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which
U||   seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.
U||   It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier,
U||   as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or
U||   were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the
U||   eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier,
U||   was the first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after
U||   scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then
U||   turned the light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran
U||   aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and
U||   recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to
U||   pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It
U||   is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill
U||   Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well
U||   ahead of the crowd. When I arrived, however, I found already assembled
U||   on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to
U||   come on board. By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your
U||   correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group
U||   who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.
U||   It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
U||   not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened
U||   by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between
U||   the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which
U||   it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast
U||   by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time,
U||   but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the
U||   rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with
U||   which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made
U||   of the state of things, and a doctor—Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East
U||   Elliot Place—who came immediately after me, declared, after making
U||   examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In
U||   his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll
U||   of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard
U||   said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with
U||   his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save
U||   some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards
U||   cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian
U||   entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are
U||   wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights
U||   of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held
U||   in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as
U||   emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead
U||   hand. It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently
U||   removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till
U||   death—a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca—and
U||   placed in the mortuary to await inquest.
U||   Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
U||   crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
U||   the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further
U||   details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
U||   harbour in the storm.
U||   Whitby
U||   9 August.—The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
U||   storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It
U||   turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the
U||   Demeter. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
U||   small amount of cargo—a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
U||   This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington,
U||   of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
U||   possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,
U||   acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and
U||   paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except
U||   the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been
U||   most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
U||   existing regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,”
U||   they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after
U||   complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
U||   landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the
U||   S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the
U||   animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
U||   it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it
U||   was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
U||   hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a
U||   possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it
U||   is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a
U||   half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier,
U||   was found dead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had
U||   been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat
U||   was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.
U||   Later.—By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been
U||   permitted to look over the log-book of the Demeter, which was in order
U||   up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
U||   except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is
U||   with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced
U||   at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them
U||   unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for
U||   concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
U||   rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
U||   supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
U||   some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that
U||   this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my
U||   statement must be taken cum grano, since I am writing from the
U||   dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for
U||   me, time being short.
U||   LOG OF THE “DEMETER.”
U||   Varna to Whitby.
U||   Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep
U||   accurate note henceforth till we land.
U||   On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.
U||   At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates,
U||   cook, and myself (captain).
U||   On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs
U||   officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.
U||   On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of
U||   guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but
U||   quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.
U||   On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something.
U||   Seemed scared, but would not speak out.
U||   On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who
U||   sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they
U||   only told him there was something, and crossed themselves. Mate lost
U||   temper with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce
U||   quarrel, but all was quiet.
U||   On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky,
U||   was missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells
U||   last night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more
U||   downcast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but
U||   would not say more than there was something aboard. Mate getting very
U||   impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.
U||   On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and
U||   in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange
U||   man aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering
U||   behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,
U||   thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,
U||   and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,
U||   but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all
U||   closed. He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the
U||   panic may spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship
U||   carefully from stem to stern.
U||   Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
U||   evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
U||   stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to
U||   such foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to
U||   keep them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm,
U||   while the rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with
U||   lanterns: we left no corner unsearched. As there were only the big
U||   wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men
U||   much relieved when search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First
U||   mate scowled, but said nothing.
U||   22 July.—Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
U||   sails—no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.
U||   Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad
U||   weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.
U||   24 July.—There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,
U||   and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
U||   night another man lost—disappeared. Like the first, he came off his
U||   watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round
U||   robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate
U||   angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do
U||   some violence.
U||   28 July.—Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom, and
U||   the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly know
U||   how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate volunteered
U||   to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours’ sleep. Wind
U||   abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is steadier.
U||   29 July.—Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too tired
U||   to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one except
U||   steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search, but no
U||   one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate and I
U||   agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.
U||   30 July.—Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine, all
U||   sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling me
U||   that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and
U||   two hands left to work ship.
U||   1 August.—Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in
U||   the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
U||   Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not
U||   lower, as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some
U||   terrible doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His
U||   stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are
U||   beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to
U||   worst. They are Russian, he Roumanian.
U||   2 August, midnight.—Woke up from few minutes’ sleep by hearing a cry,
U||   seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck,
U||   and ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on
U||   watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits
U||   of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as
U||   he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and
U||   only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God
U||   seems to have deserted us.
U||   3 August.—At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when
U||   I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran
U||   before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the
U||   mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He
U||   looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given
U||   way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
U||   ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “It is here; I know it,
U||   now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and
U||   ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind It,
U||   and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air.”
U||   And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space.
U||   Then he went on: “But It is here, and I’ll find It. It is in the hold,
U||   perhaps in one of those boxes. I’ll unscrew them one by one and see.
U||   You work the helm.” And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip,
U||   he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not
U||   leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and
U||   a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving
U||   mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt those big
U||   boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as
U||   harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and
U||   write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog
U||   clears. Then, if I can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I
U||   shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help....
U||   It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the
U||   mate would come out calmer—for I heard him knocking away at something
U||   in the hold, and work is good for him—there came up the hatchway a
U||   sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the
U||   deck he came as if shot from a gun—a raging madman, with his eyes
U||   rolling and his face convulsed with fear. “Save me! save me!” he cried,
U||   and then looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to
U||   despair, and in a steady voice he said: “You had better come too,
U||   captain, before it is too late. He is there. I know the secret now. The
U||   sea will save me from Him, and it is all that is left!” Before I could
U||   say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and
U||   deliberately threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret
U||   too, now. It was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and
U||   now he has followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for
U||   all these horrors when I get to port? When I get to port! Will that
U||   ever be?
U||   4 August.—Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is
U||   sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go
U||   below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in
U||   the dimness of the night I saw It—Him! God forgive me, but the mate was
U||   right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a
U||   sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must
U||   not leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I
U||   shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and
U||   along with them I shall tie that which He—It!—dare not touch; and then,
U||   come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a
U||   captain. I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can
U||   look me in the face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are
U||   wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found, and those who find it may
U||   understand; if not, ... well, then all men shall know that I have been
U||   true to my trust. God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor
U||   ignorant soul trying to do his duty....
U||   Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;
U||   and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
U||   none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
U||   simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is
U||   arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk
U||   for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey
U||   steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The
U||   owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names
U||   as wishing to follow him to the grave.
U||   No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
U||   mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I
U||   believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so
U||   will end this one more “mystery of the sea.”
U||   Mina Murray’s Journal.
U||   8 August.—Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not
U||   sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
U||   chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to
U||   be like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got
U||   up twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time
U||   and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed.
U||   It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will
U||   is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
U||   disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
U||   life.
U||   Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
U||   if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people
U||   about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the
U||   big, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam
U||   that topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow
U||   mouth of the harbour—like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow
U||   I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land.
U||   But, oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting
U||   fearfully anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do
U||   anything!
U||   10 August.—The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
U||   touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
U||   was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the
U||   churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat,
U||   whilst the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came
U||   down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the
U||   way. The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we
U||   stood on it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed
U||   much upset. She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but
U||   think that her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in
U||   one thing: she will not admit to me that there is any cause for
U||   restlessness; or if there be, she does not understand it herself. There
U||   is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this
U||   morning on our seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the
U||   doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there
U||   was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them
U||   shudder. Poor dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying
U||   eyes! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more
U||   acutely than other people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little
U||   thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of
U||   animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats
U||   was followed by his dog. The dog is always with him. They are both
U||   quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark.
U||   During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the
U||   seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling. Its master
U||   spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would
U||   neither come nor cease to make a noise. It was in a sort of fury, with
U||   its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat’s tail when
U||   puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped
U||   down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and
U||   half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is
U||   fixed. The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and
U||   fell all into a tremble. It did not try to get away, but crouched down,
U||   quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that
U||   I tried, though without effect, to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity,
U||   too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an
U||   agonised sort of way. I greatly fear that she is of too super-sensitive
U||   a nature to go through the world without trouble. She will be dreaming
U||   of this to-night, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of things—the ship
U||   steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a
U||   crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now
U||   in terror—will all afford material for her dreams.
U||   I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I
U||   shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and
U||   back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.
U||CHAPTER VIII
U||MINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL
U||   Same day, 11 o’clock p. m.—Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I
U||   had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely
U||   walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some
U||   dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the
U||   lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot
U||   everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the
U||   slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at
U||   Robin Hood’s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window
U||   right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should
U||   have shocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant,
U||   bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to
U||   rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy
U||   was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we
U||   could. The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him
U||   to stay for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty
U||   miller; I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I
U||   think that some day the bishops must get together and see about
U||   breeding up a new class of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter
U||   how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired.
U||   Lucy is asleep and breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks
U||   than usual, and looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with
U||   her seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if
U||   he saw her now. Some of the “New Women” writers will some day start an
U||   idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep
U||   before proposing or accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t
U||   condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself. And
U||   a nice job she will make of it, too! There’s some consolation in that.
U||   I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better. I really
U||   believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles
U||   with dreaming. I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan....
U||   God bless and keep him.
U||   11 August, 3 a. m.—Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write. I
U||   am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an
U||   agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my
U||   diary.... Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible
U||   sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The
U||   room was dark, so I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt
U||   for her. The bed was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in
U||   the room. The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared
U||   to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw
U||   on some clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the
U||   room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to
U||   her dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
U||   Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I said
U||   to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran
U||   downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in
U||   all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear
U||   chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open.
U||   It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The
U||   people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I
U||   feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to
U||   think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all
U||   details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking
U||   one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran
U||   along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure
U||   which I expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked
U||   across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear—I don’t know
U||   which—of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat. There was a bright full
U||   moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene
U||   into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across. For a
U||   moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured
U||   St. Mary’s Church and all around it. Then as the cloud passed I could
U||   see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a
U||   narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church
U||   and the churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever my expectation
U||   was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the
U||   silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white.
U||   The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow
U||   shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though
U||   something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and
U||   bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell; I
U||   did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to
U||   the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only
U||   way to reach the East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul
U||   did I see; I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor
U||   Lucy’s condition. The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees
U||   trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps
U||   to the abbey. I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my
U||   feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were
U||   rusty. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white
U||   figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the
U||   spells of shadow. There was undoubtedly something, long and black,
U||   bending over the half-reclining white figure. I called in fright,
U||   “Lucy! Lucy!” and something raised a head, and from where I was I could
U||   see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran
U||   on to the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was
U||   between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her.
U||   When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight
U||   struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her
U||   head lying over the back of the seat. She was quite alone, and there
U||   was not a sign of any living thing about.
U||   When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips
U||   were parted, and she was breathing—not softly as usual with her, but in
U||   long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
U||   breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled
U||   the collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so
U||   there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I
U||   flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
U||   for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
U||   unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
U||   have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her
U||   throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety
U||   and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
U||   became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I
U||   had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began
U||   very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually
U||   she became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
U||   occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
U||   reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,
U||   till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised
U||   to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she
U||   was. Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body
U||   must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at
U||   waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She
U||   trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once
U||   with me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As
U||   we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince.
U||   She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would
U||   not. However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where
U||   there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet
U||   with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went
U||   home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare
U||   feet.
U||   Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we
U||   saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front
U||   of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such
U||   as there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them
U||   in Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I
U||   thought I should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only
U||   for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her
U||   reputation in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had
U||   washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I
U||   tucked her into bed. Before falling asleep she asked—even implored—me
U||   not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking
U||   adventure. I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the
U||   state of her mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing
U||   would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become
U||   distorted—nay, infallibly would—in case it should leak out, I thought
U||   it wiser to do so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the
U||   key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed.
U||   Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over
U||   the sea....
U||   Same day, noon.—All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed
U||   not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not
U||   seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
U||   looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to
U||   notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it
U||   might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must
U||   have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there
U||   are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her
U||   nightdress was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned
U||   about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it.
U||   Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.
U||   Same day, night.—We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the sun
U||   bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave
U||   Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the
U||   cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for
U||   I could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had
U||   Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the
U||   evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by
U||   Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful
U||   than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock
U||   the door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect
U||   any trouble to-night.
U||   12 August.—My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was
U||   wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to be
U||   a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under
U||   a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping
U||   outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see, was even
U||   better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of manner
U||   seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and
U||   told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan,
U||   and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for,
U||   though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to make them more
U||   bearable.
U||   13 August.—Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
U||   before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,
U||   still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling
U||   aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
U||   effect of the light over the sea and sky—merged together in one great,
U||   silent mystery—was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight
U||   flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once
U||   or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing
U||   me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came
U||   back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping
U||   peacefully. She did not stir again all night.
U||   14 August.—On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems
U||   to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to
U||   get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
U||   dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for
U||   dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and
U||   stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low
U||   down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was
U||   thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
U||   everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and
U||   suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:—
U||   “His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an odd
U||   expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me. I
U||   slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
U||   at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look
U||   on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but
U||   followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
U||   whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,
U||   for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
U||   burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red
U||   sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our
U||   seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
U||   refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I
U||   called Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
U||   with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that
U||   she was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it;
U||   so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and
U||   went early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll
U||   myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of
U||   sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home—it was
U||   then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of
U||   the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen—I threw a
U||   glance up at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought
U||   that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief
U||   and waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just
U||   then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light
U||   fell on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up
U||   against the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast
U||   asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that
U||   looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I
U||   ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her
U||   bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to
U||   her throat, as though to protect it from cold.
U||   I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that
U||   the door is locked and the window securely fastened.
U||   She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont,
U||   and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like.
U||   I fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it
U||   is.
U||   15 August.—Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and slept
U||   on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
U||   Arthur’s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon.
U||   Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once.
U||   Later on in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy
U||   as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one
U||   to protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has
U||   got her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise
U||   secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she
U||   must die, for her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden
U||   shock would be almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from
U||   her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy’s sleep-walking.
U||   17 August.—No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to
U||   write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
U||   No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
U||   mother’s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy’s
U||   fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
U||   the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
U||   she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her
U||   gasping as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my
U||   wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at
U||   the open window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and
U||   when I tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I
U||   managed to restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently
U||   between long, painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she
U||   came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away. I trust
U||   her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I
U||   looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds
U||   seem not to have healed. They are still open, and, if anything, larger
U||   than before, and the edges of them are faintly white. They are like
U||   little white dots with red centres. Unless they heal within a day or
U||   two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.

U||   Mina Murray’s Journal.
U||   18 August.—I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the
U||   churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all
U||   night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already
U||   to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she
U||   were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in
U||   gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence
U||   seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I
U||   needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here, on this very
U||   seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the
U||   heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:—
U||   “My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! I daresay poor old
U||   Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn’t want to wake
U||   up Geordie.” As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if
U||   she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet,
U||   puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur—I call him Arthur
U||   from her habit—says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t wonder that he does.
U||   Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall
U||   it to herself:—
U||   “I didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to
U||   be here in this spot—I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something—I
U||   don’t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing
U||   through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by,
U||   and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling—the
U||   whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once—as
U||   I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and
U||   dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
U||   sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking
U||   into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have
U||   heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
U||   from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
U||   I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,
U||   and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an
U||   earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do
U||   it before I felt you.”
U||   Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I
U||   listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it
U||   better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
U||   subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the
U||   fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
U||   rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very
U||   happy evening together.
U||   19 August.—Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of
U||   Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I
U||   am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent
U||   me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in
U||   the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if
U||   necessary, and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a
U||   bad thing if we were to be married out there. I have cried over the
U||   good Sister’s letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it
U||   lies. It is of Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is in my
U||   heart. My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only
U||   taking one change of dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep
U||   it till I send for it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I
U||   must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has
U||   seen and touched must comfort me till we meet.
U||   Letter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary,
U||   Buda-Pesth, to Miss Wilhelmina Murray.
U||   “12 August.
U||   “Dear Madam,—
U||   “I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong
U||   enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Joseph
U||   and Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks,
U||   suffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love,
U||   and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins,
U||   Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his
U||   delay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some few
U||   weeks’ rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He
U||   wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he
U||   would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall
U||   not be wanting for help.
U||   “Believe me,
U||   “Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,
U||   “Sister Agatha.
U||   “P. S.—My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something
U||   more. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his
U||   wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock—so says
U||   our doctor—and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of
U||   wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of
U||   what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite
U||   him of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness
U||   as his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we
U||   knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
U||   could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
U||   was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station
U||   shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that
U||   he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the
U||   way thither that the train reached.
U||   “Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his
U||   sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no
U||   doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for
U||   safety’s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary,
U||   many, many, happy years for you both.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   19 August.—Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About
U||   eight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does
U||   when setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my
U||   interest in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to
U||   the attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he
U||   was quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he
U||   would say was:—
U||   “I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at
U||   hand.”
U||   The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which
U||   has seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man
U||   with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The
U||   combination is a dreadful one. At nine o’clock I visited him myself.
U||   His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his
U||   sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed
U||   to him as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon
U||   think that he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between
U||   man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen
U||   give themselves away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but
U||   the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle
U||   and a sparrow. Oh, if men only knew!
U||   For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and
U||   greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict
U||   observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his
U||   eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it
U||   the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come
U||   to know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of
U||   his bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I
U||   thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and
U||   tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed
U||   to excite his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said
U||   testily:—
U||   “Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.”
U||   “What?” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care about
U||   spiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is
U||   filling up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered
U||   enigmatically:—
U||   “The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
U||   but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
U||   that are filled.”
U||   He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his
U||   bed all the time I remained with him.
U||   I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and
U||   how different things might have been. If I don’t sleep at once,
U||   chloral, the modern Morpheus—C[2]HCl[3]O. H[2]O! I must be careful not
U||   to let it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have
U||   thought of Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If
U||   need be, to-night shall be sleepless....
U||   Later.—Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had
U||   lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
U||   night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield
U||   had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
U||   too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might
U||   work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.
U||   He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
U||   bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His
U||   attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He
U||   ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
U||   sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
U||   The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should
U||   go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out
U||   of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get
U||   through the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet
U||   foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt.
U||   The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
U||   straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the
U||   belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates
U||   our grounds from those of the deserted house.
U||   I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
U||   immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our
U||   friend might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the
U||   wall, dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’s figure
U||   just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On
U||   the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old
U||   ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some
U||   one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying,
U||   lest I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant
U||   swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of
U||   escaping is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he
U||   did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw
U||   nearer to him—the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were
U||   closing him in. I heard him say:—
U||   “I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will
U||   reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar
U||   off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not
U||   pass me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good
U||   things?”
U||   He is a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes
U||   even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a
U||   startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.
U||   He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I
U||   never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I
U||   shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and
U||   his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he
U||   might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any
U||   rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat
U||   that keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded
U||   room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
U||   more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.
U||   Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:—
U||   “I shall be patient, Master. It is coming—coming—coming!”
U||   So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this
U||   diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.
U||CHAPTER IX
U||   Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.
U||   “Buda-Pesth, 24 August.
U||   “My dearest Lucy,—
U||   “I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
U||   parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull
U||   all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here.
U||   I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I
U||   knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some
U||   nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear
U||   one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone
U||   out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in
U||   his face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not
U||   remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At
U||   least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had
U||   some terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were
U||   to try to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born
U||   nurse, tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his
U||   head. I wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross
U||   herself, and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick
U||   were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation
U||   should hear them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good
U||   soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the
U||   subject again, and after saying that she could never mention what my
U||   poor dear raved about, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that
U||   it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as
U||   his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you
U||   or what he owes to you. His fear was of great and terrible things,
U||   which no mortal can treat of.’ I do believe the dear soul thought I
U||   might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any
U||   other girl. The idea of my being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my
U||   dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I knew
U||   that no other woman was a cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his
U||   bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps. He is waking!...
U||   “When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something
U||   from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
U||   I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to
U||   let me look at it—for I knew then that I might find some clue to his
U||   trouble—but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent
U||   me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.
U||   Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the
U||   note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:—
U||   “‘Wilhelmina’—I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has
U||   never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him—‘you know,
U||   dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be
U||   no secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to
U||   think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it
U||   was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain
U||   fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to
U||   know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ For, my
U||   dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
U||   complete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is
U||   the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
U||   know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back
U||   to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ He
U||   fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed
U||   him. I have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding
U||   be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply....
U||   “She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission
U||   church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon
U||   after as Jonathan awakes....
U||   “Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very
U||   happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
U||   sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I will’ firmly
U||   and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even
U||   those words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please
U||   God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet
U||   responsibilities I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding
U||   present. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my
U||   husband—oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words ‘my
U||   husband’—left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his
U||   pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit
U||   of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the
U||   knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I
U||   kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep
U||   it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our
U||   lives that we trusted each other; that I would never open it unless it
U||   were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he
U||   took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took his
U||   wife’s hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide
U||   world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if
U||   need be. The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he
U||   cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes
U||   up not only the month, but the year.
U||   “Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the
U||   happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give
U||   him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my
U||   love and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed
U||   me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very
U||   solemn pledge between us....
U||   “Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because
U||   it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
U||   me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
U||   the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,
U||   and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so
U||   that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My
U||   dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day
U||   of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I
U||   must not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you
U||   will be always as happy as I am now. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post
U||   this at once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for
U||   Jonathan is waking—I must attend to my husband!
U||   “Your ever-loving
U||   “Mina Harker.”
U||   Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker.
U||   “Whitby, 30 August.
U||   “My dearest Mina,—
U||   “Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own
U||   home with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to
U||   stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has
U||   quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of
U||   life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given
U||   up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a
U||   week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am
U||   getting fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We
U||   have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and
U||   fishing together; and I love him more than ever. He tells me that he
U||   loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he
U||   couldn’t love me more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he
U||   is, calling to me. So no more just at present from your loving
U||   “Lucy.
U||   “P. S.—Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.
U||   “P. P. S.—We are to be married on 28 September.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   20 August.—The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has now
U||   so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion. For
U||   the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one
U||   night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
U||   himself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.” The attendant came to tell
U||   me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the
U||   strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
U||   from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading—I might
U||   almost say, “cringing”—softness. I was satisfied with his present
U||   condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,
U||   but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange
U||   thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
U||   coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
U||   furtively at them:—
U||   “They think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The fools!”
U||   It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
U||   even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same
U||   I do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in
U||   common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
U||   he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is
U||   needful to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak.
U||   Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him.
U||   He will only say: “I don’t take any stock in cats. I have more to think
U||   of now, and I can wait; I can wait.”
U||   After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet
U||   until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at
U||   length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted
U||   him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.
U||   ... Three nights has the same thing happened—violent all day then quiet
U||   from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It
U||   would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
U||   Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He
U||   escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We
U||   shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they
U||   are required....
U||   23 August.—“The unexpected always happens.” How well Disraeli knew
U||   life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our
U||   subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one
U||   thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in
U||   future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given
U||   orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
U||   when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul’s
U||   body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!
U||   The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.
U||   Later.—Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
U||   attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him
U||   and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.
U||   Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
U||   in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me
U||   he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
U||   would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing
U||   happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
U||   calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I
U||   caught the patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it
U||   looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its
U||   silent and ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about,
U||   but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound
U||   for or had some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every
U||   instant, and presently said:—
U||   “You needn’t tie me; I shall go quietly!” Without trouble we came back
U||   to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
U||   not forget this night....
U||   Lucy Westenra’s Diary
U||   Hillingham, 24 August.—I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things
U||   down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it
U||   will be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last
U||   night I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it
U||   is the change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid
U||   to me, for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I
U||   feel so weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite
U||   grieved when he saw me, and I hadn’t the spirit to try to be cheerful.
U||   I wonder if I could sleep in mother’s room to-night. I shall make an
U||   excuse and try.
U||   25 August.—Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my
U||   proposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to
U||   worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when
U||   the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been
U||   falling asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the
U||   window, but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I
U||   must then have fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember
U||   them. This morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my
U||   throat pains me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don’t
U||   seem ever to get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes,
U||   or else I know he will be miserable to see me so.
U||   Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward.
U||   “Albemarle Hotel, 31 August.
U||   “My dear Jack,—
U||   “I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special
U||   disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have
U||   asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for
U||   to disturb the poor lady’s mind about her daughter in her present state
U||   of health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her
U||   doom is spoken—disease of the heart—though poor Lucy does not know it
U||   yet. I am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl’s mind.
U||   I am almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a
U||   pang. I told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred
U||   at first—I know why, old fellow—she finally consented. It will be a
U||   painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for her sake, and I
U||   must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at
U||   Hillingham to-morrow, two o’clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
U||   Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being
U||   alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I
U||   am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I
U||   can after you have seen her. Do not fail!
U||   “Arthur.”
U||   Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward.
U||   “1 September.
U||   “Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully
U||   by to-night’s post to Ring. Wire me if necessary.”
U||   Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood.
U||   “2 September.
U||   “My dear old fellow,—
U||   “With regard to Miss Westenra’s health I hasten to let you know at once
U||   that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any
U||   malady that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means
U||   satisfied with her appearance; she is woefully different from what she
U||   was when I saw her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not
U||   have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very
U||   friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or
U||   custom can bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened,
U||   leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then
U||   say what I have done and propose doing.
U||   “I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was
U||   present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all
U||   she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I
U||   have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution
U||   there is. We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be
U||   cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real
U||   cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy
U||   was left with me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her
U||   gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the
U||   door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank
U||   down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand.
U||   When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage
U||   of her reaction to make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:—
U||   “‘I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.’ I reminded her
U||   that a doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
U||   anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled
U||   that matter in a word. ‘Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not
U||   care for myself, but all for him!’ So I am quite free.
U||   “I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see
U||   the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the
U||   quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord
U||   gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a
U||   slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I
U||   secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The
U||   qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I
U||   should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical
U||   matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as
U||   there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it
U||   must be something mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing
U||   satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams
U||   that frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing. She
U||   says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in
U||   Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night
U||   and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me
U||   that of late the habit has not returned. I am in doubt, and so have
U||   done the best thing I know of; I have written to my old friend and
U||   master, Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about
U||   obscure diseases as any one in the world. I have asked him to come
U||   over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge, I
U||   have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra.
U||   This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too
U||   proud and happy to do anything I can for her. Van Helsing would, I
U||   know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so, no matter on what
U||   ground he comes, we must accept his wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary
U||   man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than
U||   any one else. He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the
U||   most advanced scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an
U||   absolutely open mind. This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the
U||   ice-brook, an indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration
U||   exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart
U||   that beats—these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing
U||   for mankind—work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide
U||   as his all-embracing sympathy. I tell you these facts that you may know
U||   why I have such confidence in him. I have asked him to come at once. I
U||   shall see Miss Westenra to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the
U||   Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of
U||   my call.
U||   “Yours always,
U||   “John Seward.”
U||   Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr.
U||   Seward.
U||   “2 September.
U||   “My good Friend,—
U||   “When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good
U||   fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who
U||   have trusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who
U||   have trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he
U||   holds dear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound
U||   so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other
U||   friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my
U||   aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But it
U||   is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.
U||   Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be
U||   near to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady
U||   not too late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return
U||   here that night. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and
U||   stay longer if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.
U||   “Van Helsing.”
U||   Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.
U||   “3 September.
U||   “My dear Art,—
U||   “Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and
U||   found that, by Lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
U||   we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of
U||   the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of
U||   course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,
U||   but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you
U||   trust to me in the matter, he said: ‘You must tell him all you think.
U||   Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not
U||   jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ I asked
U||   what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had
U||   come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on
U||   his return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You
U||   must not be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that
U||   all his brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough
U||   when the time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an
U||   account of our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special
U||   article for The Daily Telegraph. He seemed not to notice, but remarked
U||   that the smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when
U||   he was a student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can
U||   possibly make it. In any case I am to have a letter.
U||   “Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first
U||   saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the
U||   ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was
U||   very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
U||   feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard
U||   struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
U||   look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of
U||   all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
U||   geniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation merge into
U||   reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation
U||   gently round to his visit, and suavely said:—
U||   “‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so
U||   much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do
U||   not see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of
U||   a ghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at
U||   me and went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How
U||   can he’—and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that
U||   with which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a
U||   particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of—‘know anything
U||   of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them
U||   back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
U||   oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But
U||   the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not
U||   tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known
U||   so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him
U||   away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little
U||   talk all to ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and
U||   presently the professor came to the window and called me in. He looked
U||   grave, but said: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no
U||   functional cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost;
U||   it has been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way
U||   anæmic. I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one
U||   or two question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well
U||   what she will say. And yet there is cause; there is always cause for
U||   everything. I must go back home and think. You must send to me the
U||   telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again. The
U||   disease—for not to be all well is a disease—interest me, and the sweet
U||   young dear, she interest me too. She charm me, and for her, if not for
U||   you or disease, I come.’
U||   “As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
U||   And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust
U||   your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my
U||   dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who
U||   are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
U||   you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to
U||   come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
U||   me.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   4 September.—Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him. He
U||   had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just
U||   before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
U||   the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a
U||   run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
U||   violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five
U||   minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
U||   into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now.
U||   The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were
U||   really appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to
U||   some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can
U||   quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I
U||   was some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum,
U||   and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,
U||   woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to
U||   show something directly. I cannot quite understand it.
U||   Later.—Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in on
U||   him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be.
U||   He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his
U||   capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges
U||   of padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad
U||   conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to
U||   his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to
U||   humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the
U||   sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
U||   harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a
U||   box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to
U||   find a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for
U||   any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would
U||   not rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of
U||   far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:—
U||   “All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do
U||   it for myself!” Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:
U||   “Doctor, won’t you be very good to me and let me have a little more
U||   sugar? I think it would be good for me.”
U||   “And the flies?” I said.
U||   “Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like
U||   it.” And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
U||   not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man
U||   as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.
U||   Midnight.—Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom
U||   I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own
U||   gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As his
U||   room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the
U||   morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty
U||   of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all
U||   the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water,
U||   and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building,
U||   with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to
U||   endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
U||   his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less
U||   frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him,
U||   an inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what
U||   intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes
U||   he stood up quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the
U||   attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do.
U||   He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of
U||   sugar; then he took his fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away
U||   the box; then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his
U||   bed. All this surprised me, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep
U||   flies any more?”
U||   “No,” said he; “I am sick of all that rubbish!” He certainly is a
U||   wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his
U||   mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue
U||   after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon
U||   and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at
U||   periods which affects certain natures—as at times the moon does others?
U||   We shall see.

U||   Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.
U||   “6 September.
U||   “My dear Art,—
U||   “My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.
U||   There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.
U||   Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me
U||   professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told
U||   her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming
U||   to stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with
U||   myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
U||   shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy’s weak
U||   condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with
U||   difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall
U||   come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you
U||   do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for
U||   news. In haste
U||   Yours ever,
U||   “John Seward.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   7 September.—The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at
U||   Liverpool Street was:—
U||   “Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”
U||   “No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram.
U||   I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
U||   Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”
U||   “Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet;
U||   perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he
U||   shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal
U||   with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
U||   as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen,
U||   too—the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why
U||   you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep
U||   knowledge in its place, where it may rest—where it may gather its kind
U||   around it and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and
U||   here.” He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched
U||   himself the same way. “I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later
U||   I shall unfold to you.”
U||   “Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at some
U||   decision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:—
U||   “My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has
U||   ripened—while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine
U||   has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull
U||   the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green
U||   chaff, and say to you: ‘Look! he’s good corn; he will make good crop
U||   when the time comes.’” I did not see the application, and told him so.
U||   For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it
U||   playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good
U||   husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But
U||   you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if
U||   he grow; that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for
U||   those who take it as of the work of their life. See you now, friend
U||   John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it
U||   sprout; if he sprout at all, there’s some promise; and I wait till the
U||   ear begins to swell.” He broke off, for he evidently saw that I
U||   understood. Then he went on, and very gravely:—
U||   “You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more
U||   full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and
U||   I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that
U||   knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
U||   Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this
U||   case of our dear miss is one that may be—mind, I say may be—of such
U||   interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
U||   beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too
U||   small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
U||   Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We
U||   learn from failure, not from success!”
U||   When I described Lucy’s symptoms—the same as before, but infinitely
U||   more marked—he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a
U||   bag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly
U||   paraphernalia of our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in one of
U||   his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When
U||   we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly
U||   so much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent
U||   moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own
U||   terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are
U||   so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal—even
U||   the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached—do not
U||   seem to reach her. It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers
U||   round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can
U||   protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact. If
U||   this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn
U||   any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its
U||   causes than we have knowledge of.
U||   I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
U||   a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness
U||   more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily
U||   that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and
U||   I were shown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her
U||   yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly,
U||   chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums,
U||   and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was
U||   painful to see or hear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his
U||   eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay
U||   motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while
U||   we were all silent. Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently
U||   out of the room. The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly
U||   along the passage to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me
U||   quickly in with him and closed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is
U||   dreadful. There is no time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of
U||   blood to keep the heart’s action as it should be. There must be
U||   transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?”
U||   “I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.”
U||   “Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”
U||   I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at
U||   the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
U||   door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in
U||   an eager whisper:—
U||   “Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and
U||   have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see
U||   for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to
U||   you, sir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him
U||   he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he
U||   took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young
U||   manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a
U||   pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand:—
U||   “Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is
U||   bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For he
U||   suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are to
U||   help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
U||   best help.”
U||   “What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me, and I shall do it. My
U||   life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for
U||   her.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old
U||   knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:—
U||   “My young sir, I do not ask so much as that—not the last!”
U||   “What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
U||   quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “Come!”
U||   he said. “You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than
U||   me, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked bewildered, and the
U||   Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:—
U||   “Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have
U||   or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to
U||   perform what we call transfusion of blood—to transfer from full veins
U||   of one to the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his
U||   blood, as he is the more young and strong than me”—here Arthur took my
U||   hand and wrung it hard in silence—“but, now you are here, you are more
U||   good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our
U||   nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” Arthur
U||   turned to him and said:—
U||   “If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would
U||   understand——”
U||   He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.
U||   “Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-off you will be happy
U||   that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You
U||   shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
U||   must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with
U||   her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”
U||   We all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.
U||   Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not
U||   asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke
U||   to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid
U||   them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and
U||   coming over to the bed, said cheerily:—
U||   “Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good
U||   child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made
U||   the effort with success.
U||   It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked
U||   the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began
U||   to flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to
U||   manifest its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the
U||   Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him
U||   strip off his coat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss
U||   whiles I bring over the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of
U||   us looked whilst he bent over her.
U||   Van Helsing turning to me, said:
U||   “He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
U||   defibrinate it.”
U||   Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed
U||   the operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to
U||   come back to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor
U||   the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to
U||   grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man
U||   as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system
U||   must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored
U||   her. But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and
U||   with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear
U||   my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an
U||   instant. It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all
U||   was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound
U||   and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without
U||   turning round—the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:—
U||   “The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have
U||   presently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the
U||   pillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band
U||   which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
U||   diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,
U||   and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I
U||   could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van
U||   Helsing’s ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but
U||   turned to me, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of
U||   the port wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and
U||   rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has
U||   so given to his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take
U||   it, sir, that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in
U||   all ways the operation is successful. You have saved her life this
U||   time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be
U||   is. I shall tell her all when she is well; she shall love you none the
U||   less for what you have done. Good-bye.”
U||   When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,
U||   but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her
U||   breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
U||   The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a
U||   whisper:—
U||   “What do you make of that mark on her throat?”
U||   “What do you make of it?”
U||   “I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded
U||   to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two
U||   punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of
U||   disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some
U||   trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it
U||   was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned
U||   the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole
U||   bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl
U||   must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the
U||   transfusion.
U||   “Well?” said Van Helsing.
U||   “Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “I
U||   must go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said. “There are books and
U||   things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you
U||   must not let your sight pass from her.”
U||   “Shall I have a nurse?” I asked.
U||   “We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that
U||   she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all
U||   the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as
U||   possible. And then we may begin.”
U||   “May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?”
U||   “We shall see!” he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment
U||   later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger
U||   held up:—
U||   “Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you
U||   shall not sleep easy hereafter!”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary—continued.
U||   8 September.—I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself off
U||   towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being
U||   from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were
U||   good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences
U||   of the absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs.
U||   Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with
U||   her she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s
U||   renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made
U||   preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the
U||   night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by
U||   the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
U||   gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed
U||   sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself
U||   together and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with
U||   greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was
U||   apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at
U||   once:—
U||   “You do not want to go to sleep?”
U||   “No; I am afraid.”
U||   “Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.”
U||   “Ah, not if you were like me—if sleep was to you a presage of horror!”
U||   “A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?”
U||   “I don’t know; oh, I don’t know. And that is what is so terrible. All
U||   this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”
U||   “But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and
U||   I can promise that nothing will happen.”
U||   “Ah, I can trust you!” I seized the opportunity, and said: “I promise
U||   you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.”
U||   “You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will
U||   sleep!” And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank
U||   back, asleep.
U||   All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on
U||   in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were
U||   slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
U||   pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad
U||   dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.
U||   In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took
U||   myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short
U||   wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result
U||   of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
U||   day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my
U||   zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for
U||   the past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam
U||   whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham
U||   to-night, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was
U||   leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.
U||   9 September.—I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham.
U||   For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was
U||   beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. Lucy
U||   was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands with me she looked
U||   sharply in my face and said:—
U||   “No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well
U||   again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who
U||   will sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had my
U||   supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I
U||   made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than
U||   excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next
U||   her own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now,” she said, “you must stay
U||   here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the
U||   sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
U||   bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I
U||   shall call out, and you can come to me at once.” I could not but
U||   acquiesce, for I was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had I
U||   tried. So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want
U||   anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.
U||   Lucy Westenra’s Diary.
U||   9 September.—I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,
U||   that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
U||   a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels
U||   very, very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I
U||   suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn
U||   our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength
U||   give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he
U||   wills. I know where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my
U||   dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the
U||   blissful rest of last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr.
U||   Seward watching me. And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is
U||   close at hand and within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me!
U||   Thank God! Good-night, Arthur.
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   10 September.—I was conscious of the Professor’s hand on my head, and
U||   started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn
U||   in an asylum, at any rate.
U||   “And how is our patient?”
U||   “Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,” I answered.
U||   “Come, let us see,” he said. And together we went into the room.
U||   The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van
U||   Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.
U||   As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I
U||   heard the Professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity,
U||   a deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back,
U||   and his exclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed no enforcement
U||   from his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and
U||   his iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to
U||   tremble.
U||   There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly
U||   white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums
U||   seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
U||   corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp
U||   in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
U||   stood to him, and he put it down again softly. “Quick!” he said. “Bring
U||   the brandy.” I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
U||   He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
U||   wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of
U||   agonising suspense said:—
U||   “It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is
U||   undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have
U||   to call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he was
U||   dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I
U||   had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no
U||   possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,
U||   without a moment’s delay, we began the operation. After a time—it did
U||   not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no
U||   matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling—Van Helsing
U||   held up a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that with
U||   growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
U||   danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection
U||   of morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
U||   intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
U||   subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride
U||   that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
U||   cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to
U||   feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he
U||   loves.
U||   The Professor watched me critically. “That will do,” he said.
U||   “Already?” I remonstrated. “You took a great deal more from Art.” To
U||   which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:—
U||   “He is her lover, her fiancé. You have work, much work, to do for her
U||   and for others; and the present will suffice.”
U||   When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied
U||   digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his
U||   leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by
U||   he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for
U||   myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half
U||   whispered:—
U||   “Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up
U||   unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him
U||   and enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!”
U||   When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:—
U||   “You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa,
U||   and rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”
U||   I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I
U||   had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I
U||   felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
U||   what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
U||   and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how
U||   she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to
U||   show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
U||   sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
U||   punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
U||   edges—tiny though they were.
U||   Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
U||   strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van
U||   Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge,
U||   with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I
U||   could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest
U||   telegraph office.
U||   Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
U||   had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her
U||   mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change
U||   whatever, but said to me gratefully:—
U||   “We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really
U||   must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale
U||   yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you
U||   do!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
U||   for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
U||   drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
U||   imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
U||   lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.
U||   Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:
U||   “Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong.
U||   I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You
U||   and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have
U||   grave reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to
U||   think even the most not-probable. Good-night.”
U||   In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
U||   them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and
U||   when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should
U||   sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign
U||   gentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
U||   I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account,
U||   that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen
U||   similar instances of woman’s kindness. I got back here in time for a
U||   late dinner; went my rounds—all well; and set this down whilst waiting
U||   for sleep. It is coming.
U||   11 September.—This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van
U||   Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had
U||   arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it
U||   with much impressment—assumed, of course—and showed a great bundle of
U||   white flowers.
U||   “These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said.
U||   “For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!”
U||   “Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.” Here
U||   Lucy made a wry face. “Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or
U||   in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I
U||   shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in
U||   seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty
U||   miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is
U||   medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make
U||   pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh
U||   yes! they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell
U||   so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the
U||   Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.”
U||   Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and
U||   smelling them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and
U||   half-disgust:—
U||   “Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,
U||   these flowers are only common garlic.”
U||   To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness,
U||   his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:—
U||   “No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;
U||   and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of
U||   others if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might
U||   well be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
U||   me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those
U||   so common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself
U||   the wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that
U||   make so inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of
U||   obedience; and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving
U||   arms that wait for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend
U||   John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all
U||   the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his
U||   glass-houses all the year. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would
U||   not have been here.”
U||   We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor’s
U||   actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopœia that
U||   I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them
U||   securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all
U||   over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might
U||   get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he
U||   rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side,
U||   and round the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me,
U||   and presently I said:—
U||   “Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but
U||   this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he
U||   would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”
U||   “Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath
U||   which Lucy was to wear round her neck.
U||   We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
U||   was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
U||   neck. The last words he said to her were:—
U||   “Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
U||   not to-night open the window or the door.”
U||   “I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for all
U||   your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such
U||   friends?”
U||   As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:—
U||   “To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want—two nights of travel,
U||   much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
U||   and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early
U||   you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
U||   more strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”
U||   He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights
U||   before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must
U||   have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend,
U||   but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.
U||CHAPTER XI
U||   Lucy Westenra’s Diary.
U||   12 September.—How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.
U||   Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He
U||   positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been
U||   right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread
U||   being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not
U||   mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I
U||   have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
U||   or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
U||   for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no
U||   dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings
U||   nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,
U||   and lying like Ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden
U||   strewments.” I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is
U||   delightful! There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already.
U||   Good-night, everybody.
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   13 September.—Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,
U||   up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The
U||   Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.
U||   Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at
U||   eight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
U||   fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s
U||   annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
U||   but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
U||   Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early
U||   riser. She greeted us warmly and said:—
U||   “You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still
U||   asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I
U||   should disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant.
U||   He rubbed his hands together, and said:—
U||   “Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,” to
U||   which she answered:—
U||   “You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state
U||   this morning is due in part to me.”
U||   “How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor.
U||   “Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
U||   her room. She was sleeping soundly—so soundly that even my coming did
U||   not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of
U||   those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had
U||   actually a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour
U||   would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them
U||   all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air.
U||   You will be pleased with her, I am sure.”
U||   She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As
U||   she had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen
U||   grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady
U||   was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would
U||   be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass
U||   into her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me,
U||   suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.
U||   Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He
U||   raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat
U||   his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,
U||   and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry
U||   sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he
U||   raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God!
U||   God! God!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done,
U||   that we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down
U||   from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?
U||   This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think,
U||   does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not
U||   tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh,
U||   how we are beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!”
U||   Suddenly he jumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and
U||   act. Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we
U||   fight him all the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and
U||   together we went up to Lucy’s room.
U||   Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the
U||   bed. This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the
U||   same awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and
U||   infinite pity.
U||   “As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his
U||   which meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and
U||   then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet
U||   another operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised
U||   the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a
U||   warning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall provide.
U||   You are weakened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled
U||   up his shirt-sleeve.
U||   Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
U||   the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time
U||   I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.
U||   Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must
U||   not remove anything from Lucy’s room without consulting him; that the
U||   flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
U||   was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the
U||   case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and
U||   would send me word when to come.
U||   After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
U||   seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.
U||   What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of
U||   life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.
U||   Lucy Westenra’s Diary.
U||   17 September.—Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong
U||   again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some
U||   long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
U||   feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim
U||   half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing;
U||   darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present
U||   distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the
U||   rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of
U||   water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad
U||   dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me
U||   out of my wits—the flapping against the windows, the distant voices
U||   which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not
U||   where and commanded me to do I know not what—have all ceased. I go to
U||   bed now without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I
U||   have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every
U||   day from Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to
U||   be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough
U||   to be left alone. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and
U||   for all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the
U||   change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the
U||   time. I found him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go
U||   to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost
U||   angrily against the window-panes.
U||   “The Pall Mall Gazette,” 18 September.
U||   THE ESCAPED WOLF.
U||   PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.
U||   Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens.
U||   After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
U||   the words “Pall Mall Gazette” as a sort of talisman, I managed to find
U||   the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf
U||   department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in
U||   the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to
U||   his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
U||   elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their
U||   hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
U||   comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called “business”
U||   until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the
U||   table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:—
U||   “Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You’ll excoose me
U||   refoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the
U||   wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea
U||   afore I begins to arsk them questions.”
U||   “How do you mean, ask them questions?” I queried, wishful to get him
U||   into a talkative humour.
U||   “’Ittin’ of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’ of
U||   their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a
U||   show-orf to their gals. I don’t so much mind the fust—the ’ittin’ with
U||   a pole afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they’ve ’ad
U||   their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the
U||   ear-scratchin’. Mind you,” he added philosophically, “there’s a deal of
U||   the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here’s you a-comin’
U||   and arskin’ of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like
U||   that only for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid I’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust
U||   ’fore I’d answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I’d
U||   like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions.
U||   Without offence did I tell yer to go to ’ell?”
U||   “You did.”
U||   “An’ when you said you’d report me for usin’ of obscene language that
U||   was ’ittin’ me over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. I
U||   weren’t a-goin’ to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my
U||   ’owl as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor’ love yer
U||   ’art, now that the old ’ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me,
U||   an’ rinsed me out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and I’ve lit hup, you
U||   may scratch my ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even a growl
U||   out of me. Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin’
U||   at, that ’ere escaped wolf.”
U||   “Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it
U||   happened; and when I know the facts I’ll get you to say what you
U||   consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
U||   end.”
U||   “All right, guv’nor. This ’ere is about the ’ole story. That ’ere wolf
U||   what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
U||   Norway to Jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a
U||   nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I’m more
U||   surprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in the
U||   place. But, there, you can’t trust wolves no more nor women.”
U||   “Don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh.
U||   “’E’s got mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if he ain’t like a
U||   old wolf ’isself! But there ain’t no ’arm in ’im.”
U||   “Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when I first
U||   hear my disturbance. I was makin’ up a litter in the monkey-house for a
U||   young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ I kem
U||   away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin’ like a mad thing at the
U||   bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn’t much people about that
U||   day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ’ook
U||   nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin’ through it. He
U||   had a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to
U||   him, for it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. He ’ad
U||   white kid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me
U||   and says: ‘Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’
U||   “‘Maybe it’s you,’ says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
U||   ’isself. He didn’t git angry, as I ’oped he would, but he smiled a kind
U||   of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no,
U||   they wouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.
U||   “‘Ow yes, they would,’ says I, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘They always likes a
U||   bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as a
U||   bagful.’
U||   “Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ they
U||   lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears
U||   same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn’t put
U||   in his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!
U||   “‘Tyke care,’ says I. ‘Bersicker is quick.’
U||   “‘Never mind,’ he says. ‘I’m used to ’em!’
U||   “‘Are you in the business yourself?’ I says, tyking off my ’at, for a
U||   man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.
U||   “‘No,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but I ’ave made pets of
U||   several.’ And with that he lifts his ’at as perlite as a lord, and
U||   walks away. Old Bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of
U||   sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn’t come hout
U||   the ’ole hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the
U||   wolves here all began a-’owling. There warn’t nothing for them to ’owl
U||   at. There warn’t no one near, except some one that was evidently
U||   a-callin’ a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road.
U||   Once or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and
U||   then the ’owling stopped. Just before twelve o’clock I just took a look
U||   round afore turnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old
U||   Bersicker’s cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage
U||   empty. And that’s all I know for certing.”
U||   “Did any one else see anything?”
U||   “One of our gard’ners was a-comin’ ’ome about that time from a ’armony,
U||   when he sees a big grey dog comin’ out through the garding ’edges. At
U||   least, so he says, but I don’t give much for it myself, for if he did
U||   ’e never said a word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome, and it
U||   was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been
U||   up all night-a-huntin’ of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered
U||   seein’ anything. My own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his
U||   ’ead.”
U||   “Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
U||   wolf?”
U||   “Well, sir,” he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, “I think I
U||   can; but I don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”
U||   “Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from
U||   experience, can’t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”
U||   “Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that ’ere
U||   wolf escaped—simply because he wanted to get out.”
U||   From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I
U||   could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
U||   explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn’t cope in badinage
U||   with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,
U||   so I said:—
U||   “Now, Mr. Bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
U||   and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told me
U||   what you think will happen.”
U||   “Right y’are, sir,” he said briskly. “Ye’ll excoose me, I know, for
U||   a-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as
U||   much as telling me to go on.”
U||   “Well, I never!” said the old lady.
U||   “My opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. The
U||   gard’ner wot didn’t remember said he was a-gallopin’ northward faster
U||   than a horse could go; but I don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,
U||   wolves don’t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built that
U||   way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets
U||   in packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they
U||   is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is.
U||   But, Lor’ bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not
U||   half so clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much
U||   fight in ’im. This one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’
U||   for hisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the Park a-’idin’ an’
U||   a-shiverin’ of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin’ where he is to get
U||   his breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in a
U||   coal-cellar. My eye, won’t some cook get a rum start when she sees his
U||   green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can’t get food he’s
U||   bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher’s
U||   shop in time. If he doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf with
U||   a soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator—well, then I
U||   shouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That’s
U||   all.”
U||   I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
U||   against the window, and Mr. Bilder’s face doubled its natural length
U||   with surprise.
U||   “God bless me!” he said. “If there ain’t old Bersicker come back by
U||   ’isself!”
U||   He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it
U||   seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so
U||   well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
U||   personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.
U||   After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder
U||   nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The
U||   animal itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
U||   picture-wolves—Red Riding Hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving her
U||   confidence in masquerade.
U||   The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The
U||   wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the
U||   children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of
U||   penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine
U||   prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender
U||   solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:—
U||   “There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
U||   didn’t I say it all along? Here’s his head all cut and full of broken
U||   glass. ’E’s been a-gettin’ over some bloomin’ wall or other. It’s a
U||   shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
U||   This ’ere’s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.”
U||   He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that
U||   satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
U||   fatted calf, and went off to report.
U||   I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
U||   to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   17 September.—I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
U||   books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,
U||   had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in
U||   rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was
U||   thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord
U||   into the Superintendent’s study is almost unknown. Without an instant’s
U||   pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,
U||   as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was
U||   too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my
U||   balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
U||   Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was
U||   sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a
U||   little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not
U||   intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
U||   keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the
U||   attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his
U||   employment positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the
U||   floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my
U||   wounded wrist. He was easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with
U||   the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again:
U||   “The blood is the life! The blood is the life!”
U||   I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of
U||   late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy’s
U||   illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and
U||   weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not
U||   summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well
U||   do without it.
U||   Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax.
U||   (Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by
U||   twenty-two hours.)
U||   “17 September.—Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not
U||   watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as
U||   placed; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as
U||   possible after arrival.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   18 September.—Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van
U||   Helsing’s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I
U||   know by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is
U||   possible that all may be well, but what may have happened? Surely there
U||   is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
U||   should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with
U||   me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy’s phonograph.
U||   Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra.
U||   17 September. Night.—I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
U||   one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact
U||   record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and
U||   have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the
U||   doing.
U||   I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.
U||   Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.
U||   I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
U||   sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now
U||   I know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in
U||   the next room—as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be—so that I might have
U||   called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to
U||   me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely
U||   sleep would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to
U||   be alone, I opened my door and called out: “Is there anybody there?”
U||   There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door
U||   again. Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a
U||   dog’s, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out,
U||   but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been
U||   buffeting its wings against the window. So I went back to bed again,
U||   but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and
U||   mother looked in; seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in,
U||   and sat by me. She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her
U||   wont:—
U||   “I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
U||   right.”
U||   I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
U||   and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she
U||   did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a
U||   while and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and
U||   I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was
U||   startled and a little frightened, and cried out: “What is that?” I
U||   tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I
U||   could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while
U||   there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after
U||   there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled
U||   on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in,
U||   and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great,
U||   gaunt grey wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a
U||   sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her.
U||   Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van
U||   Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me.
U||   For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a
U||   strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over—as if
U||   struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy
U||   for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I
U||   kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and
U||   a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the
U||   broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust
U||   that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried
U||   to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother’s poor body,
U||   which seemed to grow cold already—for her dear heart had ceased to
U||   beat—weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.
U||   The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
U||   consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the
U||   dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
U||   seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and
U||   stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
U||   nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to
U||   comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I
U||   could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them,
U||   and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was
U||   that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in
U||   through the broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the
U||   body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the
U||   bed after I had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I
U||   directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine.
U||   The door flew open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked,
U||   and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I
U||   had on my dear mother’s breast. When they were there I remembered what
U||   Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn’t like to remove them, and,
U||   besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was
U||   surprised that the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no
U||   answer, so I went to the dining-room to look for them.
U||   My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless
U||   on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the
U||   table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was
U||   suspicious, and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and
U||   looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother’s doctor
U||   uses for her—oh! did use—was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I
U||   am back in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone,
U||   save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with
U||   the dead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf
U||   through the broken window.
U||   The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
U||   the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God
U||   shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,
U||   where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother
U||   gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not
U||   survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!
U||CHAPTER XII
U||DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
U||   18 September.—I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early. Keeping
U||   my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently and
U||   rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her
U||   mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,
U||   finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I
U||   cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such
U||   an hour—for it was now ten o’clock—and so rang and knocked again, but
U||   more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed
U||   only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this
U||   desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
U||   tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come,
U||   too late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours
U||   of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful
U||   relapses; and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance
U||   an entry anywhere.
U||   I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened
U||   and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard
U||   the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at the
U||   gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.
U||   When he saw me, he gasped out:—
U||   “Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did
U||   you not get my telegram?”
U||   I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his
U||   telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming
U||   here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused
U||   and raised his hat as he said solemnly:—
U||   “Then I fear we are too late. God’s will be done!” With his usual
U||   recuperative energy, he went on: “Come. If there be no way open to get
U||   in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.”
U||   We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen
U||   window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and
U||   handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I
U||   attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then
U||   with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
U||   opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There
U||   was no one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close
U||   at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the
U||   dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found
U||   four servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them
U||   dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in
U||   the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked
U||   at each other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them
U||   later.” Then we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we
U||   paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could
U||   hear. With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently,
U||   and entered the room.
U||   How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and
U||   her mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a
U||   white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught
U||   through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look
U||   of terror fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and
U||   still more drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found
U||   upon her mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two
U||   little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white
U||   and mangled. Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head
U||   almost touching poor Lucy’s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his
U||   head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to
U||   me:—
U||   “It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!”
U||   I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
U||   it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I
U||   found on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more
U||   restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not
U||   stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy,
U||   as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the
U||   palms of her hands. He said to me:—
U||   “I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those
U||   maids. Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard.
U||   Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly
U||   as cold as that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do
U||   anything more.”
U||   I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
U||   women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently
U||   affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her
U||   sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
U||   them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with
U||   them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life
U||   was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
U||   Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
U||   as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and
U||   boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We
U||   got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst
U||   we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One
U||   of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then
U||   she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had
U||   come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that
U||   he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the
U||   message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.
U||   I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly
U||   earnest. I knew—as he knew—that it was a stand-up fight with death, and
U||   in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not
U||   understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:—
U||   “If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
U||   away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.” He went
U||   on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.
U||   Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
U||   be of some effect. Lucy’s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the
U||   stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing’s
U||   face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her
U||   in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:—
U||   “The first gain is ours! Check to the King!”
U||   We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and
U||   laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I
U||   noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her
U||   throat. She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not
U||   worse than, we had ever seen her.
U||   Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
U||   and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
U||   out of the room.
U||   “We must consult as to what is to be done,” he said as we descended the
U||   stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in,
U||   he closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened,
U||   but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette
U||   of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly
U||   observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light
U||   enough for our purposes. Van Helsing’s sternness was somewhat relieved
U||   by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about
U||   something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:—
U||   “What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have
U||   another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s life
U||   won’t be worth an hour’s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am
U||   exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have
U||   courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his
U||   veins for her?”
U||   “What’s the matter with me, anyhow?”
U||   The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
U||   relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van
U||   Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
U||   glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey Morris!” and
U||   rushed towards him with outstretched hands.
U||   “What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met.
U||   “I guess Art is the cause.”
U||   He handed me a telegram:—
U||   “Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
U||   Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.
U||   Do not delay.—Holmwood.”
U||   “I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to
U||   tell me what to do.”
U||   Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
U||   the eyes as he said:—
U||   “A brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in
U||   trouble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against
U||   us for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.”
U||   Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart
U||   to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it
U||   told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
U||   veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the
U||   other occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to
U||   see and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and
U||   Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and
U||   with good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor
U||   watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of
U||   the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey
U||   lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready
U||   a good breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room
U||   where Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a
U||   sheet or two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and
U||   was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a
U||   look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt
U||   solved. He handed me the paper saying only: “It dropped from Lucy’s
U||   breast when we carried her to the bath.”
U||   When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause
U||   asked him: “In God’s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,
U||   mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” I was so bewildered that I
U||   did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took
U||   the paper, saying:—
U||   “Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know
U||   and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what
U||   is it that you came to me to say?” This brought me back to fact, and I
U||   was all myself again.
U||   “I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act
U||   properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
U||   to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we
U||   had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and
U||   you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs.
U||   Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of
U||   it. Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself
U||   to the registrar and go on to the undertaker.”
U||   “Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be
U||   sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
U||   love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one
U||   old man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all
U||   the more for it! Now go.”
U||   In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling
U||   him that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was
U||   now going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told
U||   him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:—
U||   “When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to
U||   ourselves?” I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about
U||   the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
U||   the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.
U||   When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him
U||   as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still
U||   sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at
U||   her side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he
U||   expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
U||   So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where
U||   the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful,
U||   or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he
U||   said to me:—
U||   “Jack Seward, I don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where I’ve no
U||   right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl
U||   and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I
U||   can’t help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that’s
U||   wrong with her? The Dutchman—and a fine old fellow he is; I can see
U||   that—said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
U||   another transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
U||   Now I know well that you medical men speak in camera, and that a man
U||   must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is
U||   no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that
U||   so?”
U||   “That’s so,” I said, and he went on:—
U||   “I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did
U||   to-day. Is not that so?”
U||   “That’s so.”
U||   “And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at
U||   his own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so
U||   quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to
U||   grass all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had
U||   got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left
U||   open, there wasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had
U||   to put a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me
U||   without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?” As
U||   he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture
U||   of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of
U||   the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain.
U||   His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him—and
U||   there was a royal lot of it, too—to keep him from breaking down. I
U||   paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything
U||   which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much,
U||   and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering,
U||   so I answered in the same phrase: “That’s so.”
U||   “And how long has this been going on?”
U||   “About ten days.”
U||   “Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature
U||   that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
U||   of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” Then,
U||   coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: “What took it
U||   out?”
U||   I shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the crux. Van Helsing is simply
U||   frantic about it, and I am at my wits’ end. I can’t even hazard a
U||   guess. There has been a series of little circumstances which have
U||   thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But
U||   these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be well—or ill.”
U||   Quincey held out his hand. “Count me in,” he said. “You and the
U||   Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.”
U||   When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was to feel
U||   in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van
U||   Helsing had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it
U||   where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye
U||   then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked
U||   around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud
U||   cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face. We both
U||   understood what that meant—that she had realised to the full her
U||   mother’s death; so we tried what we could to comfort her. Doubtless
U||   sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and
U||   spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time. We told her that
U||   either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that
U||   seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a very
U||   odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her
U||   breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces
U||   from her. All the same, however, she went on with the action of
U||   tearing, as though the material were still in her hands; finally she
U||   lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments.
U||   Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought,
U||   but he said nothing.
U||   19 September.—All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid to
U||   sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and I
U||   took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment
U||   unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew
U||   that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.
U||   When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor
U||   Lucy’s strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
U||   nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she
U||   slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her,
U||   between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger,
U||   although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth
U||   showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked
U||   positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of
U||   her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self,
U||   although a dying one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we
U||   telegraphed for him. Quincey went off to meet him at the station.
U||   When he arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting full
U||   and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave
U||   more colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply
U||   choking with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had
U||   passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for
U||   it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was
U||   possible were shortened. Arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as a
U||   stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than
U||   she had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and
U||   spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.
U||   It was now nearly one o’clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
U||   her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering
U||   this on Lucy’s phonograph. Until six o’clock they are to try to rest. I
U||   fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
U||   great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.
U||   Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.
U||   (Unopened by her.)
U||   “17 September.
U||   “My dearest Lucy,—
U||   “It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You
U||   will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my
U||   budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived
U||   at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had
U||   an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there
U||   were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together.
U||   After dinner Mr. Hawkins said:—
U||   “‘My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
U||   blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with
U||   love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here
U||   with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and
U||   in my will I have left you everything.’ I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan
U||   and the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.
U||   “So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both
U||   my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the
U||   cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the
U||   old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead
U||   cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the
U||   manner of rooks—and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging
U||   things and housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day;
U||   for, now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all
U||   about the clients.
U||   “How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for
U||   a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on
U||   my shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning
U||   to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by
U||   the long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a
U||   sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his
U||   usual placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent
U||   as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust.
U||   And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be
U||   married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are
U||   you to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all
U||   about it, dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing
U||   which interests you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to
U||   send his ‘respectful duty,’ but I do not think that is good enough from
U||   the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as
U||   you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and
U||   tenses of the verb, I send you simply his ‘love’ instead. Good-bye, my
U||   dearest Lucy, and all blessings on you.
U||   “Yours,
U||   “Mina Harker.”
U||   Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,
U||   etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D.
U||   “20 September.
U||   “My dear Sir,—
U||   “In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of
U||   everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield,
U||   there is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had
U||   a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was
U||   unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier’s cart
U||   with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on
U||   ours—the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away.
U||   The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were
U||   strangers. I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke
U||   after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed
U||   the window of Renfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from
U||   within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to.
U||   The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by
U||   telling him to “shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man
U||   accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he
U||   would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and
U||   signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking
U||   the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had
U||   got to by saying: ‘Lor’ bless yer, sir, I wouldn’t mind what was said
U||   to me in a bloomin’ madhouse. I pity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to
U||   live in the house with a wild beast like that.’ Then he asked his way
U||   civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was;
U||   he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our
U||   man. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger,
U||   since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent
U||   fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my
U||   astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner. I tried to
U||   get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as
U||   to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious
U||   of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another
U||   instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again.
U||   This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was
U||   running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me, and
U||   ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief. My fear was
U||   justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down
U||   the road, having on it some great wooden boxes. The men were wiping
U||   their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent
U||   exercise. Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and
U||   pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the
U||   ground. If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would
U||   have killed the man there and then. The other fellow jumped down and
U||   struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip. It was a
U||   terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and
U||   struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were
U||   kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly
U||   men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master
U||   him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he
U||   began to shout: ‘I’ll frustrate them! They shan’t rob me! they shan’t
U||   murder me by inches! I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’ and all sorts
U||   of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty
U||   that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room. One
U||   of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all
U||   right; and he is going on well.
U||   “The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
U||   damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their
U||   threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
U||   the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it
U||   had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
U||   raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
U||   him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
U||   state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
U||   their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
U||   labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their
U||   drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
U||   with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
U||   that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of
U||   meeting so ‘bloomin’ good a bloke’ as your correspondent. I took their
U||   names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as
U||   follows:—Jack Smollet, of Dudding’s Rents, King George’s Road, Great
U||   Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley’s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal
U||   Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and
U||   Shipment Company, Orange Master’s Yard, Soho.
U||   “I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall
U||   wire you at once if there is anything of importance.
U||   “Believe me, dear Sir,
U||   “Yours faithfully,
U||   “Patrick Hennessey.”
U||   Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.
U||   (Unopened by her.)
U||   “18 September.
U||   “My dearest Lucy,—
U||   “Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
U||   Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love
U||   him that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew
U||   either father or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is a real
U||   blow to me. Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he
U||   feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended
U||   him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son
U||   and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is
U||   wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another
U||   account. He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him
U||   makes him nervous. He begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up,
U||   and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is
U||   here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most.
U||   Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as
U||   his—a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise
U||   from clerk to master in a few years—should be so injured that the very
U||   essence of its strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with
U||   my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must
U||   tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful
U||   appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can
U||   confide in. I dread coming up to London, as we must do the day after
U||   to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be
U||   buried in the grave with his father. As there are no relations at all,
U||   Jonathan will have to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see
U||   you, dearest, if only for a few minutes. Forgive me for troubling you.
U||   With all blessings,
U||   “Your loving

U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   20 September.—Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry
U||   to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world
U||   and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard
U||   this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has
U||   been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late—Lucy’s mother
U||   and Arthur’s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.
U||   I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to
U||   go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him
U||   that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
U||   all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he
U||   agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my child,” he
U||   said; “come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow
U||   and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know
U||   of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and
U||   alarms. Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there
U||   are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our
U||   sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak,
U||   and even if we sleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing
U||   look on Lucy’s face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the
U||   lawn. She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all
U||   was as it should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in
U||   this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole
U||   of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the
U||   silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough
U||   chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat
U||   stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed
U||   the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer
U||   and sharper than they had been in the morning. In particular, by some
U||   trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the
U||   rest. I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same
U||   moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I
U||   went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind.
U||   There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by
U||   a great bat, which wheeled round—doubtless attracted by the light,
U||   although so dim—and every now and again struck the window with its
U||   wings. When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved
U||   slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat. I
U||   replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.
U||   Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.
U||   She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be
U||   with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had
U||   hitherto so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment
U||   she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It
U||   was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with
U||   the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when
U||   she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making
U||   any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had
U||   many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many
U||   times.
U||   At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen
U||   into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s
U||   face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me
U||   in a sharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he bent
U||   down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her
U||   carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from
U||   her throat. As he did so he started back, and I could hear his
U||   ejaculation, “Mein Gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent
U||   over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.
U||   The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
U||   For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face
U||   at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:—
U||   “She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference,
U||   mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor
U||   boy, and let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have
U||   promised him.”
U||   I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but
U||   when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
U||   he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy
U||   was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van
U||   Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with
U||   his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,
U||   perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
U||   shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I
U||   said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
U||   and easiest for her.”
U||   When we came into Lucy’s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with
U||   his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
U||   everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy’s
U||   hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we
U||   came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
U||   softly:—
U||   “Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!” He was stooping to
U||   kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. “No,” he whispered, “not
U||   yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”
U||   So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
U||   with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then
U||   gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her
U||   breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired
U||   child’s.
U||   And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed
U||   in the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the
U||   pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than
U||   ever. In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her
U||   eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft,
U||   voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:—
U||   “Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” Arthur bent
U||   eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like
U||   me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him
U||   by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength
U||   which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him
U||   almost across the room.
U||   “Not for your life!” he said; “not for your living soul and hers!” And
U||   he stood between them like a lion at bay.
U||   Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do
U||   or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised
U||   the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.
U||   I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as
U||   of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
U||   together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.
U||   Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
U||   putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brown
U||   one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in a
U||   faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his! Oh,
U||   guard him, and give me peace!”
U||   “I swear it!” he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
U||   hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said
U||   to him: “Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
U||   forehead, and only once.”
U||   Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.
U||   Lucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely,
U||   took Arthur’s arm, and drew him away.
U||   And then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
U||   ceased.
U||   “It is all over,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!”
U||   I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where
U||   he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that
U||   nearly broke me down to see.
U||   I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy,
U||   and his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.
U||   Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
U||   recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
U||   deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working
U||   of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
U||   might be.
U||   “We thought her dying whilst she slept,
U||   And sleeping when she died.”
U||   I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:—
U||   “Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!”
U||   He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:—
U||   “Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!”
U||   When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:—
U||   “We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.”
U||CHAPTER XIII
U||DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—continued.
U||   THE funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and
U||   her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly
U||   formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
U||   afflicted—or blessed—with something of his own obsequious suavity. Even
U||   the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me,
U||   in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from
U||   the death-chamber:—
U||   “She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege to
U||   attend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our
U||   establishment!”
U||   I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from
U||   the disordered state of things in the household. There were no
U||   relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend
U||   at his father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should
U||   have been bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it
U||   upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over
U||   Lucy’s papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a
U||   foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and
U||   so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:—
U||   “I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But
U||   this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the
U||   coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more—such
U||   as this.”
U||   As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
U||   in Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.
U||   “When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.
U||   Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch
U||   here in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself
U||   search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
U||   the hands of strangers.”
U||   I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
U||   the name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written to
U||   him. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions
U||   regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the
U||   letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,
U||   saying:—
U||   “Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to
U||   you.”
U||   “Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:—
U||   “I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find
U||   I have, all that there was—only some letters and a few memoranda, and a
U||   diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say
U||   nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
U||   his sanction, I shall use some.”
U||   When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:—
U||   “And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you
U||   and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but
U||   for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”
U||   Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had
U||   certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small
U||   chapelle ardente. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
U||   and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the
U||   winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and
U||   turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the
U||   tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy’s
U||   loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had
U||   passed, instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had
U||   but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my
U||   eyes that I was looking at a corpse.
U||   The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and
U||   there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: “Remain till I
U||   return,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic
U||   from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
U||   placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
U||   took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and
U||   placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we
U||   came away.
U||   I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the
U||   door, he entered, and at once began to speak:—
U||   “To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem
U||   knives.”
U||   “Must we make an autopsy?” I asked.
U||   “Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you
U||   now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out
U||   her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen
U||   with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that
U||   make the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John,
U||   that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall
U||   operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but
U||   for Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral
U||   to-morrow, and he will want to see her—to see it. Then, when she is
U||   coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep.
U||   We shall unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then
U||   replace all, so that none know, save we alone.”
U||   “But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body
U||   without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and
U||   nothing to gain by it—no good to her, to us, to science, to human
U||   knowledge—why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”
U||   For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
U||   tenderness:—
U||   “Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more
U||   because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden
U||   that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you
U||   shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant
U||   things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
U||   did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err—I am but
U||   man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you
U||   send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
U||   horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love—though she was
U||   dying—and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw
U||   how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too,
U||   so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you
U||   not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful?
U||   Yes!
U||   “Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many
U||   years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so
U||   strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend
U||   John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is
U||   not perhaps well. And if I work—as work I shall, no matter trust or no
U||   trust—without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,
U||   oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!” He paused
U||   a moment and went on solemnly: “Friend John, there are strange and
U||   terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
U||   a good end. Will you not have faith in me?”
U||   I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,
U||   and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without
U||   moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage—she had
U||   her back towards me, so did not see me—and go into the room where Lucy
U||   lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
U||   to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl
U||   putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
U||   alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
U||   might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....
U||   I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van
U||   Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and
U||   said:—
U||   “You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”
U||   “Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly
U||   impressed me.
U||   “Because,” he said sternly, “it is too late—or too early. See!” Here he
U||   held up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.”
U||   “How, stolen,” I asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”
U||   “Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
U||   woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely
U||   come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
U||   unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.”
U||   He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a
U||   new puzzle to grapple with.
U||   The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.
U||   Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial
U||   and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
U||   cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for
U||   some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
U||   in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain
U||   entailed property of Lucy’s father’s which now, in default of direct
U||   issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
U||   real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
U||   told us so much he went on:—
U||   “Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition,
U||   and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter
U||   either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a
U||   matrimonial alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we
U||   almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not
U||   prepared to carry out her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative
U||   but to accept. We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of
U||   a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy
U||   of our judgment. Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any
U||   other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying
U||   out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter
U||   would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only
U||   survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there
U||   were no will—and a will was a practical impossibility in such a
U||   case—have been treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case
U||   Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the
U||   world; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon
U||   their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire
U||   stranger. I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result,
U||   perfectly rejoiced.”
U||   He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part—in which
U||   he was officially interested—of so great a tragedy, was an
U||   object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.
U||   He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and
U||   see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to
U||   us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
U||   criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o’clock,
U||   so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in
U||   very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,
U||   true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and
U||   there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at
U||   once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
U||   explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be
U||   less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiancée
U||   quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
U||   exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left
U||   them the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his
U||   feelings as we could avoid were saved.
U||   Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
U||   manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
U||   much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
U||   attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a
U||   bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he
U||   was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some
U||   constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to
U||   bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as
U||   I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and
U||   led me in, saying huskily:—
U||   “You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was
U||   no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don’t know how to
U||   thank you for all you have done for her. I can’t think yet....”
U||   Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
U||   laid his head on my breast, crying:—
U||   “Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me
U||   all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live
U||   for.”
U||   I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much
U||   expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
U||   shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man’s
U||   heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I
U||   said softly to him:—
U||   “Come and look at her.”
U||   Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.
U||   God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her
U||   loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he
U||   fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At
U||   last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:—
U||   “Jack, is she really dead?”
U||   I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest—for I felt
U||   that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer
U||   than I could help—that it often happened that after death faces became
U||   softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
U||   especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
U||   suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
U||   kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and
U||   long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the
U||   coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in
U||   his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,
U||   fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.
U||   I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said
U||   good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s
U||   men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When
U||   he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur’s question, and he
U||   replied:—
U||   “I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!”
U||   We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make
U||   the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but
U||   when we had lit our cigars he said—
U||   “Lord——”; but Arthur interrupted him:—
U||   “No, no, not that, for God’s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me,
U||   sir: I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is
U||   so recent.”
U||   The Professor answered very sweetly:—
U||   “I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you
U||   ‘Mr.,’ and I have grown to love you—yes, my dear boy, to love you—as
U||   Arthur.”
U||   Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’s warmly.
U||   “Call me what you will,” he said. “I hope I may always have the title
U||   of a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you
U||   for your goodness to my poor dear.” He paused a moment, and went on: “I
U||   know that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I
U||   was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so—you
U||   remember”—the Professor nodded—“you must forgive me.”
U||   He answered with a grave kindness:—
U||   “I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such
U||   violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not—that you
U||   cannot—trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be
U||   more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot—and may
U||   not—and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust
U||   shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
U||   though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from
U||   first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her
U||   dear sake to whom I swore to protect.”
U||   “And, indeed, indeed, sir,” said Arthur warmly, “I shall in all ways
U||   trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are
U||   Jack’s friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like.”
U||   The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to
U||   speak, and finally said:—
U||   “May I ask you something now?”
U||   “Certainly.”
U||   “You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?”
U||   “No, poor dear; I never thought of it.”
U||   “And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will.
U||   I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy’s papers and
U||   letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,
U||   be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them
U||   before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch
U||   them—no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep
U||   them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them
U||   safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them
U||   back to you. It’s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not,
U||   for Lucy’s sake?”
U||   Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:—
U||   “Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this
U||   I am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble
U||   you with questions till the time comes.”
U||   The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:—
U||   “And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be
U||   all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too—you most of
U||   all, my dear boy—will have to pass through the bitter water before we
U||   reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do
U||   our duty, and all will be well!”
U||   I slept on a sofa in Arthur’s room that night. Van Helsing did not go
U||   to bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
U||   never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn
U||   with the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and
U||   rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.
U||   Mina Harker’s Journal.
U||   22 September.—In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.
U||   It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
U||   between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and
U||   no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a
U||   partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and
U||   Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me
U||   about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand—see what
U||   unexpected prosperity does for us—so it may be as well to freshen it up
U||   again with an exercise anyhow....
U||   The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves
U||   and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his
U||   London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the
U||   President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in
U||   hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....
U||   We came back to town quietly, taking a ’bus to Hyde Park Corner.
U||   Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while,
U||   so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
U||   sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think
U||   of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.
U||   Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days
U||   before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can’t go on
U||   for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without
U||   the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and
U||   he was my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us—and we didn’t
U||   care if they did—so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful
U||   girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside
U||   Guiliano’s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt
U||   me, and he said under his breath: “My God!” I am always anxious about
U||   Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I
U||   turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.
U||   He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror
U||   and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose
U||   and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the
U||   pretty girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either
U||   of us, and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face;
U||   it was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that
U||   looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like
U||   an animal’s. Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would
U||   notice. I feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I
U||   asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently
U||   thinking that I knew as much about it as he did: “Do you see who it
U||   is?”
U||   “No, dear,” I said; “I don’t know him; who is it?” His answer seemed to
U||   shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was
U||   to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:—
U||   “It is the man himself!”
U||   The poor dear was evidently terrified at something—very greatly
U||   terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to
U||   support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of
U||   the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
U||   off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
U||   moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a
U||   hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:—
U||   “I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be
U||   so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!” He was
U||   distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the
U||   subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him
U||   away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little
U||   further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was
U||   a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady
U||   place. After a few minutes’ staring at nothing, Jonathan’s eyes closed,
U||   and he went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I
U||   thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about
U||   twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:—
U||   “Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
U||   Come, and we’ll have a cup of tea somewhere.” He had evidently
U||   forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had
U||   forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of. I don’t like this
U||   lapsing into forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the
U||   brain. I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but
U||   I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come,
U||   I fear, when I must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh,
U||   Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for
U||   your own dear sake.
U||   Later.—A sad home-coming in every way—the house empty of the dear soul
U||   who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight
U||   relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he
U||   may be:—
U||   “You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
U||   that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.”
U||   Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor
U||   Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have
U||   lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our
U||   troubles.
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   22 September.—It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has
U||   taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe
U||   in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy’s death as
U||   any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If
U||   America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the
U||   world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to
U||   his journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns
U||   to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can
U||   only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says
U||   he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old
U||   fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even
U||   his iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see,
U||   putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we
U||   were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part
U||   in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy’s
U||   veins; I could see Van Helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns.
U||   Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been
U||   really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of
U||   us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall.
U||   Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing
U||   and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave
U||   way to a regular fit of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it
U||   was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humour
U||   asserting itself under very terrible conditions. He laughed till he
U||   cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and
U||   misjudge; and then he cried, till he laughed again; and laughed and
U||   cried together, just as a woman does. I tried to be stern with him, as
U||   one is to a woman under the circumstances; but it had no effect. Men
U||   and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or
U||   weakness! Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why
U||   his mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way
U||   characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious.
U||   He said:—
U||   “Ah, you don’t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,
U||   though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But
U||   no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come
U||   just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
U||   door and say, ‘May I come in?’ is not the true laughter. No! he is a
U||   king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no
U||   time of suitability. He say, ‘I am here.’ Behold, in example I grieve
U||   my heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her,
U||   though I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my
U||   other sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at
U||   her very grave—laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop
U||   upon her coffin and say ‘Thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back
U||   the blood from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy—that dear
U||   boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live,
U||   and with his hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him
U||   so. And yet when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the
U||   quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man—not
U||   even to you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences than
U||   father and son—yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and
U||   shout and bellow in my ear, ‘Here I am! here I am!’ till the blood come
U||   dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my
U||   cheek. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world
U||   full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come
U||   he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry
U||   bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall—all dance
U||   together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him.
U||   And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we
U||   men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us
U||   different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain on the ropes, they
U||   brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break.
U||   But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain
U||   again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be.”
U||   I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as
U||   I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he
U||   answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different
U||   tone:—
U||   “Oh, it was the grim irony of it all—this so lovely lady garlanded with
U||   flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if
U||   she were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that
U||   lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the
U||   mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going
U||   ‘Toll! toll! toll!’ so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
U||   garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
U||   their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And
U||   all for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?”
U||   “Well, for the life of me, Professor,” I said, “I can’t see anything to
U||   laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle
U||   than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
U||   Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.”
U||   “Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins
U||   had made her truly his bride?”
U||   “Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.”
U||   “Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then
U||   what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a
U||   polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by
U||   Church’s law, though no wits, all gone—even I, who am faithful husband
U||   to this now-no-wife, am bigamist.”
U||   “I don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” I said; and I did
U||   not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
U||   his hand on my arm, and said:—
U||   “Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others
U||   when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
U||   If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;
U||   if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
U||   now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him—for
U||   he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time—maybe you would
U||   perhaps pity me the most of all.”
U||   I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.
U||   “Because I know!”
U||   And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will
U||   sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her
U||   kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming
U||   London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,
U||   and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.
U||   So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin
U||   another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with
U||   different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
U||   romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my
U||   life-work, I say sadly and without hope,
U||   “FINIS.”
U||   “The Westminster Gazette,” 25 September.
U||   A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.
U||   The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a
U||   series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
U||   was known to the writers of headlines as “The Kensington Horror,” or
U||   “The Stabbing Woman,” or “The Woman in Black.” During the past two or
U||   three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
U||   home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all
U||   these cases the children were too young to give any properly
U||   intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
U||   is that they had been with a “bloofer lady.” It has always been late in
U||   the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
U||   children have not been found until early in the following morning. It
U||   is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child
U||   missed gave as his reason for being away that a “bloofer lady” had
U||   asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and
U||   used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite
U||   game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles.
U||   A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending
U||   to be the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists
U||   might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing
U||   the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
U||   principles of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the
U||   popular rôle at these al fresco performances. Our correspondent naïvely
U||   says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some
U||   of these grubby-faced little children pretend—and even imagine
U||   themselves—to be.
U||   There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of
U||   the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
U||   slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might
U||   be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance
U||   individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
U||   a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been
U||   instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially
U||   when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog
U||   which may be about.

U||   Extra Special.
U||   THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.
U||   ANOTHER CHILD INJURED.
U||   The “Bloofer Lady.”
U||   We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
U||   night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at
U||   the Shooter’s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less
U||   frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the
U||   throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and
U||   looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common
U||   story to tell of being lured away by the “bloofer lady.”
U||CHAPTER XIV
U||MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL
U||   23 September.—Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that
U||   he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
U||   things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the
U||   responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,
U||   and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his
U||   advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
U||   him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch
U||   at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign
U||   journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it....
U||   24 September.—I hadn’t the heart to write last night; that terrible
U||   record of Jonathan’s upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,
U||   whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth
U||   in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those
U||   terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
U||   never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man
U||   we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I
U||   suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
U||   train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our
U||   wedding-day he said: “Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back
U||   to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.” There seems to be
U||   through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was
U||   coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his
U||   teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must
U||   not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter
U||   this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other
U||   eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,
U||   poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let
U||   him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets
U||   over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask
U||   him questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.
U||   Letter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker.
U||   “24 September.
U||   (Confidence)
U||   “Dear Madam,—
U||   “I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I
U||   sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra’s death. By the kindness of
U||   Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am
U||   deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I
U||   find some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and
U||   how you love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me.
U||   It is for others’ good that I ask—to redress great wrong, and to lift
U||   much and terrible troubles—that may be more great than you can know.
U||   May it be that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John
U||   Seward and of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must
U||   keep it private for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to
U||   see you at once if you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and
U||   when. I implore your pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor
U||   Lucy, and know how good you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray
U||   you, if it may be, enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your
U||   pardon, and forgive me.
U||   “Van Helsing.”
U||   Telegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing.
U||   “25 September.—Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch
U||   it. Can see you any time you call.
U||   “Wilhelmina Harker.”
U||   MINA HARKER’S JOURNAL.
U||   25 September.—I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws
U||   near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that it
U||   will throw some light upon Jonathan’s sad experience; and as he
U||   attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
U||   her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
U||   sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real
U||   truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
U||   imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of
U||   course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and
U||   that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost
U||   forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have
U||   told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew
U||   all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that
U||   he may understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to
U||   Mrs. Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were
U||   it even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too,
U||   Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and
U||   anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.
U||   I suppose a cry does us all good at times—clears the air as other rain
U||   does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
U||   then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day
U||   and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do
U||   hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
U||   occur to upset him. It is two o’clock, and the doctor will be here soon
U||   now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan’s journal unless he asks me. I am
U||   so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he
U||   asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.
U||   Later.—He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all
U||   makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all
U||   possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan’s journal
U||   first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor,
U||   dear Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this
U||   may not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be
U||   even a consolation and a help to him—terrible though it be and awful in
U||   its consequences—to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain
U||   did not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the
U||   doubt which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter
U||   which—waking or dreaming—may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied
U||   and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man
U||   as well as a clever one if he is Arthur’s friend and Dr. Seward’s, and
U||   if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel
U||   from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature.
U||   When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then,
U||   please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end. I used
U||   to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan’s friend on
U||   “The Exeter News” told him that memory was everything in such work—that
U||   you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if
U||   you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare interview; I
U||   shall try to record it verbatim.
U||   It was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. I took my courage à
U||   deux mains and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and
U||   announced “Dr. Van Helsing.”
U||   I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,
U||   strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest
U||   and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The
U||   poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and
U||   power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears.
U||   The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute,
U||   mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick,
U||   sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come
U||   down and the mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at
U||   first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges
U||   wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly
U||   tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark
U||   blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with
U||   the man’s moods. He said to me:—
U||   “Mrs. Harker, is it not?” I bowed assent.
U||   “That was Miss Mina Murray?” Again I assented.
U||   “It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear
U||   child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.”
U||   “Sir,” I said, “you could have no better claim on me than that you were
U||   a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.” And I held out my hand. He took
U||   it and said tenderly:—
U||   “Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
U||   good, but I had yet to learn——” He finished his speech with a courtly
U||   bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at
U||   once began:—
U||   “I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin
U||   to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were
U||   with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary—you need not look
U||   surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
U||   imitation of you—and in that diary she traces by inference certain
U||   things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
U||   great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much
U||   kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.”
U||   “I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.”
U||   “Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always
U||   so with young ladies.”
U||   “No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you
U||   if you like.”
U||   “Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.” I
U||   could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit—I suppose it is
U||   some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
U||   mouths—so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful
U||   bow, and said:—
U||   “May I read it?”
U||   “If you wish,” I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for
U||   an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.
U||   “Oh, you so clever woman!” he said. “I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was
U||   a man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
U||   And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?
U||   Alas! I know not the shorthand.” By this time my little joke was over,
U||   and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my
U||   workbasket and handed it to him.
U||   “Forgive me,” I said: “I could not help it; but I had been thinking
U||   that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might
U||   not have time to wait—not on my account, but because I know your time
U||   must be precious—I have written it out on the typewriter for you.”
U||   He took it and his eyes glistened. “You are so good,” he said. “And may
U||   I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.”
U||   “By all means,” I said, “read it over whilst I order lunch; and then
U||   you can ask me questions whilst we eat.” He bowed and settled himself
U||   in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the
U||   papers, whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might
U||   not be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up
U||   and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to
U||   me and took me by both hands.
U||   “Oh, Madam Mina,” he said, “how can I say what I owe to you? This paper
U||   is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with
U||   so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But
U||   that you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you
U||   so clever woman. Madam”—he said this very solemnly—“if ever Abraham Van
U||   Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
U||   It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a
U||   friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for
U||   you and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are
U||   lights; you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good
U||   life, and your husband will be blessed in you.”
U||   “But, doctor, you praise me too much, and—and you do not know me.”
U||   “Not know you—I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
U||   women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
U||   him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you
U||   have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
U||   line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
U||   marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell
U||   all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
U||   angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
U||   angels’ eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
U||   you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your
U||   husband—tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and
U||   is he strong and hearty?” I saw here an opening to ask him about
U||   Jonathan, so I said:—
U||   “He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr.
U||   Hawkins’s death.” He interrupted:—
U||   “Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.” I went
U||   on:—
U||   “I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he
U||   had a sort of shock.”
U||   “A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind
U||   of a shock was it?”
U||   “He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
U||   which led to his brain fever.” And here the whole thing seemed to
U||   overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
U||   experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
U||   has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I
U||   was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
U||   him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands
U||   and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held
U||   my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:—
U||   “My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have
U||   not had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to
U||   here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen
U||   such nobility that I feel more than ever—and it has grown with my
U||   advancing years—the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I
U||   come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope—hope, not
U||   in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to
U||   make life happy—good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good
U||   lesson for the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may
U||   here be of some use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer
U||   within the range of my study and experience. I promise you that I will
U||   gladly do all for him that I can—all to make his life strong and manly,
U||   and your life a happy one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and
U||   perhaps over-anxious. Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so
U||   pale; and what he like not where he love, is not to his good. Therefore
U||   for his sake you must eat and smile. You have told me all about Lucy,
U||   and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in
U||   Exeter to-night, for I want to think much over what you have told me,
U||   and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if I may. And then,
U||   too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan’s trouble so far as you can,
U||   but not yet. You must eat now; afterwards you shall tell me all.”
U||   After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:—
U||   “And now tell me all about him.” When it came to speaking to this great
U||   learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and
U||   Jonathan a madman—that journal is all so strange—and I hesitated to go
U||   on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I
U||   trusted him, so I said:—
U||   “Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not
U||   laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of
U||   fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I
U||   have even half believed some very strange things.” He reassured me by
U||   his manner as well as his words when he said:—
U||   “Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding
U||   which I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think
U||   little of any one’s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried
U||   to keep an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that
U||   could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the
U||   things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane.”
U||   “Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my
U||   mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,
U||   but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and
U||   Jonathan’s. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
U||   happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
U||   judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
U||   me what you think.”
U||   “I promise,” he said as I gave him the papers; “I shall in the morning,
U||   so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.”
U||   “Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
U||   with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
U||   will leave you at Paddington before eight.” He was surprised at my
U||   knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made
U||   up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in
U||   case he is in a hurry.
U||   So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here
U||   thinking—thinking I don’t know what.
U||   Letter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker.
U||   “25 September, 6 o’clock.
U||   “Dear Madam Mina,—
U||   “I have read your husband’s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without
U||   doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is true! I will pledge my life
U||   on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no
U||   dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of
U||   men, that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to
U||   that room—ay, and going a second time—is not one to be injured in
U||   permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I
U||   swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to
U||   ask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you,
U||   for I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle—dazzle more
U||   than ever, and I must think.
U||   “Yours the most faithful,
U||   “Abraham Van Helsing.”
U||   Letter, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing.
U||   “25 September, 6:30 p. m.
U||   “My dear Dr. Van Helsing,—
U||   “A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight
U||   off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in
U||   the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really
U||   in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a
U||   wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from
U||   Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear
U||   to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come
U||   to breakfast at eight o’clock, if this be not too early for you? You
U||   can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will
U||   bring you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it
U||   that, if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.
U||   “Believe me,
U||   “Your faithful and grateful friend,
U||   “Mina Harker.”
U||   Jonathan Harker’s Journal.
U||   26 September.—I thought never to write in this diary again, but the
U||   time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and
U||   when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing’s visit, and of her
U||   having given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has
U||   been about me. She showed me in the doctor’s letter that all I wrote
U||   down was true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt
U||   as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt
U||   impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I know, I am
U||   not afraid, even of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his
U||   design in getting to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger,
U||   and how? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he
U||   is anything like what Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over.
U||   Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and
U||   bring him over....
U||   He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where
U||   he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned
U||   my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:—
U||   “But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.” It was
U||   so funny to hear my wife called “Madam Mina” by this kindly,
U||   strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:—
U||   “I was ill, I have had a shock; but you have cured me already.”
U||   “And how?”
U||   “By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything
U||   took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the
U||   evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know
U||   what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto
U||   been the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I
U||   mistrusted myself. Doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt
U||   everything, even yourself. No, you don’t; you couldn’t with eyebrows
U||   like yours.” He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:—
U||   “So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
U||   so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
U||   pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.” I
U||   would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded
U||   and stood silent.
U||   “She is one of God’s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men
U||   and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its
U||   light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
U||   egoist—and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
U||   selfish. And you, sir—I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
U||   and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the
U||   knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You
U||   will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our
U||   lives.”
U||   We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite
U||   choky.
U||   “And now,” he said, “may I ask you for some more help? I have a great
U||   task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.
U||   Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I
U||   may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.”
U||   “Look here, sir,” I said, “does what you have to do concern the Count?”
U||   “It does,” he said solemnly.
U||   “Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you
U||   will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.
U||   You can take them with you and read them in the train.”
U||   After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he
U||   said:—
U||   “Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina
U||   too.”
U||   “We shall both come when you will,” I said.
U||   I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous
U||   night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for
U||   the train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed
U||   to catch something in one of them, “The Westminster Gazette”—I knew it
U||   by the colour—and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
U||   groaning to himself: “Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!” I do not
U||   think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and
U||   the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of
U||   the window and waved his hand, calling out: “Love to Madam Mina; I
U||   shall write so soon as ever I can.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   26 September.—Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week
U||   since I said “Finis,” and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather
U||   going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to
U||   think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
U||   he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he
U||   had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any
U||   trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from
U||   it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is
U||   with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well
U||   of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that
U||   Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
U||   them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my
U||   work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might
U||   fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming
U||   cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
U||   end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,
U||   too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He
U||   went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came
U||   back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock,
U||   and thrust last night’s “Westminster Gazette” into my hand.
U||   “What do you think of that?” he asked as he stood back and folded his
U||   arms.
U||   I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but
U||   he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being
U||   decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I
U||   reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their
U||   throats. An idea struck me, and I looked up. “Well?” he said.
U||   “It is like poor Lucy’s.”
U||   “And what do you make of it?”
U||   “Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that
U||   injured her has injured them.” I did not quite understand his answer:—
U||   “That is true indirectly, but not directly.”
U||   “How do you mean, Professor?” I asked. I was a little inclined to take
U||   his seriousness lightly—for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
U||   from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits—but
U||   when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our
U||   despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.
U||   “Tell me!” I said. “I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
U||   think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.”
U||   “Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to
U||   what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
U||   events, but by me?”
U||   “Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.”
U||   “And how the blood lost or waste?” I shook my head. He stepped over and
U||   sat down beside me, and went on:—
U||   “You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is
U||   bold; but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your
U||   ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account
U||   to you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot
U||   understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others
U||   cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate
U||   by men’s eyes, because they know—or think they know—some things which
U||   other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it
U||   wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is
U||   nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of
U||   new beliefs, which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old,
U||   which pretend to be young—like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose
U||   now you do not believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in
U||   materialisation. No? Nor in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of
U||   thought. No? Nor in hypnotism——”
U||   “Yes,” I said. “Charcot has proved that pretty well.” He smiled as he
U||   went on: “Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you
U||   understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
U||   Charcot—alas that he is no more!—into the very soul of the patient that
U||   he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply
U||   accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a
U||   blank? No? Then tell me—for I am student of the brain—how you accept
U||   the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my
U||   friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which
U||   would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
U||   electricity—who would themselves not so long before have been burned as
U||   wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that Methuselah
U||   lived nine hundred years, and ‘Old Parr’ one hundred and sixty-nine,
U||   and yet that poor Lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor veins, could
U||   not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we could have
U||   save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do you know
U||   the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
U||   qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me
U||   why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
U||   for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,
U||   till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps?
U||   Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats
U||   that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry
U||   their veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats
U||   which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as
U||   like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck,
U||   because that it is hot, flit down on them, and then—and then in the
U||   morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?”
U||   “Good God, Professor!” I said, starting up. “Do you mean to tell me
U||   that Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in
U||   London in the nineteenth century?” He waved his hand for silence, and
U||   went on:—
U||   “Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
U||   men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and
U||   why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
U||   Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are
U||   some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
U||   women who cannot die? We all know—because science has vouched for the
U||   fact—that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
U||   years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
U||   the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
U||   and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and
U||   the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then
U||   men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian
U||   fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?”
U||   Here I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my
U||   mind his list of nature’s eccentricities and possible impossibilities
U||   that my imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was
U||   teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at
U||   Amsterdam; but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have
U||   the object of thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this
U||   help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said:—
U||   “Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
U||   that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in
U||   my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows
U||   an idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist,
U||   jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on
U||   without knowing where I am going.”
U||   “That is good image,” he said. “Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
U||   this: I want you to believe.”
U||   “To believe what?”
U||   “To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once
U||   of an American who so defined faith: ‘that faculty which enables us to
U||   believe things which we know to be untrue.’ For one, I follow that man.
U||   He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of
U||   truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway
U||   truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value
U||   him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth
U||   in the universe.”
U||   “Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
U||   receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read
U||   your lesson aright?”
U||   “Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now
U||   that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
U||   understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children’s
U||   throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?”
U||   “I suppose so.” He stood up and said solemnly:—
U||   “Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,
U||   far, far worse.”
U||   “In God’s name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?” I cried.
U||   He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his
U||   elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:—
U||   “They were made by Miss Lucy!”
U||CHAPTER XV
U||DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—continued.
U||   FOR a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her
U||   life struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I
U||   said to him:—
U||   “Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?” He raised his head and looked at me,
U||   and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. “Would I
U||   were!” he said. “Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like
U||   this. Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so
U||   long to tell you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have
U||   hated you all my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it
U||   that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my
U||   life, and from a fearful death? Ah no!”
U||   “Forgive me,” said I. He went on:—
U||   “My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to
U||   you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do
U||   not expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
U||   truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
U||   believed the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
U||   concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove
U||   it. Dare you come with me?”
U||   This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron
U||   excepted from the category, jealousy.
U||   “And prove the very truth he most abhorred.”
U||   He saw my hesitation, and spoke:—
U||   “The logic is simple, no madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock
U||   to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be
U||   relief; at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the
U||   dread; yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of
U||   belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and
U||   see that child in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital,
U||   where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of
U||   yours since you were in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists
U||   see his case, if he will not let two friends. We shall tell him
U||   nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then——”
U||   “And then?” He took a key from his pocket and held it up. “And then we
U||   spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is
U||   the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to
U||   Arthur.” My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some
U||   fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up
U||   what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon
U||   was passing....
U||   We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and
U||   altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its
U||   throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the
U||   similarity to those which had been on Lucy’s throat. They were smaller,
U||   and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he
U||   attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some
U||   animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think
U||   that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
U||   heights of London. “Out of so many harmless ones,” he said, “there may
U||   be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some
U||   sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even
U||   from the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be
U||   bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten
U||   days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this
U||   direction. For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red
U||   Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this
U||   ‘bloofer lady’ scare came along, since when it has been quite a
U||   gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up
U||   to-day, asked the nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he
U||   wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”
U||   “I hope,” said Van Helsing, “that when you are sending the child home
U||   you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These
U||   fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain
U||   out another night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I
U||   suppose you will not let it away for some days?”
U||   “Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
U||   healed.”
U||   Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
U||   the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it
U||   was, he said:—
U||   “There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
U||   somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”
U||   We dined at “Jack Straw’s Castle” along with a little crowd of
U||   bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o’clock we
U||   started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
U||   made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
U||   radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for
U||   he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
U||   locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
U||   last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
U||   police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of
U||   the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty—for
U||   it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us—we found
U||   the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
U||   and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to
U||   precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the
U||   courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My
U||   companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
U||   carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,
U||   one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
U||   fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
U||   proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed
U||   with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
U||   days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
U||   turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
U||   beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
U||   stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
U||   brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
U||   candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
U||   imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life—animal life—was
U||   not the only thing which could pass away.
U||   Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so
U||   that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
U||   dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
U||   made assurance of Lucy’s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took
U||   out a turnscrew.
U||   “What are you going to do?” I asked.
U||   “To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.” Straightway he began
U||   taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
U||   casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed
U||   to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
U||   stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took
U||   hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: “You shall see,” and again
U||   fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew
U||   through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
U||   made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
U||   the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We
U||   doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed
U||   to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor
U||   never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one
U||   side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side.
U||   Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot
U||   of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to
U||   me to look.
U||   I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.
U||   It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock,
U||   but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his
U||   ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task. “Are you satisfied
U||   now, friend John?” he asked.
U||   I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as
U||   I answered him:—
U||   “I am satisfied that Lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that only
U||   proves one thing.”
U||   “And what is that, friend John?”
U||   “That it is not there.”
U||   “That is good logic,” he said, “so far as it goes. But how do you—how
U||   can you—account for it not being there?”
U||   “Perhaps a body-snatcher,” I suggested. “Some of the undertaker’s
U||   people may have stolen it.” I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet
U||   it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed.
U||   “Ah well!” he said, “we must have more proof. Come with me.”
U||   He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
U||   them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
U||   bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and
U||   locked it. He handed me the key, saying: “Will you keep it? You had
U||   better be assured.” I laughed—it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am
U||   bound to say—as I motioned him to keep it. “A key is nothing,” I said;
U||   “there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
U||   of that kind.” He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
U||   told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
U||   the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark
U||   figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
U||   sight.
U||   It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a
U||   distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was
U||   chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on
U||   such an errand and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too
U||   sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust
U||   so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.
U||   Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white
U||   streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
U||   farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the
U||   Professor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I
U||   too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I
U||   stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
U||   early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered
U||   juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim
U||   figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden
U||   by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the
U||   rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
U||   coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When
U||   he saw me he held it out to me, and said:—
U||   “Are you satisfied now?”
U||   “No,” I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.
U||   “Do you not see the child?”
U||   “Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?” I
U||   asked.
U||   “We shall see,” said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our
U||   way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.
U||   When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of
U||   trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child’s throat. It was
U||   without a scratch or scar of any kind.
U||   “Was I right?” I asked triumphantly.
U||   “We were just in time,” said the Professor thankfully.
U||   We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so
U||   consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should
U||   have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least,
U||   we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find
U||   the child. So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath,
U||   and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not
U||   fail to find it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we
U||   could. All fell out well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a
U||   policeman’s heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited
U||   and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We
U||   heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently.
U||   By good chance we got a cab near the “Spaniards,” and drove to town.
U||   I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few
U||   hours’ sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that
U||   I shall go with him on another expedition.
U||   27 September.—It was two o’clock before we found a suitable opportunity
U||   for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the
U||   last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when,
U||   looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton
U||   lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till morning
U||   did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want
U||   more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the
U||   reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
U||   place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
U||   incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so
U||   useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a
U||   woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of
U||   folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our
U||   own eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders,
U||   however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his
U||   own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the
U||   vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not
U||   so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when
U||   the sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy’s coffin, and
U||   I followed. He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and
U||   then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.
U||   There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
U||   funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and
U||   I could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder
U||   than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.
U||   “Is this a juggle?” I said to him.
U||   “Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as he
U||   spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled
U||   back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.
U||   “See,” he went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. With this
U||   and this”—and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it—“the
U||   little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend John?”
U||   Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I could not accept
U||   such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to argue
U||   of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:—
U||   “She may have been placed here since last night.”
U||   “Indeed? That is so, and by whom?”
U||   “I do not know. Some one has done it.”
U||   “And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would
U||   not look so.” I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did
U||   not seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin
U||   nor triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman,
U||   raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the
U||   lips and examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:—
U||   “Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
U||   some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire
U||   when she was in a trance, sleep-walking—oh, you start; you do not know
U||   that, friend John, but you shall know it all later—and in trance could
U||   he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she
U||   is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when
U||   the Un-Dead sleep at home”—as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of
U||   his arm to designate what to a vampire was “home”—“their face show what
U||   they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back
U||   to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and
U||   so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.” This turned my
U||   blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van
U||   Helsing’s theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of
U||   terror in the idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently
U||   saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously:—
U||   “Ah, you believe now?”
U||   I answered: “Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to
U||   accept. How will you do this bloody work?”
U||   “I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
U||   drive a stake through her body.” It made me shudder to think of so
U||   mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling
U||   was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
U||   shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing
U||   called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all
U||   subjective, or all objective?
U||   I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as
U||   if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a
U||   snap, and said:—
U||   “I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If
U||   I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what
U||   is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that
U||   are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is
U||   simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act
U||   now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to
U||   want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the
U||   wounds on Lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s
U||   at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
U||   to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
U||   beautiful in a whole week, after she die—if you know of this and know
U||   of the white figure last night that brought the child to the
U||   churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then,
U||   can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He
U||   doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he
U||   has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that
U||   prevent him say good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some
U||   more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive; and that in most
U||   mistake of all we have killed her. He will then argue back that it is
U||   we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be
U||   much unhappy always. Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of
U||   all. And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive,
U||   and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have
U||   suffered; and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his
U||   so beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since
U||   then I learn much. Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand
U||   times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to
U||   reach the sweet. He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the
U||   very face of heaven grow black to him; then we can act for good all
U||   round and send him peace. My mind is made up. Let us go. You return
U||   home for to-night to your asylum, and see that all be well. As for me,
U||   I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way.
U||   To-morrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the
U||   clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young
U||   man of America that gave his blood. Later we shall all have work to do.
U||   I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back
U||   here before the sun set.”
U||   So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
U||   churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.
U||   Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to
U||   John Seward, M. D.
U||   (Not delivered.)
U||   “27 September.
U||   “Friend John,—
U||   “I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
U||   that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not
U||   leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
U||   Therefore I shall fix some things she like not—garlic and a
U||   crucifix—and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,
U||   and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
U||   may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is
U||   desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it
U||   may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the
U||   sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it.
U||   For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is
U||   there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and
U||   find shelter. He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the
U||   way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss
U||   Lucy’s life, and we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He
U||   have always the strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who
U||   gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can
U||   summon his wolf and I know not what. So if it be that he come thither
U||   on this night he shall find me; but none other shall—until it be too
U||   late. But it may be that he will not attempt the place. There is no
U||   reason why he should; his hunting ground is more full of game than the
U||   churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.
U||   “Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,
U||   the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
U||   great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake
U||   through it, so that the world may rest from him.
U||   “If it be so, farewell.
U||   “Van Helsing.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   28 September.—It is wonderful what a good night’s sleep will do for
U||   one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing’s monstrous
U||   ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on
U||   common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his
U||   mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be some
U||   rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible
U||   that the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever
U||   that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard
U||   to some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and
U||   indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that
U||   Van Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get
U||   some light on the mystery.
U||   29 September, morning..... Last night, at a little before ten o’clock,
U||   Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing’s room; he told us all that he
U||   wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all
U||   our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we
U||   would all come with him too, “for,” he said, “there is a grave duty to
U||   be done there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?” This query
U||   was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.
U||   “I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
U||   around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been
U||   curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but
U||   the more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for
U||   myself that I’m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.”
U||   “Me too,” said Quincey Morris laconically.
U||   “Oh,” said the Professor, “then you are nearer the beginning, both of
U||   you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can
U||   even get so far as to begin.”
U||   It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
U||   mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said
U||   with intense gravity:—
U||   “I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I
U||   know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you
U||   will know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you
U||   promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry
U||   with me for a time—I must not disguise from myself the possibility that
U||   such may be—you shall not blame yourselves for anything.”
U||   “That’s frank anyhow,” broke in Quincey. “I’ll answer for the
U||   Professor. I don’t quite see his drift, but I swear he’s honest; and
U||   that’s good enough for me.”
U||   “I thank you, sir,” said Van Helsing proudly. “I have done myself the
U||   honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is
U||   dear to me.” He held out a hand, which Quincey took.
U||   Then Arthur spoke out:—
U||   “Dr. Van Helsing, I don’t quite like to ‘buy a pig in a poke,’ as they
U||   say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a
U||   gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a
U||   promise. If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate
U||   either of these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the
U||   life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at.”
U||   “I accept your limitation,” said Van Helsing, “and all I ask of you is
U||   that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will
U||   first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
U||   reservations.”
U||   “Agreed!” said Arthur; “that is only fair. And now that the pourparlers
U||   are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?”
U||   “I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard
U||   at Kingstead.”
U||   Arthur’s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:—
U||   “Where poor Lucy is buried?” The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: “And
U||   when there?”
U||   “To enter the tomb!” Arthur stood up.
U||   “Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon
U||   me, I see that you are in earnest.” He sat down again, but I could see
U||   that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
U||   silence until he asked again:—
U||   “And when in the tomb?”
U||   “To open the coffin.”
U||   “This is too much!” he said, angrily rising again. “I am willing to be
U||   patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this—this desecration
U||   of the grave—of one who——” He fairly choked with indignation. The
U||   Professor looked pityingly at him.
U||   “If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,” he said, “God knows I
U||   would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later,
U||   and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!”
U||   Arthur looked up with set white face and said:—
U||   “Take care, sir, take care!”
U||   “Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?” said Van Helsing.
U||   “And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go
U||   on?”
U||   “That’s fair enough,” broke in Morris.
U||   After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:—
U||   “Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to
U||   her. But if she be not dead——”
U||   Arthur jumped to his feet.
U||   “Good God!” he cried. “What do you mean? Has there been any mistake;
U||   has she been buried alive?” He groaned in anguish that not even hope
U||   could soften.
U||   “I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
U||   further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.”
U||   “Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what
U||   is it?”
U||   “There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
U||   may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But
U||   I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?”
U||   “Heavens and earth, no!” cried Arthur in a storm of passion. “Not for
U||   the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.
U||   Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you
U||   should torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should
U||   want to cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such
U||   things, or am I mad to listen to them? Don’t dare to think more of such
U||   a desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a
U||   duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall
U||   do it!”
U||   Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and
U||   said, gravely and sternly:—
U||   “My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty
U||   to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you
U||   now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
U||   later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
U||   fulfilment even than I am, then—then I shall do my duty, whatever it
U||   may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship’s wishes I shall
U||   hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and
U||   where you will.” His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice
U||   full of pity:—
U||   “But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life
U||   of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did
U||   wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me
U||   that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look
U||   from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man
U||   can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself
U||   so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own
U||   land to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John,
U||   and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For
U||   her—I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness—I gave what
U||   you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you,
U||   her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my
U||   nights and days—before death, after death; and if my death can do her
U||   good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.”
U||   He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much
U||   affected by it. He took the old man’s hand and said in a broken voice:—
U||   “Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I
U||   shall go with you and wait.”
U||CHAPTER XVI
U||DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—continued
U||   IT was just a quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the
U||   churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams
U||   of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
U||   the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly
U||   in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked
U||   well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with
U||   so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took
U||   it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a
U||   counteractant to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing
U||   a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the
U||   difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he
U||   closed the door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin.
U||   Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:—
U||   “You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
U||   coffin?”
U||   “It was.” The Professor turned to the rest saying:—
U||   “You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.” He
U||   took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur
U||   looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped
U||   forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,
U||   at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,
U||   the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
U||   again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.
U||   Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
U||   recoiled.
U||   The coffin was empty!
U||   For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by
U||   Quincey Morris:—
U||   “Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn’t ask
U||   such a thing ordinarily—I wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply a
U||   doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
U||   Is this your doing?”
U||   “I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
U||   touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward
U||   and I came here—with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin,
U||   which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then
U||   waited, and saw something white come through the trees. The next day we
U||   came here in day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?”
U||   “Yes.”
U||   “That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,
U||   and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I
U||   came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited
U||   here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most
U||   probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors
U||   garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they
U||   shun. Last night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I
U||   took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin
U||   empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you
U||   with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet
U||   to be. So”—here he shut the dark slide of his lantern—“now to the
U||   outside.” He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and
U||   locking the door behind him.
U||   Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
U||   that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
U||   gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
U||   passing—like the gladness and sorrow of a man’s life; how sweet it was
U||   to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how
U||   humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
U||   hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city.
U||   Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and
U||   was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning
U||   of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again
U||   to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing’s conclusions. Quincey
U||   Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
U||   accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has
U||   to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of
U||   tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a
U||   definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like
U||   thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white
U||   napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
U||   dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
U||   mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin
U||   strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
U||   setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
U||   asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near
U||   also, as they too were curious. He answered:—
U||   “I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.”
U||   “And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked Quincey.
U||   “Great Scott! Is this a game?”
U||   “It is.”
U||   “What is that which you are using?” This time the question was by
U||   Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:—
U||   “The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.” It was
U||   an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt
U||   individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the
U||   Professor’s, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of
U||   things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took
U||   the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the
U||   sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I
U||   had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching
U||   horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs,
U||   felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white;
U||   never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of
U||   funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously;
U||   never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away
U||   howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.
U||   There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from
U||   the Professor a keen “S-s-s-s!” He pointed; and far down the avenue of
U||   yews we saw a white figure advance—a dim white figure, which held
U||   something dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a
U||   ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in
U||   startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of
U||   the grave. We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we
U||   saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little
U||   cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the
U||   fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the Professor’s warning
U||   hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then
U||   as we looked the white figure moved forwards again. It was now near
U||   enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own
U||   heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we
U||   recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how
U||   changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and
U||   the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and,
U||   obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in
U||   a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and
U||   drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy’s face we
U||   could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the
U||   stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn
U||   death-robe.
U||   We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even
U||   Van Helsing’s iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I
U||   had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.
U||   When Lucy—I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her
U||   shape—saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives
U||   when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy’s eyes in form
U||   and colour; but Lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
U||   the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
U||   passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have
U||   done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
U||   light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,
U||   how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to
U||   the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had
U||   clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
U||   over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There
U||   was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when
U||   she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell
U||   back and hid his face in his hands.
U||   She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
U||   said:—
U||   “Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are
U||   hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband,
U||   come!”
U||   There was something diabolically sweet in her tones—something of the
U||   tingling of glass when struck—which rang through the brains even of us
U||   who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed
U||   under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms.
U||   She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held
U||   between them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and,
U||   with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to
U||   enter the tomb.
U||   When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
U||   arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
U||   shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
U||   quiver from Van Helsing’s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled
U||   malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by
U||   mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to
U||   throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the
U||   folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa’s snakes, and the lovely,
U||   blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
U||   the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death—if looks could
U||   kill—we saw it at that moment.
U||   And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
U||   between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
U||   entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:—
U||   “Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?”
U||   Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
U||   answered:—
U||   “Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like
U||   this ever any more;” and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
U||   simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the
U||   click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close
U||   to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
U||   emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified
U||   amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
U||   body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
U||   where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of
U||   relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
U||   to the edges of the door.
U||   When this was done, he lifted the child and said:
U||   “Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a
U||   funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The
U||   friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
U||   the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this
U||   of to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by
U||   to-morrow night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police
U||   will find him, as on the other night; and then to home.” Coming close
U||   to Arthur, he said:—
U||   “My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look
U||   back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter
U||   waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have
U||   passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
U||   overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.”
U||   Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
U||   on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
U||   slept with more or less reality of sleep.
U||   29 September, night.—A little before twelve o’clock we three—Arthur,
U||   Quincey Morris, and myself—called for the Professor. It was odd to
U||   notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of
U||   course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of
U||   us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and
U||   strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
U||   gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
U||   that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
U||   ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
U||   long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
U||   fair weight.
U||   When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
U||   the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
U||   Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
U||   behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and
U||   also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their
U||   own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to
U||   work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy’s coffin we all
U||   looked—Arthur trembling like an aspen—and saw that the body lay there
U||   in all its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing
U||   but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy’s shape without
U||   her soul. I could see even Arthur’s face grow hard as he looked.
U||   Presently he said to Van Helsing:—
U||   “Is this really Lucy’s body, or only a demon in her shape?”
U||   “It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her
U||   as she was, and is.”
U||   She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed
U||   teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth—which it made one shudder to
U||   see—the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
U||   devilish mockery of Lucy’s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual
U||   methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
U||   placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some
U||   plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
U||   a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue
U||   flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a
U||   round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about
U||   three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire,
U||   and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer,
U||   such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the
U||   lumps. To me, a doctor’s preparations for work of any kind are
U||   stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur
U||   and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both,
U||   however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.
U||   When all was ready, Van Helsing said:—
U||   “Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and
U||   experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
U||   of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the
U||   curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
U||   adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
U||   die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and
U||   prey on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as
U||   the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had
U||   met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last
U||   night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had
U||   died, have become nosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and
U||   would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with
U||   horror. The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.
U||   Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse;
U||   but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by
U||   her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with
U||   that so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
U||   wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
U||   unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
U||   this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the
U||   poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working
U||   wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it
U||   by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my
U||   friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow
U||   that sets her free. To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us
U||   who has a better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the
U||   silence of the night when sleep is not: ‘It was my hand that sent her
U||   to the stars; it was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that
U||   of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’
U||   Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?”
U||   We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
U||   kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would
U||   restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped
U||   forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as
U||   pale as snow:—
U||   “My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell
U||   me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!” Van Helsing laid a hand on
U||   his shoulder, and said:—
U||   “Brave lad! A moment’s courage, and it is done. This stake must be
U||   driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal—be not deceived in
U||   that—but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
U||   than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
U||   you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun.
U||   Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray
U||   for you all the time.”
U||   “Go on,” said Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me what I am to do.”
U||   “Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
U||   heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for
U||   the dead—I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall
U||   follow—strike in God’s name, that so all may be well with the dead that
U||   we love and that the Un-Dead pass away.”
U||   Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
U||   action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened
U||   his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we
U||   could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could
U||   see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.
U||   The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech
U||   came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted
U||   in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
U||   lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But
U||   Arthur never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his
U||   untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the
U||   mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and
U||   spurted up around it. His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine
U||   through it; the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed
U||   to ring through the little vault.
U||   And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
U||   teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still.
U||   The terrible task was over.
U||   The hammer fell from Arthur’s hand. He reeled and would have fallen had
U||   we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
U||   and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain
U||   on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human
U||   considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few
U||   minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
U||   coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from
U||   one to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he
U||   had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a
U||   glad, strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the
U||   gloom of horror that lay upon it.
U||   There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so
U||   dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded
U||   as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen
U||   her in her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True
U||   that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care
U||   and pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her
U||   truth to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay
U||   like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token
U||   and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.
U||   Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur’s shoulder, and said to
U||   him:—
U||   “And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?”
U||   The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man’s hand
U||   in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:—
U||   “Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul
U||   again, and me peace.” He put his hands on the Professor’s shoulder, and
U||   laying his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we
U||   stood unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:—
U||   “And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will,
U||   as she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a
U||   grinning devil now—not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No
U||   longer she is the devil’s Un-Dead. She is God’s true dead, whose soul
U||   is with Him!”
U||   Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the
U||   tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the
U||   point of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth
U||   with garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the
U||   coffin-lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the
U||   Professor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur.
U||   Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
U||   seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
U||   gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
U||   on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.
U||   Before we moved away Van Helsing said:—
U||   “Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
U||   to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author
U||   of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can
U||   follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in
U||   it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe,
U||   all of us—is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And
U||   do we not promise to go on to the bitter end?”
U||   Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the
U||   Professor as we moved off:—
U||   “Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of
U||   the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you
U||   know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our
U||   plans unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to
U||   consult about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but
U||   shall return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But
U||   first I shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and
U||   to dread. Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there
U||   is a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare
U||   we must not draw back.”
U||CHAPTER XVII
U||DR. SEWARD’S DIARY—continued
U||   WHEN we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
U||   waiting for him:—
U||   “Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.—Mina
U||   Harker.”
U||   The Professor was delighted. “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,” he said,
U||   “pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your
U||   house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her en
U||   route, so that she may be prepared.”
U||   When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of
U||   a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten
U||   copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker’s diary at Whitby. “Take these,” he
U||   said, “and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of
U||   all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep
U||   them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all
U||   your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day.
U||   What is here told,” he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet
U||   of papers as he spoke, “may be the beginning of the end to you and me
U||   and many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the
U||   earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
U||   any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have
U||   kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we
U||   shall go through all these together when we meet.” He then made ready
U||   for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I
U||   took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before
U||   the train came in.
U||   The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
U||   platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my
U||   guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
U||   after a quick glance, said: “Dr. Seward, is it not?”
U||   “And you are Mrs. Harker!” I answered at once; whereupon she held out
U||   her hand.
U||   “I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but——” She stopped
U||   suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.
U||   The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for
U||   it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a
U||   typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I
U||   had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom
U||   prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.
U||   In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a
U||   lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a
U||   shudder when we entered.
U||   She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study,
U||   as she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my
U||   phonograph diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance
U||   of looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they
U||   lie open before me. I must get her interested in something, so that I
U||   may have an opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious
U||   time is, or what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to
U||   frighten her. Here she is!
U||   Mina Harker’s Journal.
U||   29 September.—After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward’s
U||   study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking
U||   with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
U||   the door, and on his calling out, “Come in,” I entered.
U||   To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
U||   and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the
U||   description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much
U||   interested.
U||   “I hope I did not keep you waiting,” I said; “but I stayed at the door
U||   as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.”
U||   “Oh,” he replied with a smile, “I was only entering my diary.”
U||   “Your diary?” I asked him in surprise.
U||   “Yes,” he answered. “I keep it in this.” As he spoke he laid his hand
U||   on the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:—
U||   “Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?”
U||   “Certainly,” he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
U||   for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.
U||   “The fact is,” he began awkwardly, “I only keep my diary in it; and as
U||   it is entirely—almost entirely—about my cases, it may be awkward—that
U||   is, I mean——” He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his
U||   embarrassment:—
U||   “You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;
U||   for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very,
U||   very dear to me.”
U||   To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:—
U||   “Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!”
U||   “Why not?” I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over
U||   me. Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an
U||   excuse. At length he stammered out:—
U||   “You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
U||   diary.” Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said
U||   with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté
U||   of a child: “That’s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!” I could
U||   not but smile, at which he grimaced. “I gave myself away that time!” he
U||   said. “But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months
U||   past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular
U||   part of it in case I wanted to look it up?” By this time my mind was
U||   made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have
U||   something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being,
U||   and I said boldly:—
U||   “Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my
U||   typewriter.” He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:—
U||   “No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn’t let you know that terrible
U||   story!”
U||   Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,
U||   and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
U||   some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on
U||   the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
U||   followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my
U||   meaning.
U||   “You do not know me,” I said. “When you have read those papers—my own
U||   diary and my husband’s also, which I have typed—you will know me
U||   better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
U||   this cause; but, of course, you do not know me—yet; and I must not
U||   expect you to trust me so far.”
U||   He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about
U||   him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in
U||   order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
U||   said:—
U||   “You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.
U||   But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long
U||   ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I
U||   make the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear
U||   them—the first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not
U||   horrify you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be
U||   ready. In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and
U||   shall be better able to understand certain things.” He carried the
U||   phonograph himself up to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I
U||   shall learn something pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the
U||   other side of a true love episode of which I know one side already....
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   29 September.—I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan
U||   Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without
U||   thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce
U||   dinner, so I said: “She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,”
U||   and I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker’s diary,
U||   when she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes
U||   were flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have
U||   had cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me;
U||   and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears,
U||   went straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:—
U||   “I greatly fear I have distressed you.”
U||   “Oh, no, not distressed me,” she replied, “but I have been more touched
U||   than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is
U||   cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
U||   It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them
U||   spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out
U||   the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart
U||   beat, as I did.”
U||   “No one need ever know, shall ever know,” I said in a low voice. She
U||   laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:—
U||   “Ah, but they must!”
U||   “Must! But why?” I asked.
U||   “Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy’s
U||   death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
U||   before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
U||   the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the
U||   cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to
U||   know; but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this
U||   dark mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a
U||   certain point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7
U||   September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being
U||   wrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since
U||   Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more
U||   information, and he will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no
U||   secrets amongst us; working together and with absolute trust, we can
U||   surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark.” She looked at
U||   me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested such courage and
U||   resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes. “You
U||   shall,” I said, “do as you like in the matter. God forgive me if I do
U||   wrong! There are terrible things yet to learn of; but if you have so
U||   far travelled on the road to poor Lucy’s death, you will not be
U||   content, I know, to remain in the dark. Nay, the end—the very end—may
U||   give you a gleam of peace. Come, there is dinner. We must keep one
U||   another strong for what is before us; we have a cruel and dreadful
U||   task. When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and I shall answer
U||   any questions you ask—if there be anything which you do not understand,
U||   though it was apparent to us who were present.”
U||   Mina Harker’s Journal.
U||   29 September.—After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He
U||   brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He
U||   placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I
U||   could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case
U||   I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with
U||   his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to
U||   read. I put the forked metal to my ears and listened.
U||   When the terrible story of Lucy’s death, and—and all that followed, was
U||   done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a
U||   fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a
U||   horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a
U||   cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored
U||   me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all
U||   the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy
U||   was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without
U||   making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if
U||   I had not known Jonathan’s experience in Transylvania I could not have
U||   believed. As it was, I didn’t know what to believe, and so got out of
U||   my difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my
U||   typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:—
U||   “Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing
U||   when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when
U||   he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,
U||   and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
U||   put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that
U||   Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell
U||   him when they come.” He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace,
U||   and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I
U||   used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had
U||   done with all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward
U||   went about his work of going his round of the patients; when he had
U||   finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel
U||   too lonely whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world
U||   seems full of good men—even if there are monsters in it. Before I left
U||   him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor’s
U||   perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
U||   Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the
U||   files of “The Westminster Gazette” and “The Pall Mall Gazette,” and
U||   took them to my room. I remember how much “The Dailygraph” and “The
U||   Whitby Gazette,” of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand
U||   the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall
U||   look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get
U||   some new light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me
U||   quiet.
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   30 September.—Mr. Harker arrived at nine o’clock. He had got his wife’s
U||   wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge
U||   from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true—and judging
U||   by one’s own wonderful experiences, it must be—he is also a man of
U||   great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a
U||   remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was
U||   prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
U||   business-like gentleman who came here to-day.
U||   Later.—After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, and
U||   as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They are
U||   hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
U||   chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got
U||   the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
U||   carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his
U||   wife’s typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here
U||   it is....
U||   Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the
U||   Count’s hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues from the
U||   conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating to the
U||   purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh, if we had only had
U||   them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy! Stop; that way madness
U||   lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collating his material. He
U||   says that by dinner-time they will be able to show a whole connected
U||   narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield, as
U||   hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the
U||   Count. I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the dates I suppose I
U||   shall. What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type!
U||   We never could have found the dates otherwise....
U||   I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded,
U||   smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever
U||   saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which
U||   he treated naturally. He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home,
U||   a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn
U||   here. In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at
U||   once. I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker and read the
U||   letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to
U||   sign for him after a brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly
U||   suspicious. All those outbreaks were in some way linked with the
U||   proximity of the Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can
U||   it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate
U||   triumph? Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings
U||   outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of
U||   “master.” This all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a
U||   while I came away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to
U||   make it safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to
U||   think, and then—! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his;
U||   so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to
U||   have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.
U||   Jonathan Harker’s Journal.
U||   29 September, in train to London.—When I received Mr. Billington’s
U||   courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I
U||   thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such
U||   inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
U||   of the Count’s to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal
U||   with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
U||   brought me to his father’s house, where they had decided that I must
U||   stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:
U||   give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all
U||   knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington
U||   had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of
U||   boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I
U||   had seen on the Count’s table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
U||   Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
U||   with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle
U||   which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being
U||   carried out. To use an Americanism, he had “taken no chances,” and the
U||   absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was
U||   simply the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note
U||   of it: “Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental
U||   purposes.” Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply;
U||   of both of these I got copies. This was all the information Mr.
U||   Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the
U||   coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. They had all
U||   something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already
U||   taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple
U||   description “Fifty cases of common earth.” I then saw the
U||   station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had
U||   actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and
U||   they had nothing to add except that the boxes were “main and mortal
U||   heavy,” and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it
U||   was hard lines that there wasn’t any gentleman “such-like as yourself,
U||   squire,” to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid
U||   form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such
U||   that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it.
U||   Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and
U||   adequately, this source of reproach.
U||   30 September.—The station-master was good enough to give me a line to
U||   his old companion the station-master at King’s Cross, so that when I
U||   arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of
U||   the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper
U||   officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original
U||   invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been
U||   here limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I
U||   was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner.
U||   From thence I went on to Carter Paterson’s central office, where I met
U||   with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their
U||   day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King’s Cross
U||   office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming
U||   were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
U||   also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
U||   delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing
U||   exactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of the
U||   written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found,
U||   connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the
U||   consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an
U||   opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the
U||   allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men
U||   remarked:—
U||   “That ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it
U||   ain’t been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in
U||   the place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’ of yer bones;
U||   an’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave smelled ole
U||   Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel—that took the cike, that did! Me
U||   and my mate, we thort we wouldn’t never git out quick enough. Lor’, I
U||   wouldn’t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark.”
U||   Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what
U||   I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.
U||   Of one thing I am now satisfied: that all the boxes which arrived at
U||   Whitby from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old
U||   chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have
U||   since been removed—as from Dr. Seward’s diary I fear.
U||   I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when
U||   Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good
U||   deal.
U||   Later.—Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers
U||   into order.
U||   Mina Harker’s Journal
U||   30 September.—I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It
U||   is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:
U||   that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
U||   detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a
U||   face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
U||   however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong,
U||   never so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that
U||   dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves
U||   under strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life
U||   and hope and determination; we have got everything in order for
U||   to-night. I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought
U||   to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this
U||   Thing is not human—not even beast. To read Dr. Seward’s account of poor
U||   Lucy’s death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of
U||   pity in one’s heart.
U||   Later.—Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected.
U||   Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I
U||   had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back
U||   all poor dear Lucy’s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had
U||   heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, has
U||   been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor
U||   fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals
U||   they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to say or do, as they
U||   were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on
U||   neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and came to the
U||   conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in
U||   affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward’s diary that they had
U||   been at Lucy’s death—her real death—and that I need not fear to betray
U||   any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I could, that I
U||   had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having
U||   typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order. I gave them
U||   each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got his and
U||   turned it over—it does make a pretty good pile—he said:—
U||   “Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?”
U||   I nodded, and he went on:—
U||   “I don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
U||   kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
U||   I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have
U||   had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble
U||   to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy—”
U||   Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear
U||   the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just
U||   laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out
U||   of the room. I suppose there is something in woman’s nature that makes
U||   a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the
U||   tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood;
U||   for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the
U||   sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took
U||   his hand. I hope he didn’t think it forward of me, and that if he ever
U||   thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I
U||   wrong him; I know he never will—he is too true a gentleman. I said to
U||   him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:—
U||   “I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were
U||   to her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not
U||   let me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you
U||   have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and
U||   pity can help in your affliction, won’t you let me be of some little
U||   service—for Lucy’s sake?”
U||   In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It
U||   seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence
U||   found a vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open
U||   hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up
U||   and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt
U||   an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob
U||   he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst
U||   he shook with emotion.
U||   We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
U||   smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big
U||   sorrowing man’s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
U||   that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he
U||   were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.
U||   After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
U||   apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for
U||   days and nights past—weary days and sleepless nights—he had been unable
U||   to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There
U||   was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing
U||   to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he
U||   could speak freely. “I know now how I suffered,” he said, as he dried
U||   his eyes, “but I do not know even yet—and none other can ever know—how
U||   much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall know better in
U||   time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude
U||   will grow with my understanding. You will let me be like a brother,
U||   will you not, for all our lives—for dear Lucy’s sake?”
U||   “For dear Lucy’s sake,” I said as we clasped hands. “Ay, and for your
U||   own sake,” he added, “for if a man’s esteem and gratitude are ever
U||   worth the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should
U||   bring to you a time when you need a man’s help, believe me, you will
U||   not call in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to
U||   break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me
U||   that you will let me know.” He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so
U||   fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:—
U||   “I promise.”
U||   As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.
U||   He turned as he heard my footsteps. “How is Art?” he said. Then
U||   noticing my red eyes, he went on: “Ah, I see you have been comforting
U||   him. Poor old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man
U||   when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him.”
U||   He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw
U||   the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would
U||   realise how much I knew; so I said to him:—
U||   “I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me
U||   be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You
U||   will know, later on, why I speak.” He saw that I was in earnest, and
U||   stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It
U||   seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and
U||   impulsively I bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and
U||   there was a momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:—
U||   “Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
U||   as ever you live!” Then he went into the study to his friend.
U||   “Little girl!”—the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he
U||   proved himself a friend!
U||CHAPTER XVIII
U||DR. SEWARD’S DIARY
U||   30 September.—I got home at five o’clock, and found that Godalming and
U||   Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript of
U||   the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife had
U||   made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
U||   carriers’ men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker
U||   gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time
U||   since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like home. When we had
U||   finished, Mrs. Harker said:—
U||   “Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.
U||   Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary
U||   interests me so much!” She looked so appealing and so pretty that I
U||   could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so
U||   I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
U||   lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: “Why?”
U||   “She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” I
U||   answered. “Oh, very well,” he said; “let her come in, by all means; but
U||   just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.” His method of tidying was
U||   peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
U||   before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was
U||   jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
U||   task, he said cheerfully: “Let the lady come in,” and sat down on the
U||   edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
U||   he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might
U||   have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just
U||   before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I
U||   could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She
U||   came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once
U||   command the respect of any lunatic—for easiness is one of the qualities
U||   mad people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly,
U||   and held out her hand.
U||   “Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,” said she. “You see, I know you, for Dr.
U||   Seward has told me of you.” He made no immediate reply, but eyed her
U||   all over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to
U||   one of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment,
U||   he said:—
U||   “You’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can’t be,
U||   you know, for she’s dead.” Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:—
U||   “Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
U||   saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.”
U||   “Then what are you doing here?”
U||   “My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.”
U||   “Then don’t stay.”
U||   “But why not?” I thought that this style of conversation might not be
U||   pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:—
U||   “How did you know I wanted to marry any one?” His reply was simply
U||   contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
U||   Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:—
U||   “What an asinine question!”
U||   “I don’t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,” said Mrs. Harker, at once
U||   championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
U||   he had shown contempt to me:—
U||   “You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so
U||   loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
U||   interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
U||   household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
U||   them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
U||   effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I
U||   cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
U||   lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi.” I
U||   positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet
U||   lunatic—the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met
U||   with—talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished
U||   gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker’s presence which had touched
U||   some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
U||   way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
U||   power.
U||   We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly
U||   quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she
U||   began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for
U||   he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
U||   completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
U||   certain things.
U||   “Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief.
U||   Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on
U||   my being put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive
U||   and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things,
U||   no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely
U||   prolong life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually
U||   tried to take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one
U||   occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital
U||   powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the
U||   medium of his blood—relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase,
U||   ‘For the blood is the life.’ Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain
U||   nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn’t
U||   that true, doctor?” I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly
U||   knew what to either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had
U||   seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking
U||   at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing,
U||   so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once,
U||   after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: “Good-bye, and I hope I may
U||   see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my
U||   astonishment, he replied:—
U||   “Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
U||   May He bless and keep you!”
U||   When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind
U||   me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first
U||   took ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been
U||   for many a long day.
U||   Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
U||   boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:—
U||   “Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
U||   here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have
U||   much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
U||   Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!”
U||   As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my
U||   own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker’s suggestion;
U||   at which the Professor interrupted me:—
U||   “Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man’s brain—a brain that a man
U||   should have were he much gifted—and a woman’s heart. The good God
U||   fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
U||   combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
U||   to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
U||   affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are
U||   determined—nay, are we not pledged?—to destroy this monster; but it is
U||   no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
U||   in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer—both in
U||   waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,
U||   she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things
U||   to think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then
U||   she must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work,
U||   and we go alone.” I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what
U||   we had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought
U||   was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern
U||   seemed to come on him. “Oh that we had known it before!” he said, “for
U||   then we might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the
U||   milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. We shall not
U||   think of that, but go on our way to the end.” Then he fell into a
U||   silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to
U||   prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:—
U||   “I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband
U||   have put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this
U||   moment.”
U||   “Not up to this moment, Professor,” she said impulsively, “but up to
U||   this morning.”
U||   “But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the
U||   little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who
U||   has told is the worse for it.”
U||   Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she
U||   said:—
U||   “Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It
U||   is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at
U||   present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
U||   what is personal. Must it go in?” The Professor read it over gravely,
U||   and handed it back, saying:—
U||   “It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It
U||   can but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends,
U||   more honour you—as well as more esteem and love.” She took it back with
U||   another blush and a bright smile.
U||   And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
U||   and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
U||   and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. The rest of us
U||   have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
U||   be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
U||   terrible and mysterious enemy.
U||   Mina Harker’s Journal.
U||   30 September.—When we met in Dr. Seward’s study two hours after dinner,
U||   which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of board
U||   or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to
U||   which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit
U||   next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan
U||   sat next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.
U||   Morris—Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
U||   centre. The Professor said:—
U||   “I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
U||   that are in these papers.” We all expressed assent, and he went on:—
U||   “Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of
U||   enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
U||   something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for
U||   me. So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
U||   according.
U||   “There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
U||   exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
U||   teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
U||   peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that
U||   through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could
U||   not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘See!
U||   see! I prove; I prove.’ Alas! Had I known at the first what now I
U||   know—nay, had I even guess at him—one so precious life had been spared
U||   to many of us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work,
U||   that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The nosferatu do
U||   not die like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being
U||   stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is
U||   amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of
U||   cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he
U||   have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply,
U||   the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to
U||   are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil
U||   in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations,
U||   appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to
U||   him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog,
U||   the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the
U||   owl, and the bat—the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and
U||   become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are
U||   we to begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and
U||   having found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a
U||   terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make
U||   the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win;
U||   and then where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail
U||   here, is not mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we
U||   henceforward become foul things of the night like him—without heart or
U||   conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best.
U||   To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to
U||   us again? We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of
U||   God’s sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we
U||   are face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I
U||   say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair
U||   places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You
U||   others are young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in
U||   store. What say you?”
U||   Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so
U||   much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I
U||   saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch—so
U||   strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man’s hand can speak for
U||   itself; it does not even need a woman’s love to hear its music.
U||   When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and
U||   I in his; there was no need for speaking between us.
U||   “I answer for Mina and myself,” he said.
U||   “Count me in, Professor,” said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as
U||   usual.
U||   “I am with you,” said Lord Godalming, “for Lucy’s sake, if for no other
U||   reason.”
U||   Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his
U||   golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
U||   his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right
U||   with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took
U||   hands our solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did
U||   not even occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van
U||   Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the
U||   serious work had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as
U||   businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life:—
U||   “Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
U||   without strength. We have on our side power of combination—a power
U||   denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
U||   act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
U||   In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
U||   free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to
U||   achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.
U||   “Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
U||   restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
U||   limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.
U||   “All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not
U||   at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death—nay
U||   of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the
U||   first place because we have to be—no other means is at our control—and
U||   secondly, because, after all, these things—tradition and
U||   superstition—are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
U||   others—though not, alas! for us—on them? A year ago which of us would
U||   have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
U||   sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief
U||   that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the
U||   vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
U||   moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere
U||   that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany
U||   all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so
U||   far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
U||   this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the
U||   devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we
U||   have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the
U||   beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
U||   experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
U||   time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the
U||   living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
U||   younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
U||   they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he
U||   cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend
U||   Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat,
U||   never! He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again
U||   Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand—witness again
U||   Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him
U||   from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
U||   from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be
U||   as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend
U||   John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw
U||   him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he
U||   create—that noble ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we
U||   know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be
U||   round himself. He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust—as again
U||   Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so
U||   small—we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a
U||   hairbreadth space at the tomb door. He can, when once he find his way,
U||   come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be
U||   bound or even fused up with fire—solder you call it. He can see in the
U||   dark—no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the
U||   light. Ah, but hear me through. He can do all these things, yet he is
U||   not free. Nay; he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley,
U||   than the madman in his cell. He cannot go where he lists; he who is not
U||   of nature has yet to obey some of nature’s laws—why we know not. He may
U||   not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the
U||   household who bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he
U||   please. His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the
U||   coming of the day. Only at certain times can he have limited freedom.
U||   If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change
U||   himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we
U||   told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference. Thus,
U||   whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his
U||   earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we
U||   saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby; still at other
U||   time he can only change when the time come. It is said, too, that he
U||   can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then
U||   there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the
U||   garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my
U||   crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is
U||   nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent
U||   with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in
U||   our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his coffin
U||   keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the
U||   coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through
U||   him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth
U||   rest. We have seen it with our eyes.
U||   “Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
U||   him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is
U||   clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to
U||   make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what
U||   he has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won
U||   his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
U||   Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,
U||   and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
U||   cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond the
U||   forest.’ That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to
U||   his grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says
U||   Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
U||   were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They
U||   learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake
U||   Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In
U||   the records are such words as ‘stregoica’—witch, ‘ordog,’ and
U||   ‘pokol’—Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is
U||   spoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. There have
U||   been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and
U||   their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell.
U||   For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted
U||   deep in all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”
U||   Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,
U||   and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little
U||   pause, and then the Professor went on:—
U||   “And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must
U||   proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan
U||   that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
U||   were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these
U||   boxes have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be
U||   to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
U||   where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
U||   latter, we must trace——”
U||   Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house
U||   came the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered
U||   with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure,
U||   struck the far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward,
U||   for I shrieked out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming
U||   flew over to the window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard
U||   Mr. Morris’s voice without:—
U||   “Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about
U||   it.” A minute later he came in and said:—
U||   “It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
U||   Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But
U||   the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat
U||   and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned
U||   brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to
U||   have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have
U||   seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.”
U||   “Did you hit it?” asked Dr. Van Helsing.
U||   “I don’t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” Without
U||   saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his
U||   statement:—
U||   “We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
U||   either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
U||   speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
U||   Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
U||   noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.
U||   “And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
U||   You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night,
U||   you no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are
U||   men and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
U||   shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
U||   are.”
U||   All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
U||   good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
U||   safety—strength being the best safety—through care of me; but their
U||   minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,
U||   I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.
U||   Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:—
U||   “As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right
U||   now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
U||   another victim.”
U||   I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
U||   close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I
U||   appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave
U||   me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,
U||   with means to get into the house.
U||   Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can
U||   sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend
U||   to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   1 October, 4 a. m.—Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent
U||   message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at
U||   once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me. I told
U||   the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning;
U||   I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:—
U||   “He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I
U||   don’t know but what, if you don’t see him soon, he will have one of his
U||   violent fits.” I knew the man would not have said this without some
U||   cause, so I said: “All right; I’ll go now”; and I asked the others to
U||   wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my “patient.”
U||   “Take me with you, friend John,” said the Professor. “His case in your
U||   diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on our
U||   case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
U||   disturbed.”
U||   “May I come also?” asked Lord Godalming.
U||   “Me too?” said Quincey Morris. “May I come?” said Harker. I nodded, and
U||   we all went down the passage together.
U||   We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
U||   rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was
U||   an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had
U||   ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons
U||   would prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the
U||   room, but none of the others at first said anything. His request was
U||   that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home.
U||   This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and
U||   adduced his own existing sanity. “I appeal to your friends,” he said,
U||   “they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the
U||   way, you have not introduced me.” I was so much astonished, that the
U||   oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the
U||   moment; and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man’s manner,
U||   so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction:
U||   “Lord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas;
U||   Mr. Renfield.” He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:—
U||   “Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
U||   Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no
U||   more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
U||   youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much
U||   patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your
U||   great state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may
U||   have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may
U||   hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet
U||   prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its
U||   true place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure
U||   at meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms
U||   of conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised
U||   therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of
U||   brain-matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem
U||   to limit him to one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by
U||   heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold
U||   your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am
U||   as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of
U||   their liberties. And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and
U||   medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal
U||   with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances.” He
U||   made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not
U||   without its own charm.
U||   I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
U||   conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history,
U||   that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to
U||   tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
U||   necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
U||   better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old
U||   I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
U||   So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
U||   to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him
U||   in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of
U||   meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said
U||   quickly:—
U||   “But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to
U||   go at once—here—now—this very hour—this very moment, if I may. Time
U||   presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
U||   the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put
U||   before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
U||   momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” He looked at me keenly,
U||   and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and
U||   scrutinised them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went
U||   on:—
U||   “Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?”
U||   “You have,” I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.
U||   There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:—
U||   “Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for
U||   this concession—boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore
U||   in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I
U||   am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I
U||   assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and
U||   unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,
U||   sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
U||   animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest
U||   of your friends.” Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing
U||   conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method
U||   was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to
U||   let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would,
U||   like all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing
U||   at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost
U||   meeting with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield
U||   in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I
U||   thought of it afterwards—for it was as of one addressing an equal:—
U||   “Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
U||   to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me—a stranger,
U||   without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind—Dr.
U||   Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility,
U||   the privilege you seek.” He shook his head sadly, and with a look of
U||   poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:—
U||   “Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the
U||   highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
U||   reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt,
U||   since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very
U||   defect. If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest
U||   course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be
U||   wise, and help us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your
U||   wish.” He still shook his head as he said:—
U||   “Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and
U||   if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my
U||   own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am
U||   refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” I thought it was
U||   now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I
U||   went towards the door, simply saying:—
U||   “Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.”
U||   As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient.
U||   He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was
U||   about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were
U||   groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
U||   petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
U||   emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
U||   relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van
U||   Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a
U||   little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him
U||   that his efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of
U||   the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some
U||   request of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance,
U||   as when he wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into
U||   the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not
U||   realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful,
U||   he got into quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees,
U||   and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and
U||   poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his
U||   cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:—
U||   “Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out
U||   of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;
U||   send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a
U||   strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me
U||   go out of this. You don’t know what you do by keeping me here. I am
U||   speaking from the depths of my heart—of my very soul. You don’t know
U||   whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
U||   By all you hold sacred—by all you hold dear—by your love that is
U||   lost—by your hope that lives—for the sake of the Almighty, take me out
U||   of this and save my soul from guilt! Can’t you hear me, man? Can’t you
U||   understand? Will you never learn? Don’t you know that I am sane and
U||   earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting
U||   for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!”
U||   I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so
U||   would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.
U||   “Come,” I said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enough
U||   already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”
U||   He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments.
U||   Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of
U||   the bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had
U||   expected.
U||   When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a
U||   quiet, well-bred voice:—
U||   “You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind,
U||   later on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night.”
U||CHAPTER XIX
U||JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
U||   1 October, 5 a. m.—I went with the party to the search with an easy
U||   mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am
U||   so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
U||   Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at
U||   all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy
U||   and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a
U||   way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is
U||   finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I
U||   think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came
U||   away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then
U||   Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward:—
U||   “Say, Jack, if that man wasn’t attempting a bluff, he is about the
U||   sanest lunatic I ever saw. I’m not sure, but I believe that he had some
U||   serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
U||   chance.” Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:—
U||   “Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I’m glad of it,
U||   for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last
U||   hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in
U||   our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would
U||   say. All is best as they are.” Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in
U||   a dreamy kind of way:—
U||   “I don’t know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an
U||   ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
U||   seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am
U||   afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can’t forget how
U||   he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear
U||   my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count ‘lord and
U||   master,’ and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
U||   That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
U||   him, so I suppose he isn’t above trying to use a respectable lunatic.
U||   He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is
U||   best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
U||   help to unnerve a man.” The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand
U||   on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:—
U||   “Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad
U||   and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to
U||   hope for, except the pity of the good God?” Lord Godalming had slipped
U||   away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver
U||   whistle, as he remarked:—
U||   “That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I’ve got an antidote on
U||   call.” Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking
U||   care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight
U||   shone out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and
U||   took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into
U||   four little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:—
U||   “My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of
U||   many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the
U||   strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
U||   of the common kind—and therefore breakable or crushable—his are not
U||   amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
U||   in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt
U||   him as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from
U||   his touch. Keep this near your heart”—as he spoke he lifted a little
U||   silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him—“put
U||   these flowers round your neck”—here he handed to me a wreath of
U||   withered garlic blossoms—“for other enemies more mundane, this revolver
U||   and this knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps,
U||   which you can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the
U||   last, this, which we must not desecrate needless.” This was a portion
U||   of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of
U||   the others was similarly equipped. “Now,” he said, “friend John, where
U||   are the skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not
U||   break house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy’s.”
U||   Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as
U||   a surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit;
U||   after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a
U||   rusty clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges
U||   creaked, and it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image
U||   conveyed to me in Dr. Seward’s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra’s
U||   tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with
U||   one accord they shrank back. The Professor was the first to move
U||   forward, and stepped into the open door.
U||   “In manus tuas, Domine!” he said, crossing himself as he passed over
U||   the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
U||   lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The
U||   Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open
U||   it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit
U||   our lamps and proceeded on our search.
U||   The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
U||   rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
U||   shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
U||   was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so
U||   powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that
U||   terrible experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to
U||   us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders
U||   at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.
U||   The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches
U||   deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding
U||   down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked.
U||   The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were
U||   masses of spider’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked
U||   like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a
U||   table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label
U||   on each. They had been used several times, for on the table were
U||   several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed
U||   when the Professor lifted them. He turned to me and said:—
U||   “You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you
U||   know it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?” I
U||   had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been
U||   able to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong
U||   turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with
U||   iron bands. “This is the spot,” said the Professor as he turned his
U||   lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original
U||   correspondence regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found
U||   the key on the bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some
U||   unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air
U||   seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an
U||   odour as we encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at
U||   close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting
U||   stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh
U||   blood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was
U||   small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and
U||   foul. There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came
U||   through the fouler air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I
U||   describe it? It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of
U||   mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as
U||   though corruption had become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to
U||   think of it. Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung
U||   to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.
U||   Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our
U||   enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and
U||   terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which
U||   rose above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary
U||   shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set
U||   about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.
U||   We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as
U||   we began:—
U||   “The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
U||   examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
U||   clue as to what has become of the rest.” A glance was sufficient to
U||   show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and
U||   there was no mistaking them.
U||   There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,
U||   for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
U||   door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my
U||   heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to
U||   see the high lights of the Count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose,
U||   the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment,
U||   for, as Lord Godalming said, “I thought I saw a face, but it was only
U||   the shadows,” and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the
U||   direction, and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one;
U||   and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but
U||   only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place
U||   even for him. I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said
U||   nothing.
U||   A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner,
U||   which he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes,
U||   for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole
U||   mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all
U||   instinctively drew back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.
U||   For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was
U||   seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great
U||   iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,
U||   and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the
U||   huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver
U||   whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered
U||   from behind Dr. Seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about
U||   a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
U||   Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I
U||   noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
U||   taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had
U||   elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to
U||   swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
U||   moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
U||   like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the
U||   threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously
U||   lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats
U||   were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.
U||   Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
U||   on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to
U||   recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled
U||   before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score,
U||   the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but
U||   small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.
U||   With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
U||   the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
U||   their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
U||   the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
U||   Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
U||   the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding
U||   ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of
U||   dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our
U||   coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not
U||   slacken a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and barred
U||   and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the
U||   house. We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary
U||   proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had
U||   made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of
U||   uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about
U||   as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.
U||   The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
U||   Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
U||   locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
U||   when he had done.
U||   “So far,” he said, “our night has been eminently successful. No harm
U||   has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained
U||   how many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our
U||   first—and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous—step has been
U||   accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina
U||   or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
U||   smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have
U||   learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari: that the brute
U||   beasts which are to the Count’s command are yet themselves not amenable
U||   to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
U||   call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going
U||   and to that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run
U||   pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other
U||   matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster—he has
U||   not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time
U||   to-night. So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us
U||   opportunity to cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we
U||   play for the stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is
U||   close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night’s
U||   work. It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow,
U||   if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we
U||   shrink.”
U||   The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
U||   was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning
U||   sound from Renfield’s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing
U||   himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of
U||   pain.
U||   I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so
U||   softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than
U||   usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly
U||   thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
U||   deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not
U||   think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it
U||   is settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and
U||   yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once
U||   she suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to
U||   be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her
U||   that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether
U||   world. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after
U||   such confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall
U||   keep dark over to-night’s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything
U||   that has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.
U||   1 October, later.—I suppose it was natural that we should have all
U||   overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
U||   rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I
U||   slept till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call
U||   two or three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep
U||   that for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with
U||   a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad
U||   dream. She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till
U||   later in the day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed,
U||   and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be
U||   able to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our
U||   labour, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall
U||   look up Thomas Snelling to-day.
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   1 October.—It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
U||   walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
U||   is quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of the
U||   brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the
U||   night he suddenly said:—
U||   “Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him
U||   this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may
U||   be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
U||   and reason so sound.” I had some work to do which pressed, so I told
U||   him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not
U||   have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the
U||   necessary instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned
U||   him against getting any false impression from my patient. “But,” he
U||   answered, “I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to
U||   consuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of
U||   yesterday, that he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend
U||   John?”
U||   “Excuse me,” I said, “but the answer is here.” I laid my hand on the
U||   type-written matter. “When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
U||   statement of how he used to consume life, his mouth was actually
U||   nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.
U||   Harker entered the room.” Van Helsing smiled in turn. “Good!” he said.
U||   “Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it
U||   is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
U||   such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
U||   folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
U||   Who knows?” I went on with my work, and before long was through that in
U||   hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
U||   Van Helsing back in the study. “Do I interrupt?” he asked politely as
U||   he stood at the door.
U||   “Not at all,” I answered. “Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.
U||   I can go with you now, if you like.
U||   “It is needless; I have seen him!”
U||   “Well?”
U||   “I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.
U||   When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with
U||   his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
U||   discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
U||   measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. “Don’t
U||   you know me?” I asked. His answer was not reassuring: “I know you well
U||   enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take
U||   yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all
U||   thick-headed Dutchmen!” Not a word more would he say, but sat in his
U||   implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in
U||   the room at all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning
U||   from this so clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself
U||   with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it
U||   does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more
U||   to be worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her
U||   help, it is better so.”
U||   “I agree with you with all my heart,” I answered earnestly, for I did
U||   not want him to weaken in this matter. “Mrs. Harker is better out of
U||   it. Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who
U||   have been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a
U||   woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in
U||   time infallibly have wrecked her.”
U||   So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey
U||   and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I
U||   shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.
U||   Mina Harker’s Journal.
U||   1 October.—It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;
U||   after Jonathan’s full confidence for so many years, to see him
U||   manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
U||   morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
U||   Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he
U||   went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word
U||   of what had happened in the visit to the Count’s house. And yet he must
U||   have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it
U||   must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that
U||   it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work,
U||   and I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now
U||   I am crying like a silly fool, when I know it comes from my husband’s
U||   great love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.
U||   That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and
U||   lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept
U||   anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has
U||   feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my
U||   heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
U||   low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
U||   excitement.
U||   Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they
U||   told me to. I didn’t feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring
U||   anxiety. I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since
U||   Jonathan came to see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible
U||   tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end.
U||   Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring
U||   on the very thing which is most to be deplored. If I hadn’t gone to
U||   Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now. She hadn’t taken
U||   to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn’t come there in
U||   the day-time with me she wouldn’t have walked there in her sleep; and
U||   if she hadn’t gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn’t
U||   have destroyed her as he did. Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There
U||   now, crying again! I wonder what has come over me to-day. I must hide
U||   it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one
U||   morning—I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has never
U||   caused to shed a tear—the dear fellow would fret his heart out. I shall
U||   put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it. I
U||   suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn....
U||   I can’t quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing
U||   the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying
U||   on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield’s room, which is
U||   somewhere under this. And then there was silence over everything,
U||   silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of
U||   the window. All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the
U||   moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing
U||   seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate;
U||   so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost
U||   imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to
U||   have a sentience and a vitality of its own. I think that the digression
U||   of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I
U||   found a lethargy creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite
U||   sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again. The mist was
U||   spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it
U||   lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the
U||   windows. The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not
U||   distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognise in his tones
U||   some passionate entreaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a
U||   struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him. I was
U||   so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my
U||   head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy, at
U||   least so I thought; but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams,
U||   I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me. I
U||   think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I
U||   was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me. My dream was
U||   very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts
U||   become merged in, or continued in, dreams.
U||   I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I
U||   was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my
U||   hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
U||   usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn
U||   upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
U||   clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
U||   around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned
U||   down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had
U||   evidently grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to
U||   me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have
U||   got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed
U||   to chain my limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was
U||   all. I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is
U||   wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can
U||   imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it
U||   came in, for I could see it like smoke—or with the white energy of
U||   boiling water—pouring in, not through the window, but through the
U||   joinings of the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if
U||   it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room,
U||   through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like
U||   a red eye. Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy
U||   column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the
U||   scriptural words “a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” Was
U||   it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my
U||   sleep? But the pillar was composed of both the day and the
U||   night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought
U||   got a new fascination for me; till, as I looked, the fire divided, and
U||   seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy
U||   told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the
U||   dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary’s Church. Suddenly the
U||   horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those
U||   awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the
U||   moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black
U||   darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show
U||   me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be
U||   careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there
U||   were too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to
U||   prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear
U||   to alarm them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into
U||   their fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If
U||   I do not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of
U||   chloral; that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good
U||   night’s sleep. Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.
U||   2 October 10 p. m.—Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have
U||   slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the
U||   sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and
U||   spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
U||   In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he
U||   was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God
U||   bless me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of
U||   him. This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would
U||   be miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out
U||   till dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to
U||   brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I
U||   forgot how tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went
U||   off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to
U||   tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day; I could
U||   see from Jonathan’s manner that he had something important to
U||   communicate. I was not so sleepy as I should have been; so before they
U||   went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I
U||   had not slept well the night before. He very kindly made me up a
U||   sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me
U||   no harm, as it was very mild.... I have taken it, and am waiting for
U||   sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not done wrong, for as
U||   sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been
U||   foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking. I might want
U||   it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.
U||CHAPTER XX
U||JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL
U||   1 October, evening.—I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal
U||   Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything.
U||   The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him
U||   had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected
U||   debauch. I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor
U||   soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates
U||   was the responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr.
U||   Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out
U||   of a saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good,
U||   reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He
U||   remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful
U||   dog’s-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle
U||   about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in
U||   thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the
U||   boxes. There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from
U||   Carfax and left at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and
U||   another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the
U||   Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these
U||   places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might
U||   distribute more fully. The systematic manner in which this was done
U||   made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of
U||   London. He was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the
U||   east of the southern shore, and on the south. The north and west were
U||   surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme—let alone
U||   the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the
U||   south-west and west. I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could
U||   tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.
U||   He replied:—
U||   “Well, guv’nor, you’ve treated me wery ’an’some”—I had given him half a
U||   sovereign—“an’ I’ll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of
U||   Bloxam say four nights ago in the ’Are an’ ’Ounds, in Pincher’s Alley,
U||   as ’ow he an’ his mate ’ad ’ad a rare dusty job in a old ’ouse at
U||   Purfect. There ain’t a-many such jobs as this ’ere, an’ I’m thinkin’
U||   that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut.” I asked if he could tell
U||   me where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it
U||   would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the
U||   rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the
U||   search then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:—
U||   “Look ’ere, guv’nor, there ain’t no sense in me a-keepin’ you ’ere. I
U||   may find Sam soon, or I mayn’t; but anyhow he ain’t like to be in a way
U||   to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the
U||   booze. If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer
U||   address on it, I’ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye
U||   to-night. But ye’d better be up arter ’im soon in the mornin’, or maybe
U||   ye won’t ketch ’im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze
U||   the night afore.”
U||   This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to
U||   buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she
U||   came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet
U||   had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my
U||   way to home. We’re on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want
U||   sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look
U||   as though she had been crying. Poor dear, I’ve no doubt it frets her to
U||   be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and
U||   the others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed
U||   and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The
U||   doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this
U||   dreadful business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of
U||   silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under
U||   any circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for
U||   she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of
U||   the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.
U||   2 October, evening.—A long and trying and exciting day. By the first
U||   post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed,
U||   on which was written with a carpenter’s pencil in a sprawling hand:—
U||   “Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk
U||   for the depite.”
U||   I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy
U||   and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,
U||   but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange
U||   for her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own
U||   home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst
U||   us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him
U||   where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as
U||   I should have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with
U||   some difficulty, Potter’s Court. Mr. Smollet’s spelling misled me, as I
U||   asked for Poter’s Court instead of Potter’s Court. However, when I had
U||   found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran’s
U||   lodging-house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the
U||   “depite,” he shook his head, and said: “I dunno ’im. There ain’t no
U||   such a person ’ere; I never ’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days. Don’t
U||   believe there ain’t nobody of that kind livin’ ere or anywheres.” I
U||   took out Smollet’s letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the
U||   lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me. “What
U||   are you?” I asked.
U||   “I’m the depity,” he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right
U||   track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the
U||   deputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who
U||   had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
U||   Corcoran’s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o’clock that
U||   morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but
U||   he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a “new-fangled ware’us”;
U||   and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve
U||   o’clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this
U||   I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner.
U||   One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel
U||   Street a new “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition
U||   of a “new-fangled ware’us,” I at once drove to it. An interview with a
U||   surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with
U||   the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for
U||   on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his day’s wages to his
U||   foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private
U||   matter. He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and
U||   bearing. When I had promised to pay for his information and given him
U||   an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and
U||   a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine
U||   great boxes—“main heavy ones”—with a horse and cart hired by him for
U||   this purpose. I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house
U||   in Piccadilly, to which he replied:—
U||   “Well, guv’nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from
U||   a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a
U||   dusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the ’ouse we
U||   tooked the bloomin’ boxes from.”
U||   “How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”
U||   “There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin’ in the ’ouse at
U||   Purfleet. He ’elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray.
U||   Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an’ him a old
U||   feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he
U||   couldn’t throw a shadder.”
U||   How this phrase thrilled through me!
U||   “Why, ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
U||   me a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore I could up-end mine anyhow—an’ I’m no
U||   chicken, neither.”
U||   “How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?” I asked.
U||   “He was there too. He must ’a’ started off and got there afore me, for
U||   when I rung of the bell he kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’ ’elped
U||   me to carry the boxes into the ’all.”
U||   “The whole nine?” I asked.
U||   “Yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. It was
U||   main dry work, an’ I don’t so well remember ’ow I got ’ome.” I
U||   interrupted him:—
U||   “Were the boxes left in the hall?”
U||   “Yus; it was a big ’all, an’ there was nothin’ else in it.” I made one
U||   more attempt to further matters:—
U||   “You didn’t have any key?”
U||   “Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door
U||   ’isself an’ shut it again when I druv off. I don’t remember the last
U||   time—but that was the beer.”
U||   “And you can’t remember the number of the house?”
U||   “No, sir. But ye needn’t have no difficulty about that. It’s a ’igh ’un
U||   with a stone front with a bow on it, an’ ’igh steps up to the door. I
U||   know them steps, ’avin’ ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
U||   what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin’s, an’
U||   they seein’ they got so much, they wanted more; but ’e took one of them
U||   by the shoulder and was like to throw ’im down the steps, till the lot
U||   of them went away cussin’.” I thought that with this description I
U||   could find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I
U||   started off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the
U||   Count could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so,
U||   time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of
U||   distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
U||   unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked
U||   westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house
U||   described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
U||   arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long
U||   untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
U||   up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
U||   had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been
U||   a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
U||   roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
U||   Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,
U||   whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have
U||   been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
U||   given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my
U||   experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not
U||   but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some
U||   means discovered of gaining access to the house.
U||   There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side,
U||   and nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if
U||   anything could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the
U||   Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the
U||   grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything
U||   about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately
U||   been taken, but he couldn’t say from whom. He told me, however, that up
U||   to very lately there had been a notice-board of “For Sale” up, and that
U||   perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me
U||   something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on
U||   the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant
U||   know or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I
U||   strolled away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was
U||   closing in, so I did not lose any time. Having learned the address of
U||   Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at
U||   their office in Sackville Street.
U||   The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but
U||   uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the
U||   Piccadilly house—which throughout our interview he called a
U||   “mansion”—was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I
U||   asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and
U||   paused a few seconds before replying:—
U||   “It is sold, sir.”
U||   “Pardon me,” I said, with equal politeness, “but I have a special
U||   reason for wishing to know who purchased it.”
U||   Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. “It is
U||   sold, sir,” was again his laconic reply.
U||   “Surely,” I said, “you do not mind letting me know so much.”
U||   “But I do mind,” he answered. “The affairs of their clients are
U||   absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy.” This was
U||   manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with
U||   him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:—
U||   “Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their
U||   confidence. I am myself a professional man.” Here I handed him my card.
U||   “In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of
U||   Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
U||   he understood, lately for sale.” These words put a different complexion
U||   on affairs. He said:—
U||   “I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially
U||   would I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter
U||   of renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur
U||   Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship’s address I will consult
U||   the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
U||   lordship by to-night’s post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far
U||   deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
U||   lordship.”
U||   I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked
U||   him, gave the address at Dr. Seward’s and came away. It was now dark,
U||   and I was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread
U||   Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train.
U||   I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but
U||   she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart
U||   to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
U||   inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at
U||   our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
U||   confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
U||   keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or
U||   else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
U||   any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we
U||   made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our
U||   growing knowledge would be torture to her.
U||   I could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone;
U||   so after dinner—followed by a little music to save appearances even
U||   amongst ourselves—I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
U||   The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me
U||   as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I
U||   came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no
U||   difference between us.
U||   When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire
U||   in the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply
U||   read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my
U||   own information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:—
U||   “This has been a great day’s work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on
U||   the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then
U||   our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search
U||   until we find them. Then shall we make our final coup, and hunt the
U||   wretch to his real death.” We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.
U||   Morris spoke:—
U||   “Say! how are we going to get into that house?”
U||   “We got into the other,” answered Lord Godalming quickly.
U||   “But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had
U||   night and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different
U||   thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I
U||   confess I don’t see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck
U||   can find us a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his
U||   letter in the morning.” Lord Godalming’s brows contracted, and he stood
U||   up and walked about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning
U||   from one to another of us:—
U||   “Quincey’s head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we
U||   got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand—unless we
U||   can find the Count’s key basket.”
U||   As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
U||   least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from
U||   Mitchell’s, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast
U||   time. For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its
U||   various lights and bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this
U||   diary right up to the moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....
U||   Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her
U||   forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
U||   in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as
U||   she did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will
U||   be herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   1 October.—I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so
U||   rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
U||   always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more
U||   than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his
U||   repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding
U||   destiny. He was, in fact, commanding destiny—subjectively. He did not
U||   really care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds
U||   and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I
U||   thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked
U||   him:—
U||   “What about the flies these times?” He smiled on me in quite a superior
U||   sort of way—such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio—as
U||   he answered me:—
U||   “The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
U||   of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well
U||   when they typified the soul as a butterfly!”
U||   I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said
U||   quickly:—
U||   “Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?” His madness foiled his
U||   reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
U||   with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:—
U||   “Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want.” Here he
U||   brightened up; “I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is
U||   all right; I have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if
U||   you wish to study zoöphagy!”
U||   This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:—
U||   “Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?” He smiled with an
U||   ineffably benign superiority.
U||   “Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
U||   Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I
U||   may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things
U||   purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied
U||   spiritually!” This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
U||   Enoch’s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
U||   that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:—
U||   “And why with Enoch?”
U||   “Because he walked with God.” I could not see the analogy, but did not
U||   like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:—
U||   “So you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. Why not?” I put
U||   my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.
U||   The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his
U||   old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as
U||   he replied:—
U||   “I don’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don’t. I couldn’t use them
U||   if I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn’t eat
U||   them or——” He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his
U||   face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. “And doctor, as to
U||   life, what is it after all? When you’ve got all you require, and you
U||   know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends—good
U||   friends—like you, Dr. Seward”; this was said with a leer of
U||   inexpressible cunning. “I know that I shall never lack the means of
U||   life!”
U||   I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some
U||   antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such
U||   as he—a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present
U||   it was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.
U||   Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come
U||   without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him
U||   that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything
U||   to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are
U||   Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over
U||   the record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate
U||   knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish
U||   to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with
U||   me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he
U||   might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield
U||   might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were
U||   alone.
U||   I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose
U||   which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I
U||   came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on
U||   his lips:—
U||   “What about souls?” It was evident then that my surmise had been
U||   correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
U||   lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. “What about them
U||   yourself?” I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round
U||   him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration
U||   for an answer.
U||   “I don’t want any souls!” he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The
U||   matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it—to “be
U||   cruel only to be kind.” So I said:—
U||   “You like life, and you want life?”
U||   “Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’t worry about that!”
U||   “But,” I asked, “how are we to get the life without getting the soul
U||   also?” This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:—
U||   “A nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there, with
U||   the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing
U||   and twittering and miauing all round you. You’ve got their lives, you
U||   know, and you must put up with their souls!” Something seemed to affect
U||   his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,
U||   screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is
U||   being soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it
U||   also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child—only a
U||   child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was
U||   white. It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental
U||   disturbance, and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things
U||   seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as
U||   well as I could and go with him. The first step was to restore
U||   confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear
U||   me through his closed ears:—
U||   “Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” He seemed to
U||   wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:—
U||   “Not much! flies are poor things, after all!” After a pause he added,
U||   “But I don’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”
U||   “Or spiders?” I went on.
U||   “Blow spiders! What’s the use of spiders? There isn’t anything in them
U||   to eat or”—he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden
U||   topic.
U||   “So, so!” I thought to myself, “this is the second time he has suddenly
U||   stopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” Renfield seemed
U||   himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to
U||   distract my attention from it:—
U||   “I don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘Rats and mice and such
U||   small deer,’ as Shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder’ they
U||   might be called. I’m past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well
U||   ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to
U||   interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before
U||   me.”
U||   “I see,” I said. “You want big things that you can make your teeth meet
U||   in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?”
U||   “What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” He was getting too wide
U||   awake, so I thought I would press him hard. “I wonder,” I said
U||   reflectively, “what an elephant’s soul is like!”
U||   The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his
U||   high-horse and became a child again.
U||   “I don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul at all!” he said. For a
U||   few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with
U||   his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “To
U||   hell with you and your souls!” he shouted. “Why do you plague me about
U||   souls? Haven’t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me
U||   already, without thinking of souls!” He looked so hostile that I
U||   thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The
U||   instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said
U||   apologetically:—
U||   “Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so
U||   worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the
U||   problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and
U||   tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I
U||   want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am
U||   sure you will understand!” He had evidently self-control; so when the
U||   attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield
U||   watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable
U||   dignity and sweetness:—
U||   “Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that
U||   I am very, very grateful to you!” I thought it well to leave him in
U||   this mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder
U||   over in this man’s state. Several points seem to make what the American
U||   interviewer calls “a story,” if one could only get them in proper
U||   order. Here they are:—
U||   Will not mention “drinking.”
U||   Fears the thought of being burdened with the “soul” of anything.
U||   Has no dread of wanting “life” in the future.
U||   Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being
U||   haunted by their souls.
U||   Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind
U||   that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence—the
U||   burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!
U||   And the assurance—?
U||   Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme
U||   of terror afoot!
U||   Later.—I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion.
U||   He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a while
U||   asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door we
U||   heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time
U||   which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that
U||   he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the
U||   autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk
U||   of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend.
U||   He went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He
U||   had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to
U||   come away as ignorant as we went in.
U||   His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.
U||   Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming.
U||   “1 October.
U||   “My Lord,
U||   “We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with
U||   regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your
U||   behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and
U||   purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors
U||   of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign
U||   nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
U||   purchase money in notes ‘over the counter,’ if your Lordship will
U||   pardon us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing
U||   whatever of him.
U||   “We are, my Lord,
U||   “Your Lordship’s humble servants,
U||   “Mitchell, Sons & Candy.”
U||   Dr. Seward’s Diary.
U||   2 October.—I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to
U||   make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield’s room,
U||   and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he
U||   was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire
U||   in the study—Mrs. Harker having gone to bed—we discussed the attempts
U||   and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,
U||   and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.
U||   Before going to bed I went round to the patient’s room and looked in
U||   through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart
U||   rose and fell with regular respiration.
U||   This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after
U||   midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I
U||   asked him if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There
U||   was something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point
U||   blank if he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having
U||   “dozed” for a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless
U||   they are watched.
U||   To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are
U||   looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have
U||   horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we
U||   seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported
U||   earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his
U||   weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the
U||   British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old
U||   physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,
U||   and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
