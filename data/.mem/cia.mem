U||The Honorable Avril Haines
U||Director of National Intelligence
U||Washington, DC 20511
U||Dear DNI Haines:
U||(U) With this letter, we transmit our 90-day report on commercially available information (CAI).
U||We appreciate your commissioning the report and the assistance of your office and other
U||Intelligence Community (IC) elements in this time-sensitive undertaking.
U||(U) As prescribed in our terms of reference (TOR), the report attempts to “(1) describe the role
U||of CAI in intelligence collection and analysis; (2) reflect on the existing framework for ensuring
U||the protection of privacy and civil liberties; and (3) make[] recommendations to the IC regarding
U||how and under what circumstances an IC element should collect, use, retain, and disseminate
U||CAI.” These three issues, preceded by a background description and explanation of CAI, are
U||addressed in the four main parts of our report.
U||(U) Our report does not attempt “an independent legal analysis” of the issues involved with CAI,
U||as set forth in our TOR, but instead follows the IC’s own approach in considering questions of
U||CAI policy.
U||(U) Our report addresses CAI that is available for purchase by the general public and as such is
U||treated as a subset of publicly available information (PAI). Unless otherwise indicated in
U||context, we use the term “CAI” in this report to refer to CAI that is also PAI.
U||(U) Highlights of our report include the following:
U||1. (U) There is today a large and growing amount of CAI that is available to the general public,
U||including foreign governments (and their intelligence services) and private-sector entities, as
U||well as the IC.
U||2. (U) CAI clearly provides intelligence value, whether considered in isolation and/or in
U||combination with other information, and whether reviewed by humans and/or by machines. It
U||also raises significant issues related to privacy and civil liberties. The widespread availability of
U||CAI regarding the activities of large numbers of individuals is a relatively new, rapidly growing,
U||and increasingly significant part of the information environment in which the IC must function.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||2
U||3. (U) Under IC elements’ rules and procedures, CAI (because it is also PAI) is less strictly
U||regulated than other forms of information acquired by the IC. In our view, however, profound
U||changes in the scope and sensitivity of CAI have overtaken traditional understandings, at least
U||as a matter of policy. Today’s publicly available CAI is very different in degree and in kind from
U||traditional PAI.
U||4. (U) We have three recommendations concerning the acquisition and treatment of CAI by the
U||IC.
U||(U) First, the IC should develop a multi-layered process to catalog, to the extent feasible, the
U||CAI that IC elements acquire. This will be a complex undertaking requiring attention to
U||procurement contracts, functionally equivalent data acquisition processes, data flows, and data
U||use. The IC cannot understand and improve how it deals with CAI unless and until it knows what
U||it is doing with CAI.
U||(U) Second, based on the knowledge gained from that process, the IC should develop a set of
U||standards and procedures for CAI, governing and requiring regular re-evaluation of acquisition
U||and use decisions, including as to the use of CAI. We offer several points that can be included in
U||those standards and procedures, but also recognize that they will need to be adapted for
U||different IC elements with different CAI needs and missions.
U||(U) Third, as part of this set of policies and procedures, and/or as a complement to it, the IC
U||should develop more precise guidance to identify and protect sensitive CAI that implicates
U||privacy and civil liberties concerns. Again, we offer several suggestions for the development of
U||such guidance.
U||(U) The single most important point in our report is this: CAI is increasingly powerful for
U||intelligence and increasingly sensitive for individual privacy and civil liberties, and the IC
U||therefore needs to develop more refined policies to govern its acquisition and treatment. Our
U||report does not prescribe those policies (in keeping with our timeline and role as outside
U||advisors) but we hope that it will assist the IC with their development.
U||(U) We appreciate the opportunity to be of service.
U||Respectfully submitted,

U||(U) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
U||(U) There is today a large and growing amount of what the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC)
U||refers to as “Commercially Available Information” (CAI). As the acronym indicates, and as we
U||use the term in this report, CAI is information that is available commercially to the general
U||public, and as such, is a subset of publicly available information (PAI). We do not use the term
U||CAI to include, and we do not address in this report, commercial information that is available
U||exclusively to governments. The volume and sensitivity of CAI have expanded in recent years
U||mainly due to the advancement of digital technology, including location-tracking and other
U||features of smartphones and other electronic devices, and the advertising-based monetization
U||models that underlie many commercial offerings available on the Internet. Although CAI may be
U||“anonymized,” it is often possible (using other CAI) to deanonymize and identify individuals,
U||including U.S. persons.
U||(U//FOUO) CAI clearly provides intelligence value, whether considered in isolation and/or in
U||combination with other information, and whether reviewed by humans and/or by machines.
U||The IC currently acquires a significant amount of CAI for mission-related purposes, including in
U||some cases social media data
U||and many other types of information. As a resource available to the general
U||public, including adversaries, CAI also raises counter-intelligence risks for the IC. It also has
U||increasingly important risks and implications for U.S. person privacy and civil liberties, as CAI
U||can reveal sensitive and intimate information about individuals. Without proper controls, CAI
U||can be misused to cause substantial harm, embarrassment, and inconvenience to U.S. persons.
U||The widespread availability of CAI regarding the activities of large numbers of individuals is a
U||relatively new, rapidly growing, and increasingly significant part of the information environment
U||in which the IC must function. That is the core of why it was necessary and appropriate for the
U||IC to recognize the complex issues inherent in modern CAI and to commission this report.
U||(U//FOUO) Under the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and IC elements’ internal procedures,
U||CAI is generally less strictly regulated than other forms of information acquired by the IC,
U||principally because it is publicly available. In our view, however, changes in CAI have
U||considerably undermined the historical policy rationale for treating PAI categorically as non-
U||sensitive information, that the IC can use without significantly affecting the privacy and civil
U||liberties of U.S. persons. For example, under Carpenter v. United States, acquisition of
U||persistent location information (and perhaps other detailed information) concerning one
U||person by law enforcement from communications providers is a Fourth Amendment “search”
U||that generally requires probable cause. However, the same type of information on millions of
U||Americans is openly for sale to the general public. As such, IC policies treat the information as
U||PAI and IC elements can purchase it. While IC policies regulate such information based on the
U||volume, proportion and sensitivity of USPI it contains, those policies may not accord sufficient
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||2
U||protection to information that is now broadly understood to be sensitive. It is not sufficient as a
U||matter of policy simply to say that CAI is PAI; and saying so without more may be affirmatively
U||confusing to intelligence professionals.
U||(U) We have three recommendations.
U||(U//FOUO) First, the IC should develop a multi-layered approach to catalog, to the extent
U||feasible, the acquisition and use of CAI across its 18 elements. This cataloging process will be
U||complex and should include formal contracts and procurement decisions, as well as functionally
U||equivalent agency-specific data acquisition processes, because these will help identify CAI when
U||it first arrives at (or becomes available to) an IC element. But the process also should include
U||detection efforts at later stages of the information lifecycle, including in the process of planning
U||for and initially using data. In particular, key inputs to the process may include (1)
U||documentation reflecting the purchase, license, or other acquisition of a CAI dataset; (2) audits
U||by chief information officers (CIOs) and chief data officers (CDOs) responsible for monitoring
U||data flows across agency systems and repositories; and (3)
U||We recommend this multi-layered approach because prior retrospective efforts
U||focused on procurement have not been successful, and because the dynamic nature of the CAI
U||environment will require ongoing review. This first recommendation is foundational for our
U||remaining two recommendations.
U||(U//FOUO) Second, as it gains knowledge into its own use of CAI, the IC should develop a set of
U||standards and procedures for CAI, governing and requiring regular re-evaluation of acquisition
U||and other decisions. This can be done centrally, for the IC or the Defense Intelligence Enterprise
U||(DIE) as a whole, and/or at individual IC elements (where the approaches could vary from one
U||element to another as long as they are consistent in principle). Either way, as the IC develops
U||approaches to CAI, it will need to keep in mind IC elements’ authorities and needs. Among the
U||issues that should be considered in developing IC standards and procedures are the following:
U||Mission analysis to identify need/value; Fit between mission and CAI data set, Proposed use;
U||Vendor and data quality; Acquisition mechanics; Data security; Sensitivity and legal review;
U||Auditing use of CAI; Periodic re-evaluation; and Other structural and procedural issues. We
U||review several examples of IC elements’ approaches to these issues, including the
U||(U//FOUO) Third, as part of this set of standards and procedures, and/or as a complement to it,
U||the IC should develop more precise sensitivity and privacy-protecting guidance for CAI. PAI is
U||no longer a good proxy for non-sensitive information. Today, in a way that far fewer Americans
U||seem to understand, and even fewer of them can avoid, CAI includes information on nearly
U||everyone that is of a type and level of sensitivity that historically could have been obtained, if at
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET/
U||3
U||all, only through targeted (and predicated) collection, and that could be used to cause harm to
U||an individual’s reputation, emotional well-being, or physical safety. The IC therefore needs to
U||develop more refined approaches to CAI. Among the structural and procedural issues that
U||should be considered in developing such approaches are the following: Required involvement
U||of relevant parties at all stages; VPS assessments generally being made prior to acquisition, or
U||at least prior to analytic use of CAI, and ideally integrated or coordinated with CAI acquisition
U||reviews discussed in Recommendation #2; Approval requirements, with higher levels of
U||approval required for more sensitive cases; Documentation, retention, and availability to
U||relevant personnel of assessments, approvals, and mitigation measures adopted; Re-evaluation
U||of VPS assessments and measures; Forwarding of assessments and other documentation to
U||ODNI and/or other central authorities, with a formal mechanism for periodic review to allow
U||comparisons and discussion of best practices across IC elements and related purposes.
U||(U//FOUO) Apart from the structural and procedural issues above, we recommend that IC
U||elements also consider the following substantive issues in developing VPS guidance for CAI:
U||Sensitivity of the CAI, in keeping with the discussion of sensitivity in Part 2 of this report;
U||Deanonymization/reidentification issues; Importance of mission served by CAI (to balance
U||against sensitivity of CAI); Strength of nexus between CAI and mission, and availability,
U||feasibility, costs, and risks of alternatives; Ability to filter USPI prior to ingestion; Traditional
U||minimization approaches and techniques; Availability of other privacy-protective measures in
U||light of the need and anticipated use of CAI.
U||(U//FOUO) Some IC elements have already made progress towards developing new VPS
U||guidance, and we review several specific approaches that are in effect or are in the process of
U||being developed. We offer four specific areas, drawn from the longer list above, in which such
U||development would be particularly helpful. First, distinctions between types of CAI, including
U||between historical CAI (e.g., newspapers) that are generally less sensitive, and newer forms of
U||CAI that are generally more sensitive. Second, quantitative issues, because CAI that is acquired
U||in bulk will almost always be more sensitive than CAI in smaller data sets. Third, special
U||protections for USPs and USPI. Fourth and finally, issues raised by CAI that can easily be
U||deanonymized, including implications for the definition of USPI as applied in this context.
U||(U) In conclusion, if some or all of our recommendations are agreeable, the IC will need a
U||mechanism for putting them into effect – e.g., a traditional working group of IC senior officials.
U||Such a working group might decide to proceed within the framework of our three
U||recommendations, or it might adopt and build on their substance within a different framework
U||– e.g., substantive principles; tools and procedures; and processes and approval requirements.
U||We hope that our 90-day report provides a helpful foundation for developing more refined
U||approaches, we believe that continued efforts will be necessary, and we appreciate the
U||opportunity to be of service.

U||1. (U) BACKGROUND ON COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION
U||(U) There is today a large and growing amount of what the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC)
U||refers to as “Commercially Available Information” (CAI). As the acronym indicates, and as we
U||use the term in this report, CAI is information that is available commercially to the general
U||public, and as such, is a subset of publicly available information (PAI). We do not use the term
U||CAI to include, and we do not address in this report, commercial information that is available
U||exclusively to governments. The volume and sensitivity of CAI have expanded in recent years
U||mainly due to the advancement of digital technology, including location-tracking and other
U||features of smartphones and other electronic devices, and the advertising-based monetization
U||models that underlie many commercial offerings available on the Internet. Although CAI may be
U||“anonymized,” it is often possible (using other CAI) to deanonymize and identify individuals,
U||including U.S. persons.
U||1.1. (U) What is CAI? One of the challenges faced by the IC in dealing with CAI is defining the
U||term, and hence the scope of any new guidance or policies that may be developed to address it.
U||As the acronym indicates, and as we use it in this report, “CAI” is information that is available
U||commercially, through a commercial transaction with another party. The acquisition may occur
U||on a one-time or subscription basis, and may involve the IC directly ingesting the CAI or
U||obtaining a license agreement that affords a continuing right of access. CAI typically is acquired
U||for a fee, but as we use the term it also includes information offered at no cost if it is the type
U||of information that is normally offered for sale – e.g., a free trial offering of CAI.
U||(U) As we use the term in this report, CAI does not include information that is stolen or
U||otherwise misappropriated and then acquired from a black market or otherwise via traditional
U||HUMINT acquisition methods (e.g., espionage). Nor does it include information obtained
U||through traditional SIGINT acquisition methods (e.g., wiretapping) that does not involve a
U||commercial transaction at all. As such, it does not necessarily include all information acquired
U||from commercial entities, such as information acquired via lawful process (e.g., a search
U||warrant or subpoena) served on a communications service provider or financial institution.
U||(U) In taking this approach to CAI, we generally follow the definition in the Intelligence
U||Community Data Management Lexicon:
U||(U) Any information that is of a type customarily made available or obtainable and sold,
U||leased, or licensed to the general public or to non-governmental entities for purposes
U||other than governmental purposes. Commercially Available Information also includes
U||information for exclusive government use, knowingly and voluntarily provided by,
U||procured from, or made accessible by corporate entities at the request of a government
U||entity, or on their own initiative.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||2
U||(U) Although some CAI is available only to governments, as the Lexicon notes, we use the term
U||to mean, and this report addresses, only the subset of CAI that is generally available and is
U||therefore also publicly available information (PAI). Under IC guidelines, PAI is defined as
U||information that has been published or broadcast for public consumption, is available
U||on request to the public, is accessible online or otherwise to the public, is available to
U||the public by subscription or purchase, could be seen or heard by any casual observer
U||(but not amounting to physical surveillance), is made available at a meeting open to the
U||public, or is observed by visiting any place or attending any event that is open to the
U||public.
U||(U) Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Activities Procedures Approved
U||by the Attorney General Pursuant to Executive Order 12333 (ODNI Guidelines) § 10.17
U||(emphasis added); see also Central Intelligence Agency Activities: Procedures Approved by the
U||Attorney General Pursuant to Executive Order 12333 (CIA Guidelines) § 12.20; DOD Manual
U||5240.01: Procedures Governing the Conduct of DOD Intelligence Activities (DOD Manual) § G.2
U||at page 53.
U||(U) To repeat for emphasis and clarity, unless otherwise indicated in context, we use the term
U||“CAI” to refer to CAI that is also PAI, and our report addresses only CAI that is also PAI. Non-
U||public CAI raises distinct legal and policy questions and is beyond the scope of our current
U||efforts.
U||(U//FOUO) Our discussions with IC elements included a heavy emphasis on defining CAI, a
U||valuable and foundational effort for this report and any future regulation of CAI. Focus on a
U||formal definition, however, should not obscure the functional perspective that animates our
U||recommendations. As discussed in the balance of this report, CAI merits special attention today
U||because of its increasing importance for intelligence as well as for privacy and civil liberties (as
U||discussed in Part 2), and because it has, at least in part, overtaken current IC policies that
U||address it (as discussed in Part 3). Those concerns should inform efforts to apply, and if
U||necessary to modify, the formal definition of CAI in the many, varied and evolving contexts that
U||the IC does and will face. Cf. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, Report to the President
U||on Implementation of Presidential Policy Directive 28: Signals Intelligence Activities at 12, 24
U||(noting the absence of a formal definition of “signals intelligence” under PPD-28).
U||1.2. (U) CAI Sellers. A key feature of CAI is that it is often sold or otherwise made available by
U||commercial entities. Sellers of CAI are often referred to as “data brokers” or “information
U||resellers.” As the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in December 2013, these
U||sellers of CAI
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||3
U||maintain large, sophisticated databases with consumer information that can include
U||credit histories, insurance claims, criminal records, employment histories, incomes,
U||ethnicities, purchase histories, and interests. Resellers largely obtain their information
U||from public records, publicly available information (such as directories and newspapers),
U||and nonpublic information (such as from retail loyalty cards, warranty registrations,
U||contests, and web browsing). Characterizing the precise size and nature of the reseller
U||industry can be difficult because of limited publicly known information about the
U||industry.
U||(U) In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2019, a GAO official repeated
U||the substance of those observations from 2013 and provided the following graphic to illustrate
U||the development of and market for CAI:
U||Graph is Unclassified
U||(U) A May 2014 report from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provides a similar account:
U||(U) Data brokers collect data from commercial, government, and other publicly available
U||sources. Data collected could include bankruptcy information, voting registration,
U||consumer purchase data, web browsing activities, warranty registrations, and other
U||details of consumers’ everyday interactions. Data brokers do not obtain this data
U||directly from consumers, and consumers are thus largely unaware that data brokers are
U||collecting and using this information. While each data broker source may provide only a
U||few data elements about a consumer’s activities, data brokers can put all of these data
U||elements together to form a more detailed composite of the consumer’s life.
U||(U) Civil society groups in the United States have also described data brokers and the market for
U||CAI in the context of their public advocacy efforts. A recent example is the report from the
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||4
U||Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), Legal Loopholes and Data for Dollars, released in
U||December 2021. As of this writing, major data brokers include Accenture, Acxiom, CoreLogic,
U||Epsilon, Intelius, LexisNexis, Oracle (Datalogix), Thomson Reuters, and Verisk (these companies,
U||and the ones further discussed below, are listed solely for purposes of illustration, and
U||references to the work of civil society groups are similarly for descriptive purposes only). In
U||general, CAI sellers include those focused on marketing and advertising, fraud detection, risk
U||mitigation, and identity resolution (people finders). Purchasers of CAI include other data
U||brokers, various private-sector and non-governmental entities, and governments worldwide,
U||including the IC.
U||1.3. (U) Examples of CAI. We do not attempt a comprehensive description of the scope and
U||scale of data that are available as CAI, or the relevant markets, in part because they are so large
U||and so dynamic. However, a few examples of CAI offerings will illustrate the current nature of
U||available offerings:
U||• (U) “Thomson Reuters CLEAR® is powered by billions of data points and leverages
U||cutting-edge public records technology to bring all key content together in a
U||customizable dashboard.”
U||• (U) LexisNexis offers more than “84B records from 10,000+ sources, including
U||alternative data that helps surface more of the 63M unbanked/underbanked U.S.
U||adults.”
U||• (U) Exactis has “over 3.5 billion records (updated monthly)” in its “universal data
U||warehouse.”
U||• (U) PeekYou “collects and combines scattered content from social sites, news sources,
U||homepages, and blog platforms to present comprehensive online identities.”
U||(U) As these examples show, there is a large and growing amount of CAI in existence and
U||offered for sale, some of it sensitive with respect to privacy. The market for CAI, including
U||analysis and exploitation of CAI for insight, is evolving both qualitatively (e.g., as to types of
U||data available) and quantitatively (as to amounts of data available) – see, for example, this
U||March 2021 summary from Gartner. It includes significant information on U.S. persons, much of
U||which can be acquired in bulk. As discussed below, moreover, certain CAI that is “anonymized”
U||and available in bulk can readily be reidentified to reveal information about individuals.
U||1.4. (U) Origins & Evolution of CAI. In substantial part, the vast and growing amount of available
U||CAI results from evolving digital technology, and the proliferation of digital dust created by
U||individuals in their daily lives. As our TOR explain, “[t]he digital revolution has placed an
U||incredible amount of information into the hands of private actors, many of whom seek to sell
U||the data.” For example, CAI can be obtained from public records, sometimes digitized from
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||5
U||paper originals, such as information about real estate transactions that can be found in local
U||title offices or courthouses. It can be obtained from smartphone and other software
U||applications, often in the form of software development kits (SDK), that collect information
U||from devices in the U.S. and abroad. And CAI can be obtained from cookies and other methods,
U||sometimes associated with real-time bidding (RTB) for sales of online advertising, that track end
U||users as they browse the Internet. In April 2021, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators raised
U||questions about “the sharing of Americans’ data through ‘real time bidding’ – the auction
U||process used to place many targeted digital advertisements.” The details of these digital
U||developments are beyond the scope of this report; it is sufficient for our purposes, and widely
U||understood among intelligence professionals and policymakers, that they have significantly
U||contributed to the profound increase in CAI.
U||1.5. (U) Commercial Value of CAI. Various forms of CAI can be combined to synergistic effect in
U||service of various commercial interests. For example, according to an October 2020 press
U||release from Gartner, the “internet of behaviors (IoB) is emerging as many technologies capture
U||and use the ‘digital dust’ of peoples’ daily lives. The IoB combines existing technologies that
U||focus on the individual directly – facial recognition, location tracking and big data for example –
U||and connects the resulting data to associated behavioral events, such as cash purchases or
U||device usage.” As the FTC explained in its May 2014 report:
U||(U) Data brokers rely on websites with registration features and cookies to find
U||consumers online and target Internet advertisements to them based on their offline
U||activities. Once a data broker locates a consumer online and places a cookie on the
U||consumer’s browser, the data broker’s client can advertise to that consumer across the
U||Internet for as long as the cookie stays on the consumer’s browser. Consumers may not
U||be aware that data brokers are providing companies with products to allow them to
U||advertise to consumers online based on their offline activities. Some data brokers are
U||using similar technology to serve targeted advertisements to consumers on mobile
U||devices.
U||(U) The commercial value of CAI is plainly high, which is why the market for CAI is large and
U||growing.
U||1.6 (U) Deanonymization/Reidentification. CAI can also be combined, or used with other non-
U||CAI data, to reverse engineer identities or deanonymize various forms of information. As the
U||New York Times reported in December 2019, “[i]f you own a mobile phone, its every move is
U||logged and tracked by dozens of companies … The Times Privacy Project obtained a dataset
U||with more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million people in this
U||country. It was a random sample from 2016 and 2017, but it took only minutes — with
U||assistance from publicly available information — for us to deanonymize location data.” The
U||Times was able to track the movements of President Trump via a member of his Secret Service
U||detail. Deanonymized data may be useful for commercial and/or intelligence purposes.

U||2. (U) THE ROLE OF CAI IN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
U||(U//FOUO) CAI clearly provides intelligence value, whether considered in isolation and/or in
U||combination with other information, and whether reviewed by humans and/or by machines. The
U||IC currently acquires a significant amount of CAI for mission-related purposes, including in some
U||cases social media data
U||and many other types of information. As a resource available to the general
U||public, including adversaries, CAI also raises counter-intelligence risks for the IC. It also has
U||increasingly important risks and implications for U.S. person privacy and civil liberties, as CAI
U||can reveal sensitive and intimate information about individuals. Without proper controls, CAI
U||can be misused to cause substantial harm, embarrassment, and inconvenience to U.S. persons.
U||The widespread availability of CAI regarding the activities of large numbers of individuals is a
U||relatively new, rapidly growing, and increasingly significant part of the information environment
U||in which the IC must function. That is the core of why it was necessary and appropriate for the IC
U||to recognize the complex issues inherent in modern CAI and to commission this report.
U||2.1. (U) CAI as a Source for OSINT. For the IC, CAI provides intelligence value as a form of
U||publicly available information used to create Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), as well as for
U||other purposes including force protection and enrichment of information in other INT
U||disciplines. Many recent commissions and reports have focused on the value of CAI and other
U||PAI as OSINT. For example, in 2005, the WMD Commission’s report concluded (pages 22-23)
U||that “analysts who use open source information can be more effective than those who don’t,”
U||and urged creation of an “entity that collects, processes, and makes available to analysts the
U||mass of open source information that is available in the world today.” Similarly, the January
U||2019 “AIM Initiative” from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which is a
U||strategy for augmenting intelligence using machines, explained “the IC must develop both the
U||capability and capacity to take advantage of available data across all INTs and open source, and
U||develop AI solutions that process and relate information from multiple modalities.” A January
U||2021 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) notes that the IC
U||must “encourage IC agencies to integrate OSINT into collection and analytic tradecraft,”
U||because the “combination of cloud, cloud-based AI and analytics tools, and commercial GEOINT
U||and SIGINT collection means that high-quality, multi-source intelligence analysis can be
U||produced at the unclassified level from anywhere equipped to do so.”
U||2.2. (U) Examples of CAI Contracts. The IC currently acquires a large amount of CAI. Unclassified
U||IC and other contracts for CAI can be found at Sam.Gov, a U.S. government website that allows
U||searching by agency or sub-agency and by keywords, among other things. By way of example
U||only, this website shows that the following agencies have, have had, have considered, or are
U||considering the following contracts or proposals related to CAI:
U||• (U) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with ZeroFox for social media alerting
U||(15F06721P0002431)
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||8
U||•
U||• (U) The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for social media reports on individuals who
U||are seeking a security clearance (HHM402-16-SM-CHECKS), and with LexisNexis for
U||“retrieval of comprehensive on-line search results related to commercial due diligence
U||from a maximum number of sources (news, company, public records, legal, regulatory
U||financial, and industry information),” among other things (HHM402-21-Q-0094)
U||• (U) The U.S. Navy with Sayari Analytics, Inc. for access to its database that “contains tens
U||of thousands of previously-unidentified specific nodes, facilities and key people related
U||to US sanctioned actors including ‘2+3’ threats to national security” (N0001518PR11212)
U||• (U) Various offices within the Treasury Department for access to Banker’s Almanac
U||(RFQ-FIN-55100-21-0010)
U||• (U) The Department of Defense (DOD) for access to Jane’s online (W31P4Q17T0009)
U||• (U) The Coast Guard with Babel Street for “Open Source Data Collection, Translation,
U||Analysis Application” (70Z08419QVA044).
U||(U) In addition, DIA has provided the following information about a CAI contract in an
U||unclassified and publicly-available paper sent to Congress on January 15, 2021:
U||(U) DIA currently provides funding to another agency that purchases commercially
U||available geolocation metadata aggregated from smartphones. The data DIA receives is
U||global in scope and is not identified as “U.S. location data” or “foreign location data” by
U||the vendor at the time it is provisioned to DIA. DIA processes the location data as it
U||arrives to identify U.S. location data points that it segregates in a separate database. DIA
U||personnel can only query the U.S. location database when authorized through a specific
U||process requiring approval from the Office of General Counsel (OGC), Office of Oversight
U||and Compliance (OOC), and DIA senior leadership. Permission to query the U.S. device
U||location data has been granted five times in the past two-and-a-half years for
U||authorized purposes.
U||(U) In the process of preparing this report, DHS described for us three ways in which CAI is
U||generally used by its Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A):
U||• (U//FOUO) Web of Science is a powerful targeting tool, as it allows DHS I&A analysts to
U||quickly and efficiently search and triage a large repository of academic publications and
U||filter according to funding sources, affiliations, co-authors, and other key terms. This
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||9
U||service provides critical insight into academic publications that are not easily found
U||elsewhere or are hidden behind paywalls when searched via other means, such as
U||Google Scholar. For example, using Web of Science, DHS I&A analysts have identified
U||foreign researchers studying in the United States with previously unknown associations
U||with their home country’s military. Additionally, through the currently OSDLS-managed
U||subscriptions, we are also able to access the Web of Science API, which allows us to
U||apply data analytics to the database.
U||• (U//FOUO) CLEAR enables DHS I&A to resolve identities and also provides leads for
U||further analysis in DHS systems, thereby focusing resources on threat actors and not
U||innocent persons. Commercial databases like CLEAR often have current location and
U||contact information as well. Often, given the target set we focus on – non-traditional
U||collectors – intelligence collection is not sufficient to resolve identities of subjects of
U||interest. Data available in a commercially available datasets enables identity resolution
U||by comparing it to what’s in DHS systems and also reduces the risk of misidentification.
U||• (U//FOUO) Dun and Bradstreet and similar tools enable DHS I&A to resolve private
U||companies’ primary enterprises with their subsidiaries/affiliates and provides leads for
U||further analysis in DHS systems and classified databases. Access to this information is
U||critical to countering malign foreign investment that may threaten the security and
U||resiliency of U.S. critical infrastructure.
U||2.3. (U) Examples of CAI Value. In our classified briefings with IC elements, we discussed the
U||intelligence value of CAI, including how it can be used to reduce cost and risk of acquisition that
U||might otherwise occur through clandestine means. The IC is strongly of the view that it will be
U||at a significant disadvantage vis a vis foreign adversaries and competitors if it does not enjoy
U||certain access to CAI. We urge the IC to make available several unclassified examples showing
U||the value of CAI because we believe it will help inform the policy debate, in keeping with
U||Principles of Intelligence Transparency for the IC. The IC has done this in the past in other
U||contexts, including for Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.
U||(U) Here are two unclassified examples provided by the IC in response to our request while we
U||were preparing this report:
U||• (U//FOUO) “NSA’s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center leveraged commercial and SIGINT
U||sources to expand the community sight picture on the advanced persistent threat
U||Cobalt Strike actor. Analysts used enterprise access from
U||and others to identify a pattern in the registration of the
U||seed nodes shared by the 370 domains – of which 19 were tagged by and of
U||those, 7 resolved to CobaltStrike infrastructure. A pattern in uniform resource locators
U||(URLs) was also discovered to be associated with CobaltStrike using CAI which led to the
U||discovery of an additional 49 internet protocol (IP) addresses.”
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||10
U||• (U//FOUO) “CAI allows the IC to create valuable products for excluded missions like
U||HADR [humanitarian assistance and disaster response]. These products are similar to
U||those created by the commercial and academic community. These types of use cases
U||focus on providing strategic level analytic outputs on how events affect human mobility
U||at-scale or the country level. Examples include but are not limited to, how natural
U||disasters and the spread of disease affect the movement of humans and vice versa.”
U||(U) We expect that the IC will be able to provide additional unclassified examples over time. If
U||necessary, moreover, classified examples should be made available to appropriate audiences.
U||We believe that CAI is extremely and increasingly valuable and important for the conduct of
U||modern intelligence activity, both as a source of OSINT and to support, enrich and enable other
U||INT disciplines.
U||2.4. (U) Non-Analytic Uses of CAI. It is important to recognize that in some cases, CAI may also
U||be used for purposes other than intelligence collection and analysis. At the outset, of course,
U||the FBI uses CAI under its law enforcement authorities, as authorized in AG Guidelines and FBI
U||policy, for the investigation of criminal matters, and non-intelligence elements of DOD may also
U||use CAI for their missions. We also briefly consider three non-analytic intelligence use cases of
U||CAI.
U||(U//FOUO) First, CAI may be useful in supporting compliance with legal or policy requirements.
U||For example, geolocation CAI might be able to support compliance with 50 U.S.C. § 1881a
U||(Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act), which generally applies only to collection targeting
U||non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. CAI can help
U||determine location for compliance with this core requirement of Section 1881a. It may also be
U||useful in complying with requirements established by Congress for situations in which non-U.S.
U||persons abroad who are under surveillance travel into the United States. See 50 U.S.C. §
U||1805(f). More generally, CAI may also help establish the “foreignness” of SIGINT or other
U||collection targets as necessary to meet legal or policy requirements.
U||(U//FOUO) Second, CAI may also be used in support of clandestine and HUMINT operations. CAI
U||utilized in support of operations uniquely enables activities like cover development and
U||operations planning. These activities are tightly held within the IC and subject to extremely
U||restrictive operations access and handling rules. Further, CAI data obtained to support
U||operations is outside the IC’s classic analysis and intelligence reporting streams – it is not
U||disseminated.
U||(U) Third, CAI may be useful in building and training artificial intelligence models. Although non-
U||analytical in the strict sense, such models themselves can then be used to gain analytic insight
U||or for other purposes.
U||SECRET/
U||SECRET//
U||11
U||(U) We do not mean to suggest a policy outcome in these particular use cases. Our only point is
U||that policy questions concerning CAI are not one-dimensional. The importance and nature of
U||the need, the absence of viable alternatives for meeting it, restrictions on access to and use and
U||dissemination of data, should all be considered in reaching an appropriate policy judgment in
U||each case – assuming, as always, that outcomes are not dictated by law. It may be, for example,
U||that certain privacy-protecting methods, such as encrypting, masking, and use of differential
U||privacy, may be viable for some mission needs even if not for others.
U||2.5. (U) Counter-Intelligence Risks in CAI. There is also a growing recognition that CAI, as a
U||generally available resource, offers intelligence benefits to our adversaries, some of which may
U||create counter-intelligence risk for the IC. For example, the January 2021 CSIS report cited
U||above also urges the IC to “test and demonstrate the utility of OSINT and AI in analysis on
U||critical threats, such as the adversary use of AI-enabled capabilities in disinformation and
U||influence operations.” Additional risks are developed in this April 2021 Lawfare article and this
U||August 2021 report from Duke University.
U||(U) The Duke University report describes certain counter-intelligence risks from CAI. It finds, for
U||example, that of 10 major data brokers surveyed, three advertise that they can provide data to
U||identify U.S. military personnel. The report goes on to note (as summarized in a Lawfare article
U||by its author): “Foreign actors could use this data to bolster their influence campaigns to
U||interfere in U.S. electoral processes. Criminal organizations could use this data to build profiles
U||on and subsequently target prosecutors and judges. Foreign intelligence organizations could
U||acquire this data through a variety of means—including through front companies that could
U||legally purchase the data from U.S. brokers and through simply hacking a data broker and
U||stealing it all—to build profiles on politicians, media figures, diplomats, civil servants, and even
U||suspected or secretly identified intelligence operatives.”
U||(U) We have not necessarily validated these examples with the IC, meaning that they should
U||not necessarily be taken as unresolved risks; but they illustrate the types of risk that CAI can
U||create in the hands of our adversaries.
U||2.6. (U) Sensitivity of CAI. CAI can reveal sensitive and intimate information about the personal
U||attributes, private behavior, social connections, and speech of U.S. persons and non-U.S.
U||persons. It can be misused to pry into private lives, ruin reputations, and cause emotional
U||distress and threaten the safety of individuals. Even subject to appropriate controls, CAI can
U||increase the power of the government’s ability to peer into private lives to levels that may
U||exceed our constitutional traditions or other social expectations. Mission creep can subject CAI
U||collected for one purpose to other purposes that might raise risks beyond those originally
U||calculated. The IC’s use of CAI is also the subject of intense scrutiny and speculation by political
U||leaders, the news media, and civil society.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||12
U||2.6.1. (U) CAI Includes Sensitive and Intimate Information. CAI can contain information that is
U||deemed sensitive, meaning information that is not widely known about an individual that could
U||be used to cause harm to the person’s reputation, emotional well-being, or physical safety. As a
U||primary justification for finding precise cell-site location information subject to Fourth
U||Amendment protection in Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), the Supreme
U||Court focused on how the “data provides an intimate window into a person’s life, revealing not
U||only his particular movements, but through them his ‘familial, political, professional, religious,
U||and sexual associations.’ These location records ‘hold for many Americans the ‘privacies of
U||life.’” Id. at 2217. CAI can also contain intimate information, meaning information that reveals
U||private details about how people relate to one another.
U||2.6.2. (U) Defining Sensitivity Categorically. Many statutes, rules, and privacy policies describe
U||information sensitivity categorically, listing types of information that tend to raise risks of harm.
U||To give a comparative example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
U||identifies as sensitive:
U||(U) personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
U||philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership., and the processing of genetic data,
U||biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning
U||health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
U||(U) Similarly, an internal data call from ODNI listed several categories of CAI as potentially
U||sensitive, including:
U||(U) persistent location information, medical (to include mental health) information,
U||travel records, attorney-client information, information concerning … religion or
U||religious practices, information containing data on sexual activity, records regarding
U||purchases, library records [as well as information] regarding individuals’
U||communications [metadata and content] [and] information concerning individuals’
U||expression of ideas or political views or the groups or individuals with whom they
U||associate.
U||2.6.3. (U//FOUO) CAI Can Be Misused. Studies document the extent to which large collections
U||of sensitive and intimate information about individuals, CAI or not, can be subject to abuse.
U||Documented examples of LOVEINT abuses (government officials spying on actual or potential
U||romantic partners) involving other intelligence collections demonstrate the potential for
U||comparable abuse of CAI held by the IC. In the wrong hands, sensitive insights gained through
U||CAI could facilitate blackmail, stalking, harassment, and public shaming. Concerns like these are
U||why, as detailed in Part 4, several IC elements require a “volume, proportion, and sensitivity”
U||analysis of certain data practices that considers, among other things, the “potential for
U||substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to U.S. persons if the
U||information is improperly used or disclosed.”
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||13
U||2.6.4. (U) CAI Increases the Power of the Government. The government would never have been
U||permitted to compel billions of people to carry location tracking devices on their persons at all
U||times, to log and track most of their social interactions, or to keep flawless records of all their
U||reading habits. Yet smartphones, connected cars, web tracking technologies, the Internet of
U||Things, and other innovations have had this effect without government participation. While the
U||IC cannot willingly blind itself to this information, it must appreciate how unfettered access to
U||CAI increases its power in ways that may exceed our constitutional traditions or other societal
U||expectations.
U||(U) CAI also implicates civil liberties. CAI can disclose, for example, the detailed movements and
U||associations of individuals and groups, revealing political, religious, travel, and speech activities.
U||CAI could be used, for example, to identify every person who attended a protest or rally based
U||on their smartphone location or ad-tracking records. Civil liberties concerns such as these are
U||examples of how large quantities of nominally “public” information can result in sensitive
U||aggregations.
U||2.6.5. (U) Aggregation of CAI Raise the Risk of Mission Creep. CAI collected for one purpose may
U||be reused for other purposes. An assessment of the risk to privacy of data collected at one
U||point in time may differ materially from a reassessment of the risk as applied to new purposes.
U||2.6.6. (U) Public, Media, and Political Scrutiny. The public seems to care about the risk to
U||personal privacy posed by the accumulation and sale of personal information by online
U||platforms, smartphone apps, connected devices, and other commercial entities. A steady string
U||of public controversies including Cambridge Analytica, the revelations by the New York Times
U||about data brokers that sell location information, the use of app usage data to identify a priest
U||who was using the Grindr app, and the revelation of the sale of usage data by a Muslim prayer
U||app, among many other examples, demonstrate the keen interest in CAI, at least on the part of
U||the media, civil society groups, and political leaders. The possible future revelation that any
U||component of the IC has gathered CAI without a proper accounting for the costs and benefits
U||raises the risk of significant media attention and political fallout and could jeopardize other
U||forms of CAI collection and use.
U||2.6.7. (U) Need for Thoughtful Approach. None of this is to suggest that CAI should be
U||categorically off-limits to the IC; the CAI that we address is publicly available, including to
U||friendly and adversarial foreign governments (and their intelligence services), non-
U||governmental organizations, commercial entities of many kinds, and individuals. It is only to say
U||that the privacy and civil liberties concerns that underlie judicial decisions like Carpenter, and
U||possible legislation restricting access to CAI, are real and important, and that the IC should
U||therefore take responsibility to develop a thoughtful and balanced approach in this area.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||14
U||(U) As noted above, we think it is insufficient as a matter of policy to treat all CAI as PAI,
U||without more, because modern CAI is so different from traditional PAI. Today’s CAI is more
U||revealing, available on more people (in bulk), less possible to avoid, and less well understood
U||than traditional PAI. It is only a little oversimplified to say that when Executive Order 12333 was
U||adopted, U.S. persons generally understood that the White Pages and the New York Times were
U||public, but also understood that it was possible to choose an unpublished telephone number
U||and (usually) to keep oneself out of the newspaper. Today, in a way that far fewer Americans
U||seem to understand, and even fewer of them can avoid, CAI includes information on nearly
U||everyone that is of a type and level of sensitivity that historically could have been obtained, if at
U||all, only through targeted (and predicated) collection. As a matter of policy, therefore, asserting
U||that modern CAI is materially indistinguishable from traditional PAI “is like saying a ride on
U||horseback is materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon.” Riley v. California, 573 U.S.
U||373, 393 (2014). These new qualitative and quantitative aspects of CAI, particularly of or
U||concerning U.S. persons and as discussed in Section 4.3.4, are key sensitivity concerns that
U||animate the need for a new approach.
U||2.7. (U) Summary. We have no doubt that CAI can provide significant intelligence value, both to
U||the IC and to our adversaries, whether standing alone or in combination with other information
U||that is collected using classified sources and methods, and whether analyzed by humans and/or
U||by machines. It also clearly raises significant issues of privacy and sensitivity, including for U.S.
U||persons. CAI is a relatively new, rapidly growing, and increasingly significant part of the
U||information environment in which the IC must function. That is the core of why this report is
U||necessary.

U||15
U||3. (U) THE EXISTING POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR CAI
U||(U) Under the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and IC elements’ internal procedures, CAI is
U||generally less strictly regulated than other forms of information acquired by the IC, principally
U||because it is publicly available. In our view, however, changes in CAI have considerably
U||undermined the historical policy rationale for treating PAI categorically as non-sensitive
U||information, that the IC can use without significantly affecting the privacy and civil liberties of
U||U.S. persons. For example, under Carpenter v. United States, acquisition of persistent location
U||information (and perhaps other detailed information) concerning one person by law
U||enforcement from communications providers is a Fourth Amendment “search” that generally
U||requires probable cause. However, the same type of information on millions of Americans is
U||openly for sale to the general public. As such, IC policies treat the information as PAI and IC
U||elements can purchase it. While IC policies regulate such information based on the volume,
U||proportion and sensitivity of USPI it contains, those policies may not accord sufficient protection
U||to information that is now broadly understood to be sensitive. It is not sufficient as a matter of
U||policy simply to say that CAI is PAI; and saying so without more may be affirmatively confusing
U||to intelligence professionals.
U||3.1. (U) PAI. Historically, PAI has not been considered sensitive, as reflected in both U.S. law and
U||policy. In keeping with our TOR, we do not offer an independent legal analysis of this issue;
U||instead, we review the legal background governing PAI solely as context for our policy
U||discussion of CAI.
U||3.1.1. (U) Constitutional Provisions. As a general matter, under the Fourth Amendment, “[w]hat
U||a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of
U||Fourth Amendment protection.” Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967). To be sure,
U||more recent decisions, most notably Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018), raise
U||questions about the extent to which providing information to certain third parties can
U||extinguish a reasonable expectation of privacy in that information. In keeping with our TOR, we
U||do not attempt to answer those questions; it is enough for our purposes to recognize the
U||general rule that PAI is not deemed sensitive. To take an obvious example, the Justices’ signed
U||opinions in Carpenter are clearly not protected by the Fourth Amendment and are available in
U||searchable CAI data sets from Lexis, Westlaw, and other providers. Historically, PAI also
U||generally was not considered sensitive under the First Amendment; but PAI today, including
U||CAI, may implicate First Amendment rights.
U||3.1.2. (U) Federal Statutes. Resting on the constitutional understanding discussed above, many
U||federal statutes expressly decline to protect, and assume the absence of Fourth Amendment
U||protection for, PAI. The federal Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(g)(i), provides that it “shall not
U||be unlawful . . . for any person . . . to intercept or access an electronic communication made
U||through an electronic communication system that is configured so that such electronic
U||communication is readily accessible to the general public.” Similarly, the Foreign Intelligence
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||16
U||Surveillance Act defines “electronic surveillance” in ways that expressly incorporate Fourth
U||Amendment principles and law enforcement standards, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(f), and requires
U||“minimization” of “nonpublicly available information,” 50 U.S.C. § 1801(h). To be sure, the
U||Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, also places certain restrictions on the IC when it collects and
U||retrieves USPI, including when the USPI is also PAI. The IC must have clear authority and
U||mission need to collect this PAI; must provide a notice to the public about the collection
U||(system of records notices), and generally may not maintain a record describing how an
U||individual exercises First Amendment rights. Some PAI can include protected speech (e.g., social
U||media posts) or associational information, and the Privacy Act would need to be considered
U||before collecting such information.
U||3.1.3. (U) Pending Legislation. We are aware that there are federal legislative efforts underway
U||that might affect the treatment of CAI, at least as acquired by the IC or other governmental
U||entities. We do not express an opinion on the merits of any particular pending or contemplated
U||legislation, but as an institutional matter we believe that legislation could address policy
U||concerns with the current regulatory framework governing CAI.
U||3.1.4. (U) IC Policy. The foundational document governing the IC also treats PAI as relatively
U||unprotected. Section 2.3 of Executive Order 12333 authorizes IC elements “to collect, retain, or
U||dissemination information about U.S. persons” in accordance with procedures established by
U||the head of the IC element and the Attorney General, and provides that these procedures “shall
U||permit collection, retention, and dissemination of . . . [i]nformation that is publicly available or
U||collected with the consent of the person concerned.” The term “publicly available” is defined in
U||the procedures of several IC elements. For example, the procedures for the Central Intelligence
U||Agency (CIA) define “publicly available information” is as follows:
U||(U) [1] information that has been published or broadcast for public consumption, [2] is
U||available on request to the public, [3] is accessible online or otherwise to the public, [4]
U||is available to the public by subscription or purchase, [5] could be seen or heard by any
U||casual observer (but not amounting to physical surveillance), [6] is made available at a
U||meeting open to the public, or [7] is obtained by visiting any place or attending any
U||event that is open to the public.
U||(U) Information is publicly available only if it is made available to the CIA under
U||conditions or on terms generally applicable to the public. For example, certain
U||commercially acquired data may be considered publicly available if a non-U.S.
U||government person or corporation could acquire that same data in that same way from
U||that same commercial source; however, other commercial acquisitions of data may be
U||so tailored and specialized for government use, and unavailable to a similarly situated
U||private-sector purchaser, that the data cannot be considered publicly available.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||17
U||(U) CIA Guidelines § 12.20 (emphasis added). The corresponding guidance for DOD intelligence
U||elements adopts a similar definition and adds the clarification that “Publicly available
U||information includes information generally available to persons in a military community even
U||though the military community is not open to the civilian general public.” DOD Manual 5240.01
U||§§ 3.2.b and G-2 at page 53.
U||(U) Under Executive Order 12333, moreover, some IC elements are authorized to collect
U||information (mainly or exclusively) “overtly or through publicly available sources.” EO 12333 §§
U||1.7(i)-(j), 1.8, 1.9, 1.12(c). The expansion of PAI to include modern CAI is highly consequential
U||for the work of these IC elements.
U||3.1.5. (U) IC Guidance. In July 2011, ODNI issued Civil Liberties and Privacy Guidance for
U||Intelligence Community Professionals: Properly Obtaining and Using Publicly Available
U||Information. This guidance included a “shorthand, non-exhaustive list of factors to consider for
U||properly obtaining and using” PAI, including that the PAI is (1) available to the general public;
U||(2) lawfully obtained by the IC (e.g., if a hacker posts instructions on a blog for how to penetrate
U||a bank’s online security, the bank’s data does not become lawfully available as a result); (3) the
U||IC purchaser has complied with any requirements to disclose IC affiliation, which is often
U||addressed through guidelines on “undisclosed participation” and similar rules; (4) requirements
U||for U.S. person information, including as to purpose, retention, and dissemination, are met; and
U||(5) there are safeguards in place to ensure that the information is used in a manner that
U||satisfies IC standards for “information accuracy, quality, and reliability,” including those in ICD
U||203. Although this guidance is more than a decade old, we believe that it is valuable and could
U||be updated as discussed further below.
U||3.2. (U) CAI. As discussed above, the definition of PAI in modern IC guidelines includes CAI to
U||the extent that it “is available to the public by subscription or purchase.” That description
U||applies to much CAI, and as previously noted it is the focus of our report, to the exclusion of CAI
U||products that are available only to governments. As noted above, IC elements’ guidelines
U||recognize that while some CAI is PAI, other commercial acquisitions of data may be so tailored
U||and specialized for government use, and unavailable to a similarly situated private-sector
U||purchaser, that the data cannot be considered publicly available. Approaching the issue from
U||the other side, there are certain legal restrictions on providing CAI to the U.S. government as
U||opposed to other purchasers (see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2702(a)(3)), as well as potential limits on
U||those restrictions (see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(F)). In substantial part, however, CAI is available
U||to the IC much as it is to the general public, other private-sector entities and non-governmental
U||organizations (NGOs), and foreign governments.
U||3.3. (U) CAI Under IC Guidelines. As we understand it, here is the process, in the form of issues
U||and questions, that the CIA and DOD Attorney General guidelines (issued under Section 2.3 of
U||Executive Order 12333) prescribe for potential acquisition and treatment of CAI (other IC
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||18
U||elements have their own guidelines, some of which at this writing are in the process of being
U||revised).
U||3.3.1. (U) Authorized Purpose. This is required for all activity under the IC guidelines. For
U||example, as a general matter, the CIA may collect information, including information
U||concerning U.S. persons and U.S. Person Identifying Information (USPI or USPII, depending on
U||the agency), only if the collection has “a purpose consistent with [lawful] CIA authorities and
U||responsibilities.” CIA Guidelines § 3.3. Similarly, as a general matter the DOD Manual permits
U||intentional acquisition of USPI “only if the information sought is reasonably believed to be
U||necessary for the performance of an authorized intelligence mission or function assigned to the
U||[DOD] Component” conducting the acquisition. DOD Manual § 3.2.c; see id. § 3.2.f(2). These
U||baseline requirements preclude, for example, intelligence collection for domestic political
U||purposes. See, e.g., CIA Guidelines § 3.3 (“CIA is not authorized to and shall not collect or
U||maintain information concerning U.S. persons solely for the purpose of monitoring (1) activities
U||protected by the First Amendment or (2) the lawful exercise of other rights secured by the
U||Constitution or laws of the United States … CIA is not authorized to and shall not engage in any
U||intelligence activity, including dissemination of information to the Executive Office of the
U||President, for the purpose of affecting the political process in the United States”); see also The
U||Attorney General’s Guidelines for Domestic FBI Operations. These limitations are themselves
U||derived from and consistent with Sections 2.3 and 2.4 of Executive Order 12333 and other
U||provisions of law.
U||3.3.2. (U) Publicly Available. Where the IC has an authorized intelligence purpose, and the
U||information it seeks is reasonably believed to be necessary for that purpose, it generally may
U||collect information, including USPI, if the information is publicly available. See, e.g., DOD
U||Manual § 3.2.c.(1); CIA Guidelines §§ 4.2(a), 4.21.
U||3.3.3. (U) Scope of Collection. The CIA’s guidelines permit the use of a collection technique
U||“only if a less intrusive technique cannot acquire intelligence of the nature, reliability, and
U||timeliness required,” and they treat collection of publicly available CIA as a “basic” collection
U||technique, generally the least intrusive category. CIA Guidelines §§ 4.1-4.2. However, the CIA
U||Guidelines also require (§ 3.3) that in “any collection activity, the CIA shall collect only the
U||amount of information reasonably necessary to support [an authorized] purpose.” Where a
U||collection exceeds the agency’s ability promptly to evaluate all of the collected information for
U||retention, the CIA guidelines require the approving official to document “the collection
U||technique(s) employed, including any reasonable steps that were or will be taken to limit the
U||information to the smallest separable subset of data containing the information necessary to
U||achieve the purpose of the collection,” such as the use of “filters or similar technology” that
U||“should be applied as early as practicable in the course of the collection activity.” Id. § 5.2(c).
U||The CIA Guidelines explicitly address and require additional documentation for bulk collection
U||(information collected without discriminants). See id. §§ 5, 12.2. The DOD Manual provides that
U||in addition to using the “least intrusive means” of collection, § 3.2.(f)(3)(a), “in collecting non-
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||19
U||publicly available USPI,” DOD components “will, to the extent practicable, collect no more
U||information than is reasonably necessary.” DOD Manual § 3.2.f.(3)(a), 3.2.f.(4). By its terms, this
U||last requirement does not apply to PAI, although DOD’s rules on the volume, proportionality,
U||and sensitivity (VPS) of USPI, discussed immediately below, do apply if the CAI includes USPI.
U||Current understandings of CAI as a subset of PAI mean that IC elements are essentially
U||encouraged to acquire CAI, when it is PAI, over other sources of information.
U||3.3.3.1. (U) Clarification of Current Guidelines. The IC may want to recalibrate, clarify or
U||consider its understanding of whether and how the preference for collection using the “least
U||intrusive means” relates to a preference to collect information that is necessary for an
U||authorized purpose. The increasing availability of CAI means that potentially sensitive
U||information on large numbers of persons may be PAI. In some cases, therefore, collecting a
U||large dataset using commercial means might invade privacy more than a narrower collection
U||using means that target a specific individual or smaller group. New guidance from some IC
U||elements addresses some of these issues (see, e.g., discussion of DIA procedures below).
U||3.3.4. (U) Volume, Proportion, Sensitivity (VPS) of USPI. The DOD Manual defines a category
U||known as “Special Circumstances Collection” according to the “volume, proportion, and
U||sensitivity of USPI likely to be acquired, and the intrusiveness of the methods used to collect
U||the information,” including when the information is PAI. DOD Manual § 3.2.e. When “special
U||circumstances exist, the DOD component head or delegee must determine whether to
U||authorize the collection and, if so, whether enhanced safeguards are appropriate.” Id. The CIA
U||Guidelines address “volume proportion, and sensitivity” of USPII in “exceptional handling
U||requirements” that apply to unevaluated data sets and might require “additional access
U||approvals or additional training requirements,” among other things. CIA Guidelines § 6.2. Some
U||IC elements have established, or are in the process of developing, more detailed VPS guidance,
U||as discussed in Part 4.
U||3.4. (U) CAI & Carpenter. Although to our knowledge the IC has not arrived at a community-
U||wide formal position on the issue, at least one IC element, the Defense Intelligence Agency
U||(DIA), has advised Congress in writing that, as of January 15, 2021, it “does not construe the
U||Carpenter decision to require a judicial warrant endorsing purchase or use of commercially-
U||available data for intelligence purposes.” We do not express a view on the legal merits of this
U||position, in keeping with our TOR, but in an effort to provide context for readers of this report,
U||we believe that it may rest on one or more of the following theories: (1) certain forms of CAI do
U||not implicate the privacy or Fourth Amendment rights of any data subject (e.g., topographical
U||maps); (2) some CAI involves data and other factors that bring the acquisition outside the scope
U||of Carpenter, meaning that normal third-party doctrine (e.g., United States v. Miller, 425 U.S.
U||435 (1976)) extinguishes any rights in the data subject; (3) for data types and acquisition modes
U||that are subject to Carpenter, the decision does not apply to the “special need” of intelligence
U||collection conducted by the IC; (4) even if Carpenter does apply, it would at most create a
U||shared Fourth Amendment interest among the data seller and the data subject, meaning that
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||20
U||the seller may consent unilaterally to sell the CAI, at least where the subject is not present and
U||objecting to the sale (e.g., United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164 (1974); Fernandez v.
U||California, 571 U.S. 292 (2014) – a consent-based Fourth Amendment doctrine that is
U||orthogonal to and unchanged by Carpenter.
U||(U//FOUO) At the same time, however, ODNI has taken the position in writing that, while
U||Carpenter’s reach remains uncertain, the IC will collect persistent location data under FISA’s
U||provisions requiring probable cause and applicable to collection of communications “contents”
U||rather than metadata, which is a clear effort to hedge against the possible application of
U||Carpenter to foreign intelligence collection. This is not meant to suggest internal legal
U||disagreement within the IC, but only to say that IC elements can and have made policy
U||judgments designed to hedge against the possibility that Carpenter applies beyond its facts, or
U||otherwise to address the concerns that underlie it.

U||21
U||4. (U) RECOMMENDATIONS
U||(U//FOUO) We have three recommendations. First, the IC should develop a multi-layered
U||process to catalog, to the extent feasible, the CAI that IC elements acquire. This will be a
U||complex undertaking requiring attention to procurement contracts, functionally equivalent data
U||acquisition processes, data flows, and data use. The IC cannot understand and improve how it
U||deals with CAI unless and until it knows what it is doing with CAI. Second, based on that
U||knowledge, the IC should develop a set of adaptable standards and procedures for CAI,
U||governing and requiring regular re-evaluation of acquisition and other decisions. Third, as part
U||of this set of standards and procedures, and/or as a complement to it, the IC should develop
U||more precise sensitivity and privacy-protecting guidance for CAI. PAI is no longer a good proxy
U||for non-sensitive information; today, much CAI is very sensitive, and the IC therefore needs to
U||develop more refined approaches.
U||4.1. (U//FOUO) Recommendation #1: The IC Should Learn How It Acquires and Uses CAI. As
U||discussed in Part 1, changes in digital technology and related factors have created a large and
U||growing market for CAI that includes significant VPS of USPI but remains PAI under current IC
U||guidelines. CAI is very valuable as a source of intelligence insight and creates significant risks to
U||privacy. But the IC does not currently have sufficient visibility into its own acquisition and use of
U||CAI across its 18 elements. Accordingly, our first recommendation is for the IC to implement a
U||process that affords it better insight, on a going-forward basis, as to that acquisition and use.
U||4.1.1. (U//FOUO) The Value of Understanding. Given the increasing importance of CAI, and the
U||highly dynamic nature of available offerings and markets, the IC is rightly focused on
U||understanding its own collection and use of CAI. Insight gained from 18 IC elements could
U||inform community-wide best practices in several areas, including means and terms of
U||acquisition, analysis and other approaches to use and exploitation (e.g., increased awareness of
U||the intelligence value of CAI to the IC and to our adversaries), awareness of privacy and other
U||sensitivities, and applicable legal and policy rules and frameworks. Cf. ICD 501. Logically
U||inconsistent approaches to CAI (as opposed to mere differences in approach, which properly
U||may result from differences in mission, authorities, and other factors) can be found and
U||addressed. In addition, overseers will rightly pose questions about the IC’s approach to CAI, and
U||the IC should be able to answer those questions with high fidelity and confidence.
U||4.1.2. (U) Prospective Cataloguing Effort. For three main reasons, we recommend that the IC
U||pursue a forward-looking and recurring effort to understanding its own use of CAI. As part of
U||that process, of course, the IC will need to navigate security and counterintelligence concerns.
U||(U) First, prior retrospective data calls have not fully succeeded. An attempt from the beginning
U||of 2021 did not return comprehensive and reliable results, and – in part for that reason – the
U||data call underlying our report sought only representative samples of CAI. That data call has
U||served us well, and when combined with insights from our discussions with IC elements we
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||22
U||believe it provides a suitable foundation for our report and recommendations. Our report is
U||not, however, based on anything approaching a complete survey of the use of CAI by the IC,
U||and difficulties in accessing historical information about the use of CAI informs our
U||recommendation for a new, forward-looking approach. Depending on what is revealed by that
U||forward-looking approach, significant new work may be required. For example, as noted
U||throughout this report, our report addresses CAI that is publicly available; if it turns out to be
U||the case that the IC acquires and uses a significant amount of CAI that is not PAI (e.g., because it
U||is sold only to governmental customers, not to the general public), then further analysis on that
U||issue probably would be necessary.
U||(U) Second, we believe that a prospective effort will be valuable. The IC’s acquisition and use of
U||CAI, as well as the overall market for CAI, is very dynamic, making a retrospective survey less
U||informative and useful for developing new approaches.
U||(U)Third, and relatedly, a forward-looking process that recurs could capture both current and
U||future states of affairs concerning CAI, allowing the IC to keep up with what we expect will be
U||significant developments over time.
U||4.1.3. (U) Multi-Layered Cataloguing Effort. We recommend that the IC’s forward-looking
U||process for cataloguing CAI be multi-layered.
U||(U) At the outset, the cataloguing effort should include formal contracts and procurement
U||decisions, as well as functionally equivalent agency-specific data acquisition processes, because
U||these will help identify CAI when it first arrives at (or becomes available to) an IC element. By
U||“functionally equivalent agency-specific data acquisition processes,” we mean to cover
U||acquisition of CAI that occurs without a formal procurement decision, such as when CAI is
U||provided (for ingestion or via a licensed right of access) to an IC element from a non-IC element,
U||including U.S. Title 10 elements, law enforcement, foreign governments, and non-governmental
U||organizations. These processes may vary from one IC element to another and over time within
U||an IC element. Even within an explicit procurement setting, the role of CAI may not always be
U||apparent – e.g., when a contract is for services, rather than for provisioning of CAI per se, but
U||the services in question require the use of CAI by the service-provider.
U||(U) Given these complexities in the acquisition of CAI, we also recommend that the IC focus
U||detection efforts at later stages of the information lifecycle, including in the process of planning
U||for and actually using data. We assess that this multi-layered approach is the best way
U||efficiently to begin capturing CAI acquisitions and use, including CAI acquired in bulk (or
U||otherwise in substantial amounts).
U||(U) In particular, key inputs to the cataloguing process may include (1) documentation
U||reflecting the purchase, license, or other acquisition of a CAI dataset; (2) audits by chief
U||information officers (CIOs) and chief data officers (CDOs) responsible for monitoring data flows
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||23
U||across agency systems and repositories; and (3) sourcing, citation and survey data from
U||collection officers and intelligence analysts reflecting the exploitation of specific CAI sources to
U||support tipping, queuing, finished intelligence (FINTEL), and other intelligence products.
U||(U) If the IC finds that it acquires CAI through mechanisms outside the scope of what we have
U||described in this report, then of course those mechanisms should be examined as well. Here, as
U||in the definition of CAI, attempts to describe a formal scope of effort should not obscure the
U||functional focus on gaining the best possible understanding of the CAI that is actually being
U||acquired and used by the IC.
U||4.1.4. (U) Common Taxonomy and Understanding. A central goal of the forward-looking process
U||should be to develop an IC-wide common taxonomy and understanding of CAI, to permit
U||meaningful comparisons and analysis at the scale of current and anticipated future CAI
U||operations. Of course, different IC elements will naturally and rightly adopt different standards
U||and procedures for CAI, according to their missions, authorities, need for CAI (and the
U||sensitivity and other attributes of the CAI they need), and other factors. But our assessment is
U||that current practices vary more, and more unsystematically, than is best. Put differently, the
U||IC’s approach to CAI so far has been mainly federated, with individual elements operating as
U||what might be called laboratories of CAI governance. Cf. New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285
U||U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). We think it is now time for the IC to assemble and
U||identify best practices from the range of current practice, addressing both operational and
U||risk/sensitivity frameworks, as discussed in our second and third recommendations, below.
U||4.2. (U) Recommendation #2: The IC Should Develop a Set of Adaptable Standards and
U||Procedures for CAI. The IC should adopt an end-to-end approach for CAI. The IC does not
U||currently have, and in our view should develop, a set of adaptable standards and procedures
U||for CAI that can be applied across the community. This can be done centrally, for the IC or the
U||Defense Intelligence Enterprise (DIE) as a whole, and/or at individual IC elements (where the
U||approaches could vary from one element to another as long as they are consistent in principle).
U||Either way, as the IC develops approaches to CAI, it will need to keep in mind IC elements’
U||authorities and needs, and the ways in which they approach related issues. There is a well-
U||understood tension, and need to balance, between consistency of approach across IC elements
U||for any single data type, and consistency of approach within an IC element for related data
U||types. We discuss immediately below the main issues of substance, structure, and process that
U||we recommend be included in CAI standards and procedures, and then review and assess
U||examples of such standards and procedures that are currently in effect at certain IC elements.
U||Our third recommendation, discussed further below, addresses the need for enhanced
U||sensitivity guidance for CAI, which overlaps in part with the issues discussed here.
U||4.2.1. (U) Issues. The IC should develop standards and procedures for CAI that address, among
U||other things, the following issues:
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||24
U||• (U) Mission Analysis to Identify Need/Value. What problem is the acquisition of CAI
U||designed to solve? How important is the problem, and how difficult is it to solve?
U||• (U) Fit Between Mission and CAI Data Set, Proposed Use. How will the CAI data set solve
U||or address the problem? What other possible approaches are there for addressing the
U||problem or meeting the need?
U||• (U) Vendor and Data Quality. This includes vendor capacity and longevity as well as
U||quality/reliability issues pertaining to the vendor and its data sources and personnel.
U||These factors may be more applicable to domestic commercial information acquisitions
U||than foreign acquisitions. Can the vendor reliably meet the IC element’s needs over
U||time? What assurances of quality are available? Can the vendor adapt if circumstances
U||or needs change?
U||• (U) Acquisition Mechanics. This includes where, how, and when CAI will be acquired;
U||whether it will be ingested or accessed at the vendor; whether acquisition is overt or
U||covert; whether USPI and other US data will be excluded at the vendor, at initial ingest
U||by the IC element, in query returns, and/or not at all. It also includes ways in which
U||acquisition mechanics may affect the IC’s ability to use the data towards the mission
U||need, including through the end user interface and application programming interfaces
U||(APIs) if applicable. The USA Freedom Act illustrates the importance of the policy and
U||engineering issues raised by acquisition mechanics.
U||• (U) Data Security. This involves potential counter-intelligence risk in the vendor and/or
U||the method of acquisition, and in data storage within the IC element (it overlaps to
U||some degree with the vendor and data quality review described above).
U||• (U) Sensitivity and Legal Review. This is focused on privacy protection and VPS of USPI
U||and addressed further in Recommendation #3 below.
U||• (U) Auditing Use of CAI. This involves keeping copies of queries and similar uses of the
U||CAI, and also finding ways to measure actual use and value over time.
U||• (U) Periodic Re-Evaluation. Finally, there should be a process to reconsider CAI
U||acquisition and other decisions, to avoid inertial automatic renewal of contracts, and to
U||take note when CAI data sources, or the use of CAI within the IC, change materially over
U||time. Cf. ICD 203 and ICD 206, and more general principles of information integrity
U||supporting standards of analytic tradecraft. In Recommendation #3, discussed below,
U||we address re-evaluation to address VPS and sensitivity issues, a similar process with a
U||different purpose than the re-evaluation discussed here.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||25
U||• (U) Other Structural and Procedural Issues. Some IC elements have a dedicated unit or
U||sub-unit focused on acquisition of CAI. Others have committees or working groups
U||drawn from personnel in relevant sub-units. Both approaches are potentially viable, but
U||IC elements should develop a regular process for addressing all of the issues listed above
U||in regular order and with the benefit of relevant personnel. Results of decisions should
U||be documented and provided to a central authority and assessed together periodically
U||to discern best practices.
U||4.2.2. (U) Examples of Current CAI Approaches. Several IC elements have established standards
U||and procedures to guide decisions on the acquisition and use of CAI. We review below the
U||approaches taken by three agencies (relevant source materials are in the appendices). Some IC
U||elements also have electronic Data Handling Forms (or the equivalent) governing acquisition of
U||CAI that helpfully standardize aspects of the process for making CAI procurement decisions (or
U||their functional equivalent).
U||4.2.2.1. (U) Treasury. The Treasury Department has chartered the Office of Terrorism and
U||Financial Intelligence Data Governance Board. We have three main observations on the charter.
U||First, the statement of objective and scope in Part B of the charter, and the statement of the
U||Board’s responsibilities in Part C, are general but broad enough to embrace the acquisition and
U||handling of CAI, and it is our understanding that they are applied to CAI. But they do not
U||explicitly apply to such acquisition and handling, and as Treasury advised, the Board was not
U||created to address CAI per se, but rather to facilitate data integration and information sharing
U||among all TFI components (one of which, OIA, is a member of the IC).
U||(U//FOUO) Second, while the Board allows for subject-matter experts to participate at the
U||Chair’s discretion under Part D.8 of the charter, the Board’s regular members do not include
U||representatives from privacy/civil liberties, which means that it may not be well positioned to
U||address issues including VPS. We understand that privacy experts are, at least in some cases,
U||invited to the Board’s sessions, and Treasury has advised that privacy considerations do factor
U||into the board’s decision.
U||(U) Third, while the Board has an objective and responsibilities, it does not appear to have any
U||explicit authority over CAI or other matters.
U||4.2.2.2. (U) Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Like the Treasury Department’s Data
U||Governance Board charter, the charter for the DHS Data Access Review Council (DARC) could be
U||adapted explicitly to address issues with CAI, and it is our understanding that DHS currently
U||uses the DARC to review bulk CAI acquisitions.
U||(U) The DARC’s members explicitly include representatives from DHS legal, policy, privacy and
U||civil liberties elements.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||26
U||(U//FOUO) The DARC charter calls for “automatic review” in cases involving an internal or
U||external “bulk data transfer” of PII, and “discretionary review” of other transfers upon the
U||nomination of any DARC member with concurrence of other members, unless the transfer in
U||question has already been approved by higher authority after a review for “legal and policy
U||sufficiency and privacy and civil rights and civil liberties adequacy.”
U||(U//FOUO) Highlighting an issue about common use of vocabulary across IC elements, the DARC
U||charter uses “bulk data transfer” to refer to the transfer of “large quantities of intelligence or
U||information, a significant portion of which is not reasonably likely to have any ultimate
U||intelligence or operational value to the recipient.” This is similar to how CIA defines and treats
U||“unevaluated data” (see CIA Guidelines §§ 12.22 (definition) and 6.2 (rules)), as discussed
U||above.
U||4.2.2.3. (U) The most mature set of standards and processes governing CAI that we
U||reviewed came from
U||(U) Among the documents we saw, these best represent the kind of end-to-end
U||process for CAI that we think is desirable.
U||4.2.3. (U) Assessment of CAI Examples. As the foregoing examples show, there is considerable
U||variation in the approaches to CAI that are currently in effect at IC elements. Some of this
U||variation makes sense in light of varying missions, authorities, and uses for CAI, and much of it
U||is explainable in light of differences in historical experience with CAI. The use of PAI in general,
U||and of CAI in particular, that includes detailed information concerning large numbers of
U||individuals is a relatively new intelligence discipline and still evolving rapidly. We certainly do
U||not mean to say that every IC element must adopt a version of very detailed procedures.
U||As noted above, however, we think that IC elements should now come together, review best
U||practices and approaches, and adopt standards that reflect their collective experience, as well
U||as the recommendations in this report. We believe that such an effort will result in more
U||uniform (albeit not identical) approaches to CAI across the IC.
U||(U) Almost all of the IC elements’ acquisition procedures governing CAI that we reviewed are
U||focused on operational and counter-intelligence concerns rather than privacy and sensitivity. To
U||be sure, some of the procedures focus on governance and include legal personnel in decision-
U||making, and some make explicit reference to civil liberties and legal review. But the documents
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||27
U||memorializing approaches to CAI do not address privacy and sensitivity with the same level of
U||rigor and focus that they devote to other issues. That leads to our third and final
U||recommendation.
U||4.3. (U) Recommendation #3: The IC Should Develop More Precise Sensitivity (VPS) Guidance
U||for CAI. As noted above, CAI can include sensitive information with a high volume, proportion,
U||and sensitivity (VPS) of USPI. Many IC elements’ guidelines have provisions that are designed to
U||address VPS concerns in the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of information, including
U||but not limited to CAI. We think those VPS provisions are sound and point in the right direction.
U||As set forth in IC guidelines, however, the VPS provisions are general, in the sense that they
U||afford considerable discretion both on when they apply and how they apply (e.g., what they
U||require to protect privacy). We believe that the IC should develop guidance that refines and
U||applies VPS standards more precisely and explicitly to CAI. Again, the guidance and approach
U||need not be identical at each IC element. We discuss immediately below the main issues of
U||structure, process, and substance that we recommend be included in the guidance, and then
U||review and assess three examples of VPS guidance that are currently in effect (or in
U||development) at certain IC elements. Some of the issues discussed here overlap with our
U||second recommendation, discussed above.
U||4.3.1. (U) Structural and Procedural Issues. In developing VPS guidance for CAI, IC elements
U||should consider, among other things, the following structural and procedural issues:
U||• (U) Required involvement of relevant parties at all stages, for the most sensitive cases
U||including legal, privacy, and civil liberties personnel within IC elements.
U||• (U) VPS assessments generally being made prior to acquisition, or at least prior to
U||analytic use of CAI (with a traditional emergency exception allowing prompt post-
U||acquisition assessing and reporting, with an adequate explanation), ideally integrated or
U||coordinated with CAI acquisition reviews discussed in Recommendation #2 (to avoid VPS
U||concerns being raised as an afterthought or too late in the process).
U||• (U) Approval requirements, with higher levels of approval required for more sensitive
U||cases, including the possibility of approvals by IC element heads in the most sensitive
U||cases.
U||• (U) Documentation, retention, and availability to relevant personnel of assessments,
U||approvals, and mitigation measures adopted, in keeping with need-to-know and related
U||security principles, to enhance institutional memory.
U||• (U) Re-evaluation of VPS assessments and measures, both on a regular basis (e.g.,
U||annually) and as circumstances change (e.g., in some cases where material, new
U||information sources are added by the vendor to a purchased CAI data set, or significant
U||SECRET/
U||SECRET//
U||28
U||new uses are found for previously collected CAI). In Recommendation #2, discussed
U||above, we address re-evaluation to address mission needs, a similar process with a
U||different purpose than the re-evaluation discussed here.
U||• (U) Forwarding of assessments and other documentation to ODNI (and/or other central
U||authorities, such as USDI or elsewhere in DOD), and a formal mechanism for periodic
U||review to allow comparisons and discussion of best practices across IC elements, to
U||inform refinements and other development of new guidance, consistent with need-to-
U||know and related security and counterintelligence requirements.
U||4.3.2. (U) Substantive Issues. Apart from the structural and procedural issues above, we
U||recommend that IC elements also consider the following substantive issues in developing VPS
U||guidance for CAI:
U||• (U) Sensitivity of the CAI – e.g., concerning protected constitutional rights (including
U||religion, speech, reading, association, and political activities), precise and persistent
U||location, sexual activity, and embarrassment and risk to USPs if CAI is disclosed, in
U||keeping with the discussion of sensitivity in Part 2 of this report. How do general VPS
U||principles apply in these specific contexts?
U||• (U) Deanonymization/reidentification issues. To what extent are data that have been
U||anonymized less sensitive if the IC element can, without undue difficulty, reverse the
U||anonymization or otherwise identify individuals?
U||• (U) Importance of mission served by CAI (to balance against sensitivity of CAI). IC
U||elements should conduct an explicit analysis and balance of sensitivity risks and mission
U||benefits.
U||• (U) Strength of nexus between CAI and mission, and availability, feasibility, costs, and
U||risks of (less intrusive) alternatives.
U||• (U) Ability to filter USPI prior to ingestion (e.g., at the vendor or through an
U||intermediary, before it is made available for operational or analytic use at an IC
U||element), recognizing that because the USIC is very likely the only consumer of CAI that
U||would want or need to eschew USPI, this may be inconsistent with covert acquisition.
U||• (U) Traditional minimization approaches and techniques, including ability to acquire CAI
U||via access to data at the vendor rather than ingestion of data in bulk, limits on retention,
U||access, querying, other use, and dissemination of CAI, and possible requirements for
U||special training of relevant personal and auditing of queries and other uses of CAI.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||29
U||• (U) Availability of other privacy-protective measures in light of the need and anticipated
U||use of CAI (e.g., masking, differential privacy techniques, homomorphic or other forms
U||of encryption) that may not be available or appropriate for all missions and anticipated
U||uses.
U||4.3.3. (U) Examples of VPS Guidance. Several IC elements have established, or are developing,
U||more refined VPS guidance, including for use with CAI. These efforts also represent a step in the
U||right direction. We review below the approaches taken by three agencies (relevant source
U||materials are in the appendices).
U||4.3.3.1. (U) DIA. The Defense Intelligence Agency published Procedures for Special
U||Circumstances Collection in DIA Guide 5148.1-2 (February 23, 2021). These procedures provide
U||“guidance to DIA personnel for evaluating whether a collection opportunity should be
U||considered a special circumstances collection.” Id. § 2. Where a special circumstances collection
U||is found and authorized, “the collecting DIA element in consultation with [the DIA Office of
U||Oversight and Compliance] must also consider whether enhanced safeguards are required to
U||protect access to the information.” Id. § 4.3. Apart from legal and policy restrictions, the
U||following factors are to be considered (id. §§ 4.3.1-4.3.5, sub-section numbering omitted):
U||• (U) Civil liberties and privacy implications of the collection;
U||• (U) Potential for substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to U.S.
U||persons if the information is improperly used or disclosed;
U||• (U) Potential future use of the information being retained and the types of queries or
U||searches expected to be conducted;
U||• (U) Length of time the information will be retained; and
U||• (U) Practical and technical difficulties associated with implementing any enhanced
U||safeguards.
U||(U) If enhanced safeguards are deemed necessary under these factors, one or more of the
U||following measures can be used (id. §§ 4.4.1-4.4.5, sub-section numbering omitted):
U||• (U) Procedures for approval for access to and audit of any searches;
U||• (U) Procedures to restrict access or dissemination including limiting the number of
U||personnel with access or authority to search; establishing a requirement for higher-level
U||approval or legal review before or after access or search; or requiring higher-level
U||approval or legal review before or after U.S. person information is unmasked or
U||disseminated;
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET/
U||30
U||• (U) Use of privacy-enhancing techniques, such as information masking that indicates the
U||existence of U.S. person information without providing the content of the information,
U||until the appropriate approvals are granted;
U||• (U) Use of access controls, including data segregation, attribute-based access, or other
U||physical or logical access methods;
U||• (U) Additional protective retention measures or training as required.
U||(U) Before collection occurs (or as soon as possible after it begins, with an explanation of why
U||collection began before authorization and why continued retention of any previously collected
U||information should be authorized), the “DIA collecting element routes a written summary of
U||the results of its evaluation in paragraphs 4.2 through 4.4 … in a staff package to the
U||appropriate delegated decision authority.” Id. § 5. The package is then coordinated with the
U||Office of General Counsel and other appropriate DIA elements. Id. If and when collection is
U||approved, OOC notifies the DOD Senior Intelligence Oversight Officer. Id. § 6.2.
U||(U) In addition to agency-specific guidance, it is our understanding that DOD is nearing
U||completion of a Department-wide policy on enhanced safeguards which will impose restrictions
U||on the use of certain sensitive forms of CAI.
U||4.3.3.2. (U//FOUO) NSA. The National Security Agency (NSA) adopted NSA/CSS Policy
U||Memorandum 2021-01, Special Circumstances: Guidance for Intelligence Collection of U.S.
U||Person Information, effective for a one-year period beginning March 10, 2021. The NSA memo
U||resembles the DIA Guidance in that it “prescribes the implementation of NSA/CSS procedures
U||for considering whether an intelligence collection opportunity may constitute Special
U||Circumstances Collection requiring enhanced safeguards under paragraph 3.2.e. of” the DOD
U||Manual. NSA Memo ¶ 1. Covered collection opportunities under the NSA memo expressly
U||include those involving information that is “commercially acquired or voluntarily provided,” as
U||well as SIGINT, whenever the information in question “is to be retained in a repository for
U||operational purposes.” Id. ¶¶ 1-2. The NSA memo expressly does not apply to “collection
U||decisions regarding individual foreign intelligence targets,” as opposed to, e.g., collection of
U||unevaluated or bulk data; “nor does it apply to analyst queries or disseminations of lawfully
U||collected intelligence information,” or to efforts under NSD 42 to secure U.S. government
U||systems (see DOD Manual § 3.1.a.(3)). Id. ¶¶ 1-2. The NSA memo explains that it is not a
U||substitute for consultation with NSA lawyers. Id. ¶ 3. All approved Special Circumstances
U||collections are to be reported annually to DOD. Id. ¶ 10.
U||(U//FOUO) Under the NSA memo, an element of NSA/CSS that is “considering an intelligence
U||collection opportunity” must generally conduct a “Special Circumstances Collection
U||Assessment” (SCCA) “to determine whether [the collection opportunity] includes the
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||31
U||acquisition of USPI that raises special circumstances.” Id. ¶ 11. In general, NSA’s guidance
U||emphasizes measures that prevent such acquisition, by requiring that to “the extent
U||practicable, before collection … organizations will reduce the risk of acquiring USPI that is not
U||responsive to the [mission] purposes of the collection.” Id. ¶ 18. The NSA memo explains that
U||“post-collection mitigations do not affect” whether special circumstances are found to exist,
U||but “may affect the appropriate decision level for approval of Special Circumstances
U||Collection.” Id. It is clear that NSA would prefer to filter out unnecessary USPI before collection,
U||a laudable goal.
U||(U) Where USPI cannot be filtered before collection, an SCCA is generally required with respect
U||to CAI and other non-SIGINT collection opportunities but is expressly not required in four
U||defined situations (id. ¶ 13.b.):
U||1) (U) The collection is limited to data or information that is not reasonably anticipated
U||to include USPI, such as statistics or machine-to-machine data (e.g., network
U||infrastructure interactions, netflow, internet routing information);
U||2) (U) The collection is limited to data or information that is available to the public at
U||large (e.g., telephone listings, technical journals, newspapers, and books), provided that
U||such collection is not reasonably anticipated to include information concerning USPs
U||resulting from negligence or theft (e.g., hacked or stolen data) and is also not reasonably
U||anticipated to include highly sensitive USPI as further described in paragraph 15;
U||3) (U) The collection is provided with consent of an individual or organization in
U||accordance with [the DOD Manual]; or
U||4) (U) The collection is not expected to include USPI or is not otherwise governed by
U||[the DOD Manual].
U||(U) The first two of these four exclusions raise significant questions centered on the application
U||and meaning of the definition of USPI.
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||32
U||(U//FOUO) The second exclusion depends largely on how NSA applies the definition of USPI to
U||(publicly available) CAI. The second exclusion generally covers such CAI because it applies to
U||“information that is available to the public at large,” including by paid subscription, but it
U||expressly does not include CAI that is “highly sensitive” as defined in paragraph 15. Thus, under
U||Paragraph 13.b. of the NSA memo, an SCCA is required for the collection of “highly sensitive”
U||CAI (that is not subject to the other exclusions).
U||(U) The definition of “highly sensitive” in paragraph 15 of the NSA memo refers back to the VPS
U||definition of “special circumstances” in the DOD Manual but develops further the meaning of
U||“sensitivity.” Paragraph 15 explains that the “sensitivity of USPI” depends on “the potential for
U||substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any USP if the information is
U||improperly used or disclosed,” which is very similar to Section 4.3.2. of the DIA Guidance
U||discussed above, and relevant to some of the concerns raised in Part 2 of this report. Paragraph
U||15.b.1. of the NSA memo goes on to provide:
U||(U) Special circumstances exist if the type of information to be collected relates to or
U||aggregates many data types concerning sensitive activities of any identifiable USP.
U||Sensitive activities include political participation, practice of religion, medical
U||information, membership or participation in organizations or associations, financial
U||data, protected speech, location over time, and protected class demographics. Special
U||circumstances also include publicly available data concerning identifiable USPs that the
U||originator did not intend to be made accessible online or otherwise available to the
U||public (e.g., hacked or stolen data).
U||(U) Standing alone, this language in Paragraph 15.b.1. appears to mean that an SCCA is
U||required, and that sensitive circumstances exist, when NSA collects (a significant volume of) CAI
U||that is “sensitive,” hacked, or stolen USPI (and that is not subject to the other exclusions in
U||paragraph 13.b.).
U||(U//FOUO) Under paragraph 15.b.2., special circumstances “do not exist if the type of
U||information to be collected is limited to USPI that people have chosen to share publicly about
U||themselves, unless such information relates to the sensitive activities of any identifiable USP as
U||further addressed above.” As we understand it, NSA does not consider metadata associated
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||33
U||with app downloads or website visits to be data that “people have chosen to share publicly
U||about themselves” within the meaning of this provision. In any case, even if that were not so,
U||paragraph 15.b.2. would require an SCCA, and sensitive circumstances would exist, when NSA
U||collects CAI that includes “sensitive,” hacked, or stolen USPI or that relates to an identifiable
U||USP (again assuming the other exclusions in Paragraph 13.b. do not apply). We are not aware of
U||any further guidance from NSA on this question, although as noted above it is our
U||understanding that NSA is currently working to institute additional compliance guidance
U||regarding the handling of publicly available information. We think it may be helpful for such
U||forthcoming guidance to address these issues explicitly.
U||(U//FOUO) Netting out the many layers of guidance in NSA’s memo, as we understand it, much
U||turns on whether information, including “sensitive” CAI, is “USPI” (or information that “relates”
U||to “any identifiable USP”). As discussed above, the first exclusion in Paragraph 13.b. turns
U||expressly on whether machine-to-machine data is determined to contain USPI (and again, our
U||understanding from NSA is that it does not). And the second exclusion ultimately turns on a
U||similar question under paragraph 15.b.1.-2. We believe that further guidance is needed on both
U||issues, and as noted above it may be currently in development.
U||4.3.3.3. (U//FOUO) CIA. As of this writing, CIA is in the process of developing principles to
U||govern the acquisition and use of commercial data.
U||(U//FOUO)

U||34
U||(U//FOUO)
U||(U) 4.3.4. Assessment of VPS Examples and Possible Areas of Future Focus . We appreciate and
U||support the effort reflected in the examples reviewed above from DIA, NSA, and CIA. Although
U||VPS guidance for CAI should follow from VPS guidance in general, we believe that CAI presents
U||a sufficiently significant and growing phenomenon to merit specific guidance, as CIA is currently
U||developing in its principles. We support the processes for assessments and approvals in the
U||guidance from DIA and NSA and believe that CIA should develop a similar approach to ensure
U||the proper application of its CAI principles. Although it has made progress, particularly with
U||respect to bulk (or bulky) collection of CAI, further progress needs to be made in developing
U||visibility into and control of the channels through which CIA acquires CAI.
U||(U) The single most important point, in our view, is that the existing VPS-CAI guidance should be
U||further developed, ideally with examples illustrating the application of standards to cases. We
U||offer four specific areas, drawn from the longer list above, in which such development would be
U||particularly helpful.
U||(U) First, some IC elements seem to be
U||embracing a relatively binary model, in which CAI is non-sensitive if the government could
U||and/or historically did overtly and lawfully acquire it directly, and sensitive if the government
U||could not or historically did not do so. Cf. Part 2 of this report. In the former category, for
U||example, would be a database of newspaper and magazine articles, while the latter category
U||would include bulk, persistent cell site location information (CSLI), which would normally
U||require a warrant (under Carpenter), or . This
U||binary model may not satisfactorily classify every possible case involving CAI, but it appears to
U||be at least a good beginning. (As noted above, a third category of CAI, that is not PAI at all
U||because it is available only to governments, is beyond the scope of this report, but worthy of
U||further attention in its own right.) We recommend the IC test and refine the model against the
U||known use cases to develop guidance. Cf. DOD 3115.12 (2010). The basic point is that the
U||qualitative nature of CAI may help determine its sensitivity.
U||(U) Second, in addition to qualitative differences in CAI, quantitative differences are also
U||relevant. CAI that is acquired in bulk will almost always be more sensitive than CAI in smaller
U||data sets. Where bulk acquisition can be avoided, and the volume of acquired data is reduced,
U||it is generally helpful both for intelligence purposes and for the protection of privacy and civil
U||liberties, and it may simplify CAI procedures.
U||SECRET/
U||SECRET//
U||35
U||(U) Third, subject to the policy concerns underlying PPD-28’s approach to SIGINT, U.S.
U||intelligence law and policy emphasize the protection of USPI, and approaches to CAI should be
U||developed consistent with that emphasis. In general, foreign CAI data sets concerning foreign
U||persons and entities may raise fewer, or at least different, concerns than analogous data sets
U||focused on the United States and/or U.S. persons.
U||(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) Fourth, as discussed with respect to the NSA principles, the IC should
U||develop guidance on how the definition of USPI, and the definition of information that pertains
U||to a known USP, apply in the context of CTD and other CAI. If the New York Times can easily de-
U||anonymize persistent location data on U.S. persons, and similar efforts are possible and/or may
U||be undertaken by the IC for AdTech and other CAI, is the information therefore USPI? The
U||question arises, and the guidance is needed, because the term USPI is defined in IC policies as
U||“either a single item of information or information that, when combined with other
U||information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific U.S. persons,” with a
U||recognition that the definition as applied “in a particular context may require a case-by-case
U||assessment by a trained intelligence professional.” CIA Guidelines § 12.25; DOD Manual
U||5240.01 §§ 3.2, G-2. We noted inconsistencies between how different IC elements define and
U||treat USPI, with some treating data as non-USPI because they did not possess other data sets
U||that could be used to reidentify (deanonymize) or because they did not intend to reidentify the
U||individuals in the data. This strikes us as unacceptably narrow; at a minimum, the issue of
U||readily-available deanonymization should be considered closely and more precise guidance
U||provided in the context of CAI.
U||(U) Beyond these areas, we think that the IC also should at least begin working on assessing and
U||developing more specific guidance for various forms of existing or emerging CAI, including from
U||social media, biometrics, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), and the Internet of Things.
U||(U) Even if designed for specific areas, of course, this guidance should be consistent with the
U||principles discussed above.
U||(U//FOUO) We are agnostic as to whether the guidance should be set out in a stand-alone
U||document devoted to VPS issues in CAI added to broader CAI processes
U||(of the sort discussed in our second recommendation above), added as an amendment to
U||existing procedures governing intelligence activities of IC elements, or included in guidance
U||addressing VPS concerns in general (not limited to CAI). The main point is that the guidance be
U||sufficiently clear and specific.

U||5. (U) CONCLUSION
U||(U//FOUO) We tried, in Part 1 of this report, to describe CAI for those who are not already
U||familiar with it. Part 1 therefore included a working definition of CAI (and an explanation of why
U||it is important to define); a list of the main sellers of CAI and a brief description of the types of
U||information they make available; an effort to trace the origins and evolution of CAI in the rise of
U||digital data; and a review of how “anonymized” CAI can be reidentified and linked to
U||individuals.
U||(U) Part 2 explained why the DNI was right to commission our report. It described how CAI can
U||provide intelligence value and identified several examples of IC contracts for CAI. It also
U||addressed non-analytic uses of CAI and counter-intelligence risks in CAI, and the risks that CAI
U||presents for privacy and civil liberties. As we observed at the end of Part 2, CAI is a relatively
U||new, rapidly growing, and increasingly significant part of the information environment in which
U||the IC must function, deserving of focused attention.
U||(U) Part 3 reviewed in detail the current IC policy and regulatory framework governing CAI,
U||under which, as information that is available to the general public, it is treated as PAI. Part 3
U||tried to describe the current state of CAI regulation as a baseline for our recommendations.
U||(U) Part 4 set out our three main recommendations:
U||(U) First, the IC should develop a forward-looking and recurring process to catalog the
U||acquisition and use of CAI across its 18 elements. The IC cannot understand and improve how it
U||deals with CAI unless and until it knows what it is doing with CAI.
U||(U) Second, based on the knowledge gained from that process, the IC should develop a set of
U||adaptable standards and procedures for CAI, governing and requiring regular re-evaluation of
U||acquisition and other decisions. We offer several elements that can be included in those
U||standards and procedures, but also recognize that they will need to be adapted for different IC
U||elements with different CAI missions.
U||(U) Third, as part of this set of policies and procedures, and/or as a complement to it, the IC
U||should develop more precise sensitivity and privacy-protecting guidance for CAI. Again, we
U||offer several suggestions for the development of such guidance.
U||(U) If some or all of these recommendations are agreeable, the IC will need a mechanism for
U||putting them into effect, and for making any other changes suggested by continued attention
U||to CAI. One possibility, which we believe is worth considering, would be a traditional working
U||group of IC senior officials. This group would be charged with implementing our
U||recommendations (to the extent approved), sharing best practices, collecting and assessing
U||additional information about the IC’s use of CAI, and recommending additional improvements
U||SECRET//
U||SECRET//
U||37
U||over time. The group might decide to proceed within the framework of our three
U||recommendations, or it might adopt their substance within a different framework. For example,
U||the working group might focus on developing (1) principles, such as utility, privacy, and quality
U||of data; (2) tools and procedures for implementing those principles, such as technological
U||methods for filtering and limiting data before its ingestion or use; and (3) processes and
U||approval requirements for applying those tools and procedures. As noted above, CAI is both
U||increasingly powerful for intelligence and increasingly sensitive for individual privacy, and while
U||we hope that our 90-day report provides a helpful foundation for developing more refined
U||approaches, we believe that continued efforts will be necessary. We appreciate the opportunity
U||to be of service
