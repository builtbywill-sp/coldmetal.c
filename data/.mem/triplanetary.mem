U||                                  Triplanetary
U||By EDWARD E. SMITH, Ph.D.
U||   We are sure that our readers will be highly pleased to have us give the
U||   first installment of a story by Dr. Smith. It will continue for several
U||   numbers and is a worthy follower of the "Skylark" stories which were so
U||   much appreciated by our readers. We think that they will find this
U||   story superior to the earlier ones. Dr. Smith certainly has the
U||   narrative power, and that, joined with his scientific position, makes
U||   him an ideal author for our columns.

U||CHAPTER I
U||  Pirates of Space
U||   Apparently motionless to her passengers and crew, the Interplanetary
U||   liner Hyperion bored serenely onward through space at normal
U||   acceleration. In the railed-off sanctum in one corner of the control
U||   room a bell tinkled, a smothered whirr was heard, and Captain Bradley
U||   frowned as he studied the brief message upon the tape of the
U||   recorder--a message flashed to his desk from the operator's panel. He
U||   beckoned, and the second officer, whose watch it now was, read aloud:
U||   "Reports of scout patrols still negative."
U||   "Still negative." The officer scowled in thought. "They've already
U||   searched beyond the widest possible location of the wreckage, too. Two
U||   unexplained disappearances inside a month--first the Dione, then the
U||   Rhea--and not a plate nor a lifeboat recovered. Looks bad, sir. One
U||   might be an accident; two might possibly be a coincidence...." His
U||   voice died away. What might that coincidence mean?
U||   "But at three it would get to be a habit," the captain finished the
U||   thought. "And whatever happened, happened quick. Neither of them had
U||   time to say a word--their location recorders simply went dead. But of
U||   course they didn't have our detector screens nor our armament.
U||   According to the observatories we're in clear ether, but I wouldn't
U||   trust them from Tellus to Luna. You have given the new orders, of
U||   course?"
U||   "Yes, sir. Detectors full out, all three courses of defensive screen on
U||   the trips, projectors manned, suits on the hooks. Every object detected
U||   in the outer space to be investigated immediately--if vessels, they are
U||   to be warned to stay beyond extreme range. Anything entering the fourth
U||   zone is to be rayed."
U||   "Right--we are going through!"
U||   "But no known type of vessel could have made away with them without
U||   detection," the second officer argued. "I wonder if there isn't
U||   something in those wild rumors we've been hearing lately?"
U||   Now, systematically and precisely, the great Cone of Battle was coming
U||   into being; a formation developed during the Jovian Wars while the
U||   forces of the Three Planets were fighting in space.
U||   "Bah! Of course not!" snorted the captain. "Pirates in ships faster
U||   than light--fifth order rays--nullification of gravity--mass without
U||   inertia--ridiculous! Proved impossible, over and over again. No, sir,
U||   if pirates are operating in space--and it looks very much like it--they
U||   won't get far against a good big battery full of kilowatt-hours behind
U||   three courses of heavy screen, and a good solid set of multiplex rays.
U||   Properly used, they're good enough for anybody. Pirates, Neptunians,
U||   angels, or devils--in ships or on sunbeams--if they tackle the Hyperion
U||   we'll burn them out of the ether!"
U||   Leaving the captain's desk, the watch officer resumed his tour of duty.
U||   The six great lookout plates into which the alert observers peered were
U||   blank, their far-flung ultra-sensitive detector screens encountering no
U||   obstacle--the ether was empty for thousands upon thousands of
U||   kilometers. The signal lamps upon the pilot's panel were dark, its
U||   warning bells were silent. A brilliant point of white in the center of
U||   the pilot's closely ruled micrometer grating, exactly upon the
U||   cross-hairs of his directors, showed that the immense vessel was
U||   precisely upon the calculated course, as laid down by the automatic
U||   integrating course-plotters. Everything was quiet and in order.
U||   "All's well, sir," he reported briefly to Captain Bradley--but all was
U||   not well.
U||   Danger--more serious far in that it was not external--was even then,
U||   all unsuspected, gnawing at the great ship's vitals. In a locked and
U||   shielded compartment, deep down in the interior of the liner, was the
U||   great air purifier. Now a man leaned against the primary duct--the
U||   aorta through which flowed the stream of pure air supplying the entire
U||   vessel. This man, grotesque in full panoply of space armor, leaned
U||   against the duct, and as he leaned a drill bit deeper and deeper into
U||   the steel wall of the pipe. Soon it broke through, and the slight rush
U||   of air was stopped by the insertion of a tightly fitting rubber tube.
U||   The tube terminated in a heavy rubber balloon, which surrounded a frail
U||   glass bulb. The man stood tense, one hand holding before his
U||   silica-and-steel helmeted head a large pocket chronometer, the other
U||   lightly grasping the balloon. A sneering grin was upon his face as he
U||   awaited the exact second of action--the carefully pre-determined
U||   instant when his right hand, closing, would shatter the fragile flask
U||   and force its contents into the primary air stream of the Hyperion!
U||   Far above, in the main saloon, the regular evening dance was in full
U||   swing. The ship's orchestra crashed into silence, there was a patter of
U||   applause and Clio Marsden, radiant belle of the voyage, led her partner
U||   out into the promenade and up to one of the observation plates.
U||   "Oh, we can't see the earth any more!" she exclaimed. "Which way do you
U||   turn this, Mr. Costigan?"
U||   "Like this," and Conway Costigan, burly young first officer of the
U||   liner, turned the dials. "There--this plate is looking back, or down,
U||   at Tellus; this other one is looking ahead."
U||   Earth was a brilliantly shining crescent far beneath the flying vessel.
U||   Above her, ruddy Mars and silvery Jupiter blazed in splendor ineffable
U||   against a background of utterly indescribable blackness--a background
U||   thickly besprinkled with dimensionless points of dazzling brilliance
U||   which were the stars.
U||   "Oh, isn't it wonderful!" breathed the girl, awed. "Of course, I
U||   suppose that it's old stuff to you, but I--a ground-gripper, you know,
U||   and I could look at it forever, I think. That's why I want to come out
U||   here after every dance. You know, I ..."
U||   Her voice broke off suddenly, with a queer, rasping catch, as she
U||   seized his arm in a frantic clutch and as quickly went limp. He stared
U||   at her sharply, and understood instantly the message written in her
U||   eyes--eyes now enlarged, staring hard, brilliant, and full of
U||   soul-searing terror as she slumped down, helpless but for his support.
U||   In the act of exhaling as he was, lungs almost entirely empty, yet he
U||   held his breath until he had seized the microphone from his belt and
U||   had snapped the lever to "emergency."
U||   "Control room!" he gasped then, and every speaker throughout the great
U||   cruiser of the void blared out the warning as he forced his already
U||   evacuated lungs to absolute emptiness. "Vee-Two Gas! Get tight!"
U||   Writhing and twisting in his fierce struggle to keep his lungs from
U||   gulping in a draft of that noxious atmosphere, and with the unconscious
U||   form of the girl draped limply over his left arm, Costigan leaped
U||   toward the portal of the nearest lifeboat. Orchestra instruments
U||   crashed to the floor and dancing couples fell and sprawled inertly
U||   while the tortured First Officer swung the door of the lifeboat open
U||   and dashed across the tiny room to the air-valves. Throwing them wide
U||   open, he put his mouth to the orifice and let his laboring lungs gasp
U||   their eager fill of the cold blast roaring from the tanks. Then,
U||   air-hunger partially assuaged, he again held his breath, broke open the
U||   emergency locker, donned one of the space-suits always kept there, and
U||   opened its valves wide in order to flush out of his uniform any
U||   lingering trace of the lethal gas.
U||   He then leaped back to his companion. Shutting off the air, he released
U||   a stream of pure oxygen, held her face in it, and made shift to force
U||   some of it into her lungs by compressing and releasing her chest
U||   against his own body. Soon she drew a spasmodic breath, choking and
U||   coughing, and he again changed the gaseous stream to one of pure air,
U||   speaking urgently as she showed signs of returning consciousness. Now,
U||   it was Clio Marsden's life.
U||   "Stand up!" he snapped. "Hang onto this brace and keep your face in
U||   this air-stream until I get a suit around you! Got me?"
U||   She nodded weakly, and, assured that she could now hold herself at the
U||   valve, it was the work of only a minute to encase her in one of the
U||   protective coverings. Then, as she sat upon a bench, recovering her
U||   strength, he flipped on the lifeboat's visiphone projector and shot its
U||   invisible beam up into the control room, where he saw space-armored
U||   figures furiously busy at the panels.
U||   "Dirty work at the cross-roads!" he blazed to his captain, man to
U||   man--formality disregarded, as it so often was in the Triplanetary
U||   service. "There's skulduggery afoot somewhere in our primary air! Maybe
U||   that's the way they got those other two ships--pirates! Might have been
U||   a timed bomb--don't see how anybody could have stowed away down there
U||   through the inspections, and nobody but Franklin can neutralize the
U||   shield of the air-room--but I'm going to look around, anyway. Then I'll
U||   join you fellows up there."
U||   "What was it?" the shaken girl asked. "I think that I remember your
U||   saying 'Vee-Two gas.' That's forbidden! Anyway, I owe you my life,
U||   Conway, and I'll never forget it--never. Thanks--but the others--how
U||   about all the rest of us?"
U||   "It was Vee-Two, and it is forbidden," Costigan replied grimly, eyes
U||   fast upon the flashing plate, whose point of projection was now deep in
U||   the bowels of the vessel. "The penalty for using it or having it is
U||   death on sight. Gangsters and pirates use it, since they have nothing
U||   to lose, being on the death list already. As for your life, I haven't
U||   saved it yet--you may wish I'd let it ride before we get done. The
U||   others are too far gone for oxygen--couldn't have brought even you
U||   around a few seconds later, quick as I got to you. But there's a sure
U||   antidote--we all carry it in a lock-box in our armor--and we all know
U||   how to use it, because crooks all use Vee-Two and so we're always
U||   expecting it. But since the air will be pure again in half an hour
U||   we'll be able to revive the others easily enough if we can get by with
U||   whatever is going to happen next. There's the bird that did it, right
U||   in the air-room! It's the chief engineer's suit, but that isn't
U||   Franklin that's in it. Some passenger--disguised--slugged the
U||   chief--took his suit and projectors--hole in duct--p-s-s-t! All washed
U||   out! Maybe that's all he was scheduled to do to us in this performance,
U||   but he'll do nothing else in this life!"
U||   "Don't go down there!" protested the girl. "His armor is so much better
U||   than that emergency suit you are wearing, and he's got Mr. Franklin's
U||   Lewiston, besides!"
U||   "Don't be an idiot!" he snapped. "We can't have a live pirate
U||   aboard--we're going to be altogether too busy with outsiders directly.
U||   Don't worry, I'm not going to give him a break. I'm taking a Standish
U||   and I'll rub him out like a blot. Stay right here until I come back
U||   after you," he commanded, and the heavy, vacuum insulated door of the
U||   lifeboat clanged shut behind him as he leaped out into the promenade.
U||   Straight across the saloon he made his way, paying no attention to the
U||   inert forms scattered here and there. Going up to a blank wall, he
U||   manipulated an almost invisible dial set flush with its surface, swung
U||   a heavy door aside, and lifted out the Standish--a fearsome weapon.
U||   Squat, huge, and heavy, it resembled somewhat an overgrown machine
U||   rifle, but one possessing a thick, short telescope, with several opaque
U||   condensing lenses and parabolic reflectors. Laboring under the weight
U||   of the thing, he strode along corridors and clambered heavily down
U||   short stairways. Finally he came to the purifier room, and grinned
U||   savagely as he saw the greenish haze of light obscuring the door and
U||   walls--the shield was still in place; the pirate was still inside,
U||   still flooding with the terrible Vee-Two the Hyperion's primary air.
U||   He set his peculiar weapon down, unfolded its three massive legs,
U||   crouched down behind it and threw in a switch. Dull red beams of
U||   frightful intensity shot from the reflectors and sparks, almost of
U||   lightning proportions, leaped from the shielding screen under their
U||   impact. Roaring and snapping, the conflict went on for seconds; then,
U||   under the superior force of the Standish, the greenish radiance gave
U||   way. Behind it the metal of the door ran the gamut of color--red,
U||   yellow, blinding whiter--then literally exploded; molten, vaporized,
U||   burned away. Through the aperture thus made Costigan could plainly see
U||   the pirate in the space-armor of the chief engineer--an armor which was
U||   proof against rifle fire and which could reflect and neutralize for
U||   some little time even the terrific beam Costigan was employing. Nor was
U||   the pirate unarmed--a vicious flare of incandescence leaped from his
U||   Lewiston, to spend its force in spitting, crackling pyrotechnics
U||   against the ether-wall of the squat and monstrous Standish. But
U||   Costigan's infernal machine did not rely only upon vibratory
U||   destruction. At almost the first flash of the pirate's weapon the
U||   officer touched a trigger; there was a double report, ear-shattering in
U||   that narrowly confined space; and the pirate's body literally flew into
U||   mist as a half-kilogram shell tore through his armor and exploded.
U||   Costigan shut off his beam, and, with not the slightest softening of
U||   one hard lineament, stared around the air-room; making sure that no
U||   serious damage had been done to the vital machinery of the
U||   air-purifier--the very lungs of the great space-ship.
U||   Dismounting the Standish, he lugged it back up to the main saloon,
U||   replaced it in its safe and again set the combination lock. Thence to
U||   the lifeboat, where Clio cried out in relief as she saw that he was
U||   unhurt.
U||   "Oh, Conway, I've been so afraid something would happen to you!" she
U||   exclaimed, as he led her rapidly upward toward the control room. "Of
U||   course you...." she paused.
U||   "Sure," he replied, laconically. "Nothing to it. How do you feel--about
U||   back to normal?"
U||   "All right, I think, except for being scared to death and just about
U||   out of control. I don't suppose that I'll be good for anything, but
U||   whatever I can do, count me in on."
U||   "Fine--you may be needed, at that. Everybody's out, apparently, except
U||   those who, like me, had a warning and could hold their breath until
U||   they got to their suits."
U||   "But how did you know what it was? You can't see it, nor smell it, nor
U||   anything."
U||   "You inhaled a second before I did, and I saw your eyes. I've been in
U||   it before--and when you see a man get a jolt of that stuff just once,
U||   you never forget it. The engineers down below got it first, of
U||   course--it must have wiped them out. Then we got it in the saloon. Your
U||   passing out warned me, and luckily I had enough breath left to give the
U||   word. Quite a few of the fellows up above should have had time to get
U||   away--we'll see 'em all in the control room."
U||   "I suppose that was why you revived me--in payment for so kindly
U||   warning you of the gas attack?" The girl laughed; shaky, but game.
U||   "Something like that, probably," he answered, lightly. "Here we
U||   are--now we'll soon find out what's going to happen next."
U||   In the control room they saw at least a dozen armored figures; not now
U||   rushing about, but seated at their instruments, tense and ready.
U||   Fortunate it was that Costigan--veteran of space as he was, though
U||   young in years--had been down in the saloon; fortunate that he had been
U||   familiar with that horrible outlawed gas; fortunate that he had had the
U||   presence of mind enough and sheer physical stamina enough to send his
U||   warning without allowing one paralyzing trace to enter his own lungs.
U||   Captain Bradley, the men on watch, and several other officers in their
U||   quarters or in the wardrooms--space-hardened veterans all--had obeyed
U||   instantly and without question the amplifiers' gasped command to "get
U||   tight." Exhaling or inhaling, their air-passages had snapped as that
U||   dread "Vee-Two" was heard, and they had literally jumped into their
U||   armored suits of space--flushing them out with volume after volume of
U||   unquestionable air; holding their breath to the last possible second,
U||   until their straining lungs could endure no more.
U||   Costigan waved the girl to a vacant bench, cautiously changed into his
U||   own armor from the emergency suit he had been wearing, and approached
U||   the captain.
U||   "Anything in sight, sir?" he asked, saluting. "They should have started
U||   something before this."
U||   "They've started, but we can't locate them. We tried to send out a
U||   general sector alarm, but that had hardly started when they blanketed
U||   our wave. Look at that!"
U||   Following the captain's eyes, Costigan stared at the high powered set
U||   of the ship's operator. Upon the plate, instead of a moving, living,
U||   three-dimensional picture, there was a flashing glare of blinding white
U||   light; from the speaker, instead of intelligible speech, was issuing a
U||   roaring, crackling stream of noise.
U||   "It's impossible!" Bradley burst out, violently. "There's not a gram of
U||   metal inside the fourth zone--within a hundred thousand kilometers--and
U||   yet they must be close to send such a wave as that. But the Second
U||   thinks not--what do you think, Costigan?" The bluff commander,
U||   reactionary and of the old school as was his breed, was
U||   furious--baffled, raging inwardly to come to grips with the invisible
U||   and undetectable foe. Face to face with the inexplicable, however, he
U||   listened to the younger men with unusual tolerance.
U||   "It's not only possible; it's quite evident that they've got something
U||   we haven't." Costigan's voice was bitter. "But why shouldn't they have?
U||   Service ships never get anything until it's been experimented with for
U||   years, but pirates and such always get the new stuff as soon as it's
U||   discovered. The only good thing I can see is that we got part of a
U||   message away, and the scouts can trace that interference out there. But
U||   the pirates know that, too--it won't be long now," he concluded,
U||   grimly.
U||   He spoke truly. Before another word was spoken the outer screen flared
U||   white under a beam of terrific power, and simultaneously there appeared
U||   upon one of the lookout plates a vivid picture of the pirate vessel--a
U||   huge, black globe of steel, now emitting flaring offensive beams of
U||   force. Her invisibility lost, now that she had gone into action, she
U||   lay revealed in the middle of the first zone--at point-blank range.
U||   Instantly the powerful weapons of the Hyperion were brought to bear,
U||   and in the blast of full-driven beams the stranger's screens flamed
U||   incandescent. Heavy guns, under the recoil of whose fierce salvos, the
U||   frame of the giant globe trembled and shuddered, shot out their tons of
U||   high-explosive shell. But the pirate commander had known accurately the
U||   strength of the liner, and knew that her armament was impotent against
U||   the forces at his command. His screens were invulnerable, the giant
U||   shells were exploded harmlessly in mid-space, miles from their
U||   objective. And suddenly a frightened pencil of flame stabbed
U||   brilliantly from the black hulk of the enemy. Through the empty ether
U||   it tore, through the mighty defensive screens, through the tough metal
U||   of the outer and inner walls. Every ether-defence of the Hyperion
U||   vanished, and her acceleration dropped to a quarter of its normal
U||   value.
U||   "Right through the battery room!" Bradley groaned. "We're on the
U||   emergency drive now. Our rays are done for, and we can't seem to put a
U||   shell anywhere near her with our guns!"
U||   But ineffective as the guns were, they were silenced forever as a
U||   frightful beam of destruction stabbed relentlessly through the control
U||   room, whiffing out of existence the pilot, gunnery, and lookout panels
U||   and the men before them. The air rushed into space, and the suits of
U||   the three survivors bulged out into drumhead tightness as the pressure
U||   in the room decreased.
U||   Costigan pushed the captain lightly toward a wall, then seized the girl
U||   and leaped in the same direction.
U||   "Let's get out of here, quick!" he cried, the miniature radio
U||   instruments of the helmets automatically taking up the duty of
U||   transmitting speech as the sound disks refused to function. "They can't
U||   see us--our ether wall is still up and their spy-sprays can't get
U||   through it from the outside, you know. They're working from
U||   blue-prints, and they'll probably take your desk next," and even as
U||   they bounded toward the door, now become the outer seal of an airlock,
U||   the annihilating ray tore through the space which they had just quitted
U||   in their flight.
U||   Through the airlock, down through several levels of passengers'
U||   quarters they hurried, and into a lifeboat, whose one doorway commanded
U||   the full length of the third lounge--an ideal spot, either for defense
U||   or for escape outward by means of the miniature cruiser. As they
U||   entered their retreat they felt their weight begin to increase. More
U||   and more force was applied to the helpless liner, until it was moving
U||   at normal acceleration.
U||   "What do you make of that, Costigan?" asked the captain. "Tractor
U||   beams?"
U||   "Apparently. They've got something, all right. They're taking us
U||   somewhere, fast. I'll go get a couple of Standishes, and another suit
U||   of armor--we'd better dig in," and soon the small room became a
U||   veritable fortress, housing as it did, those two formidable engines of
U||   destruction. Then the first officer made another and longer trip,
U||   returning with a complete suit of triplanetary space armor, exactly
U||   like those worn by the two men, but considerably smaller.
U||   "Just as an added factor of safety, you'd better put this on,
U||   Clio--those emergency suits aren't good for much in a battle. I don't
U||   suppose that you ever fired a Standish, did you?"
U||   "No, but I can soon learn how to do it," she replied, pluckily.
U||   "Two is all that can work here at once, but you should know how to take
U||   hold in case one of us goes out. And while you're changing suits you'd
U||   better put on some stuff I've got here--Service special phones and
U||   detectors. Stick this little disk onto your chest with this bit of
U||   tape; low down, out of sight. Just under your wishbone is the best
U||   place. Take off your wrist-watch and wear this one continuously--never
U||   take it off for a second. Put on these pearls, and wear them all the
U||   time, too. Take this capsule and hide it against your skin, some place
U||   where it can't be found except by the most rigid search. Swallow it in
U||   an emergency--it goes down easily and works just as well inside as
U||   outside. It is the most important thing of all--you can get along with
U||   it alone if you lose everything else, but without that capsule the
U||   whole system's shot to pieces. With that outfit, if we should get
U||   separated, you can talk to us--we're both wearing 'em, although
U||   somewhat different forms. You don't need to talk loud--just a mutter
U||   will be enough. They're handy little outfits, almost impossible to
U||   find, and capable of a lot of things."
U||   "Thanks, Conway--I'll remember that, too," Clio replied, as she turned
U||   toward the tiny locker to follow his instructions. "But won't the
U||   scouts and patrols be catching us pretty quick? The operator sent a
U||   warning."
U||   "Afraid the ether's empty, as far as we're concerned. They could
U||   neutralize our detector screens, and the scouts' detectors are the same
U||   as ours."
U||   Captain Bradley had stood by in silent astonishment during this
U||   conversation. His eyes had bulged slightly at Costigan's "we're both
U||   wearing 'em," but he had held his peace and as the girl disappeared a
U||   look of dawning comprehension came over his face.
U||   "Oh, I see, sir," he said, respectfully--far more respectfully than he
U||   had ever before addressed a mere first officer. "Meaning that we both
U||   will be wearing them shortly, I assume. 'Service Specials'--but you
U||   didn't specify exactly what Service, did you?"
U||   "Now that you mention it, I don't believe that I did," Costigan
U||   grinned.
U||   "That explains several things about you--particularly your recognition
U||   of Vee-Two and your uncanny control and speed of reaction. But aren't
U||   you...."
U||   "No," Costigan interrupted, positively. "This situation is apt to get
U||   altogether too serious to overlook any bets. If we get away, I'll take
U||   them away from her and she'll never know that they aren't routine
U||   equipment in the Triplanetary Service. As for you, I know that you can
U||   and do keep your mouth shut. That's why I'm hanging this junk on you--I
U||   had a lot of stuff in my kit, but I flashed it all with the Standish,
U||   except what I brought in here for us three. Whether you think so or
U||   not, we're in a real jam--our chance of getting away is mightly close
U||   to zero. Now that I've gone this far, I might as well tell you that I
U||   don't believe these birds are pirates at all, in the ordinary sense of
U||   the word. And it may be possible that they're after me, but I don't
U||   think so--we've covered up too...."
U||   He broke off as the girl came back, now to all appearances a small
U||   Triplanetary officer, and the three settled down to a long and
U||   eventless wait. Hour after hour they flew through the ether, but
U||   finally there was a lurching swing and an abrupt increase in their
U||   acceleration. After a short consultation Captain Bradley turned on the
U||   visiray set and, with the beam at its minimum power, peered cautiously
U||   downward, in the direction opposite to that in which he knew the pirate
U||   vessel must be. All three stared into the plate, seeing only an
U||   infinity of emptiness, marked only by the infinitely remote and coldly
U||   brilliant stars. While they stared into space a vast area of the
U||   heavens was blotted out and they saw, faintly illuminated by a peculiar
U||   blue luminescence, a vast ball--a sphere so large and so close that
U||   they seemed to be dropping downward toward it as though it were a
U||   world! They came to a stop--paused, weightless--a vast door slid
U||   smoothly aside--they were drawn upward through an airlock and floated
U||   quietly in the air above a small, but brightly-lighted and orderly city
U||   of metallic buildings! Gently the Hyperion was lowered, to come to rest
U||   in the embracing arms of a regulation landing cradle.
U||   "Well, wherever it is, we're here," remarked Captain Bradley, grimly.
U||   "And now the fireworks start," assented Costigan, with a questioning
U||   glance at the girl.
U||   "Don't mind me," she answered his unspoken question. "I don't believe
U||   in surrendering, either."
U||   "Right," and both men squatted down behind the ether-walls of their
U||   terrific weapons; the girl prone behind them.
U||   They had not long to wait. A group of human beings--men and to all
U||   appearance Americans--appeared unarmed in the little lounge. As soon as
U||   they were well inside the room, Bradley and Costigan released upon them
U||   without compunction the full power of their frightful projectors. From
U||   the reflectors, through the doorway, there tore a concentrated double
U||   beam of pure destruction--but that beam did not reach its goal. Yards
U||   from the men it met a screen of impenetrable density. Instantly the
U||   gunners pressed their triggers and a stream of high-explosive shells
U||   issued from the roaring weapons. But shells, also, were futile. They
U||   struck the shield and vanished--vanished without exploding and without
U||   leaving a trace to show that they had ever existed.
U||   Costigan sprang to his feet, but before he could launch his intended
U||   attack a vast tunnel appeared beside him--an annihilating ray had swept
U||   through the entire width of the liner, cutting instantly a smooth
U||   cylinder of emptiness. Air rushed in to fill the vacuum, and the three
U||   visitors felt themselves seized by invisible forces and drawn into the
U||   tunnel. Through it they floated, up to and over the buildings, finally
U||   slanting downward toward the door of a great high-powered structure.
U||   Doors opened before them and closed behind them, until at last they
U||   stood upright in a room which was evidently the office of a busy
U||   executive. They faced a desk which, in addition to the usual equipment
U||   of the business man, carried a bewilderingly complete switchboard and
U||   instrument panel.
U||   Seated impassively at the desk there was a gray man. Not only was he
U||   dressed entirely in gray, but his heavy hair was gray, his eyes were
U||   gray, and even his tanned skin seemed to give the impression of
U||   grayness in disguise. His overwhelming personality radiated an aura of
U||   grayness--not the gentle gray of the dove, but the resistless, driving
U||   gray of the super-dreadnaught; the hard, inflexible, brittle gray of
U||   the fracture of high-carbon steel.
U||   "Captain Bradley, First Officer Costigan, Miss Marsden," the man spoke
U||   quietly, but crisply. "I had not intended you two men to live so long.
U||   That is a detail, however, which we will pass by for the moment. You
U||   may remove your suits."
U||   Neither officer moved, but both stared back at the speaker
U||   unflinchingly.
U||   "I am not accustomed to repeating instructions," the man at the desk
U||   continued; voice still low and level, but instinct with deadly menace.
U||   "You may choose between removing those suits and dying in them, here
U||   and now."
U||   Costigan moved over to Clio and slowly took off her armor. Then, after
U||   a flashing exchange of glances and a muttered word, the two officers
U||   threw off their suits simultaneously and fired at the same instant;
U||   Bradley with his Lewiston, Costigan with a heavy automatic pistol whose
U||   bullets were explosive shells of tremendous power. But the man in gray,
U||   surrounded by an impenetrable wall of force, only smiled at the
U||   fusillade, tolerantly and maddeningly. Costigan leaped fiercely, only
U||   to be hurled backward as he struck that unyielding, invisible wall. A
U||   vicious beam snapped him back into place, the weapons were snatched
U||   away, and all three captives were held in their former positions.
U||   "I permitted that, as a demonstration of futility," the gray man said,
U||   his hard voice becoming harder, "but I will permit no more foolishness.
U||   Now I will introduce myself. I am known as Roger. You probably have
U||   heard nothing of me yet but you will--if you live. Whether or not you
U||   two live depends solely upon yourselves. Being something of a student
U||   of men, I fear that you will both die shortly. Able and resourceful as
U||   you have just shown yourselves to be, you could be valuable to me, but
U||   you probably will not--in which case you shall, of course, cease to
U||   exist. That, however, in its proper time--you shall be of some slight
U||   service to me in the process of being eliminated. In your case, Miss
U||   Marsden, I find myself undecided between two courses of action; each
U||   highly desirable, but unfortunately mutually exclusive. Your father
U||   will be glad to ransom you at an exceedingly high figure, but, in spite
U||   of that fact, I may decide to keep you for--well, let us say for
U||   certain purposes."
U||   "Yes?" Clio rose magnificently to the occasion. Fear forgotten, her
U||   courageous spirit flashed from her clear, young eyes and emanated from
U||   her slender, rounded young body, erect in defiance. "Since I am a
U||   captive, you can of course do anything you please with me up to a
U||   certain point--but no further, believe me!"
U||   With no sign of having heard her outburst Roger pressed a button and a
U||   tall, comely woman, appeared--a woman of indefinite age and of
U||   uncertain nationality.
U||   "Show Miss Marsden to her apartment," he directed, and as the two women
U||   went out a man came in.
U||   "The cargo is unloaded, sir," the newcomer reported. "The two men and
U||   the five women indicated have been taken to the hospital," was the
U||   report of the man.
U||   "Very well, dispose of the others in the usual fashion." The minion
U||   went out, and Roger continued, emotionlessly:
U||   "Collectively, the other passengers may be worth a million or so, but
U||   it would not be worth while to waste time upon them."
U||   "What are you, anyway?" blazed Costigan, helpless but enraged beyond
U||   caution. "I have heard of mad scientists who tried to destroy the
U||   earth, and of equally mad geniuses who thought themselves Napoleons
U||   capable of conquering even the Solar System. Whichever you are, you
U||   should know that you can't get away with it."
U||   "I am neither. I am, however, a scientist, and I direct many other
U||   scientists. I am not mad. You have undoubtedly noticed several peculiar
U||   features of this place?"
U||   "Yes, particularly the artificial gravity, which has always been
U||   considered impossible, and those screens. An ordinary ether-wall is
U||   opaque in one direction, and doesn't bar matter--yours are transparent
U||   both ways and something more than impenetrable to matter. How do you do
U||   it?"
U||   "You could not understand them if I explained them to you, and they are
U||   merely two of our smaller developments. I have no serious designs upon
U||   the earth nor upon the Solar System, nor have I any desire to rule
U||   over, or to control the destinies of masses of futile and brainless
U||   men. I have, however, certain ends of my own in view. To accomplish my
U||   plans I require hundreds of millions in gold, other hundreds of
U||   millions in platinum and noble metal, and some five kilograms of the
U||   bromide of radium--all of which I shall take from the planets of this
U||   Solar System before I leave it. I shall take them in spite of the
U||   puerile efforts of the fleets of your Triplanetary League.
U||   "This structure, floating in a planetary orbit, was designed by me and
U||   built under my direction. It is protected from meteorites by certain
U||   forces of my devising. It is undetectable and invisible--your detectors
U||   do not touch it and light-waves are bent around it without loss or
U||   distortion. I am discussing these points at such length so that you may
U||   realize exactly your position. As I have intimated, you can be of
U||   assistance to me if you will."
U||   "Now just what could you offer any man to make him join your outfit?"
U||   demanded Costigan, venomously.
U||   "Many things." Roger's cold tone betrayed no emotion, no recognition of
U||   Costigan's open and bitter contempt. "I have under me many men, bound
U||   to me by many ties. Needs, wants, longings and desires differ from man
U||   to man, and I can satisfy practically any of them. Personally, I take
U||   delight in the society of young and beautiful women, and many men have
U||   that same taste; but there are other urges which I have found quite
U||   efficient. Greed, thirst for fame, longing for power, and so on,
U||   including many qualities usually regarded as 'noble.' And what I
U||   promise, I deliver. I demand only loyalty to me, and that only in
U||   certain things and for a relatively short period. In all else, my men
U||   do as they please. In conclusion, I can use you two conveniently, but I
U||   do not need you. Therefore you may choose now between my service
U||   and--the alternative."
U||   "Exactly what is the alternative?"
U||   "We will not go into that. Suffice it to say that it has to do with a
U||   minor research, which is not progressing satisfactorily. It will result
U||   in your extinction, and perhaps I should mention that that extinction
U||   will not be particularly pleasant."
U||   "I say NO, you...." Bradley roared. He intended to give an unexpurgated
U||   classification, but was rudely interrupted.
U||   "Hold on a minute!" snapped Costigan. "How about Miss Marsden?"
U||   "She has nothing to do with this discussion," returned Roger, icily. "I
U||   do not bargain--in fact, I believe that I shall keep her for a time.
U||   She has it in mind to destroy herself, if I do not allow her to be
U||   ransomed, but she will find that door closed to her until I permit it
U||   to open."
U||   "In that case, I string along with the Chief--take what he started to
U||   say about you and run it clear across the board for me!" barked
U||   Costigan.
U||   "Very well. That decision was to be expected from men of your type."
U||   The gray man touched two buttons and two of his creatures entered the
U||   room. "Put these men into separate cells on the second level," he
U||   ordered. "Search them to the skin: all their weapons may not have been
U||   in their armor. Seal the doors and mount special guards, tuned to me
U||   here."
U||   Imprisoned they were, and carefully searched; but they bore no arms,
U||   and nothing had been said or thought of communicators. Even if such
U||   instruments could be concealed, Roger would detect their use instantly.
U||   At least, so would have run his thought had the subject entered his
U||   mind. But even Roger had no inkling of the possibility of Costigan's
U||   "Service Special" phones, detectors and spy-ray--instruments of minute
U||   size and of infinitesimal power, but yet instruments which, working as
U||   they were, below the level of the ether, were effective at great
U||   distances and caused no vibrations in the ether by which their use
U||   could be detected. And what could be more innocent than the regulation,
U||   personal equipment of every officer of space? The heavy goggles, the
U||   wrist-watch and its supplementary pocket chronometer, the flash-lamp,
U||   the automatic lighter, the sender, the money-belt?
U||   All these items of equipment were examined with due care; but the
U||   cleverest minds of Triplanetary's Secret Service had designated those
U||   communicators to pass any ordinary search, however careful, and when
U||   Costigan and Bradley were finally locked into the designated cells,
U||   they still possessed their ultra-instruments.
U||CHAPTER II
U||  In Roger's Planetoid
U||   In the hall Clio glanced around her wildly, her bosom heaving, eyes
U||   darting here and there, seeking even the narrowest avenue of escape.
U||   Before she could act, however, her body was clamped inflexibly, as
U||   though in a vise, and she struggled, motionless.
U||   "It is useless to attempt to escape, or to do anything except what
U||   Roger wishes," the guide informed her somberly, snapping off the
U||   instrument in her hand and thus restoring to the thoroughly cowed girl
U||   her freedom of motion.
U||   "His lightest wish is law," she continued as they walked down a long
U||   corridor. "The sooner you realize that you must do exactly as he
U||   pleases, in all things, the easier your life will be."
U||   "But I wouldn't want to keep on living!" Clio declared, with a flash of
U||   spirit. "And I can always die, you know."
U||   "You will find that you cannot," the passionless creature returned,
U||   monotonously. "If you do not yield, you will long and pray for death,
U||   but you will not die unless Roger wills it. I was like you once. I also
U||   struggled, and I became what I am now--whatever it is. Here is your
U||   apartment. You will stay here until Roger gives further orders
U||   concerning you."
U||   The living automaton opened a door and stood silent and impassive,
U||   while Clio, staring at her in unutterable horror, shrank past her and
U||   into the sumptuously furnished suite. The door closed soundlessly and
U||   utter silence descended as a pall. Not an ordinary silence, but the
U||   indescribable perfection of the absolute, complete absence of all
U||   sound. In that silence Clio stood motionless. Tense and rigid,
U||   hopeless, despairing, she stood there in that magnificent room,
U||   fighting an almost overwhelming impulse to scream. Suddenly she heard
U||   the cold voice of Roger, speaking from the empty air.
U||   "You are over-wrought, Miss Marsden. You can be of no use to yourself
U||   or to me in that condition. I command you to rest; and, to insure that
U||   rest, you may pull that cord, which will establish about this room an
U||   ether wall: a wall cutting off even this my voice...."
U||   The voice ceased as she pulled the cord savagely and threw herself upon
U||   a divan in a torrent of gasping, strangling, but rebellious sobs. Then
U||   again came a voice, but not to her ears. Deep within her, pervading
U||   every bone and muscle, it made itself felt rather than heard.
U||   "Clio?" it asked. "Don't talk yet...."
U||   "Conway!" she gasped in relief, every fiber of her being thrilled into
U||   new hope at the deep, well-remembered voice of Conway Costigan.
U||   "Keep still!" he snapped. "Don't act so happy! He may have a spy-ray on
U||   you. He can't hear me, but he may be able to hear you. When he was
U||   talking to you you must have noticed a sort of rough, sandpapery
U||   feeling under that necklace I gave you? Since he's got an ether-wall
U||   around you the beads are dead now. If you feel anything like that under
U||   the wrist-watch, breathe deeply, twice. If you don't feel anything
U||   there, it's safe for you to talk, as loud as you please.
U||   "I don't feel a thing, Conway!" she rejoiced. Tears forgotten, she was
U||   her old, buoyant self again. "So that wall is real, after all? I only
U||   about half believed it."
U||   "Don't trust it too much, because he can cut it off from the outside
U||   any time he wants to. Remember what I told you: that necklace will warn
U||   you of any spy-ray in the ether, and the watch will detect anything
U||   below the level of the ether. It's dead now, of course, since our three
U||   phones are direct-connected; I'm in touch with Bradley, too. Don't be
U||   too scared; we've got a lot better chance that I thought we had."
U||   "What? You don't mean it!"
U||   "Absolutely. I'm beginning to think that maybe we've got something he
U||   doesn't know exists--our ultra-wave. Of course I wasn't surprised when
U||   his searchers failed to find our instruments, but it never occurred to
U||   me that I might have a clear field to use them in! I can't quite
U||   believe it yet, but I haven't been able to find any indication that he
U||   can even detect the bands we are using. I'm going to look around over
U||   there with my spy-ray ... I'm looking at you now--feel it?"
U||   "Yes, the watch feels that way, now."
U||   "Fine! Not a sign of interference over here, either. I can't find a
U||   trace of ultra-wave--anything below ether-level, you know--anywhere in
U||   the whole place. He's got so much stuff that we've never heard of that
U||   I supposed of course he'd have ultra-wave, too; but if he hasn't, that
U||   gives us the edge. Well, Bradley and I've got a lot of work to do....
U||   Wait a minute, I just had a thought. I'll be back in about a second."
U||   There was a brief pause, then the soundless, but clear voice went on:
U||   "Good hunting! That woman that gave you the blue willies isn't
U||   alive--she's full of the prettiest machinery and communicators you ever
U||   saw!"
U||   "Oh, Conway!" and the girl's voice broke in an engulfing wave of
U||   thanksgiving and relief. "It was so unutterably horrible, thinking of
U||   what must have happened to her and to others like her!"
U||   "He's running a colossal bluff, I think. He's good, all right, but he
U||   lacks quite a lot of being omnipotent. But don't get too cocky, either.
U||   Plenty has happened to plenty of women here, and men too--and plenty
U||   may happen to us unless we put out a few jets. Keep a stiff upper lip,
U||   and if you want us, yell. 'Bye!"
U||   The silent voice ceased, the watch upon Clio's wrist again became an
U||   unobtrusive timepiece, and Costigan, in his solitary cell far below her
U||   tower room, turned his peculiarly goggled eyes toward other scenes. In
U||   his pockets his hands manipulated tiny controls, and through the lenses
U||   of those goggles Costigan's keen and highly-trained eyes studied every
U||   concealed detail of mechanism of the great globe, the while he planned
U||   what must be done. Finally, he took off the goggles and spoke in a low
U||   voice to Bradley, confined in another windowless room across the hall.
U||   "I think I've got dope enough, Captain. I've found out where he put our
U||   armor and guns, and I've located all the main leads, controls, and
U||   generators. There are no ether-walls around us here, but every door is
U||   shielded, and there are guards outside our doors--one to each of us.
U||   They're robots, not men. That makes it harder, since they're
U||   undoubtedly connected direct to Roger's desk, and will give an alarm at
U||   the first hint of abnormal performance. We can't do a thing until he
U||   leaves his desk. See that black panel, a little below the cord-switch
U||   to the right of your door? That's the conduit cover. When I give you
U||   the word, tear that off and you'll see one red wire in the cable. It
U||   feeds the shield-generator of your door. Break that wire and join me
U||   out in the hall. Sorry I had only one of these ultra-wave spies, but
U||   once we're together it won't be so bad. Here's what I thought we could
U||   do," and he went over in detail the only course of action which his
U||   surveys had shown to be possible.
U||   "There, he's left his desk!" Costigan exclaimed after the conversation
U||   had continued for almost an hour. "Now as soon as we find out where
U||   he's going, we'll start something ... he's going to see Clio, the
U||   swine! This changes things, Bradley!" His hard voice was a curse.
U||   "Somewhat!" blazed the captain. "I know how you two have been getting
U||   on all during the cruise. I'm with you, but what can we do?"
U||   "We'll do something," Costigan declared grimly. "If he makes a pass at
U||   her I'll get him if I have to blow this whole sphere out of space, with
U||   us in it!"
U||   "Don't do that, Conway." Clio's low voice, trembling but determined,
U||   was felt by both men and both gasped audibly: they had forgotten that
U||   there were three instruments in the circuit. "If there's a chance for
U||   you to get away and do anything about fighting him, don't mind me.
U||   Maybe he only wants to talk about the ransom, anyway."
U||   "He wouldn't talk ransom to you--he's going to talk something else
U||   entirely," Costigan gritted; then his voice changed suddenly. "But say,
U||   maybe it's just as well this way. They didn't find our specials when
U||   they searched us, you know, and we're going to do plenty of damage
U||   right soon now. Roger probably isn't a fast worker--more the
U||   cat-and-mouse type, I'd say--and after we get started he'll have
U||   something on his mind besides you. Think you can stall him off and keep
U||   him interested for about fifteen minutes?"
U||   "I'm sure I can--I'll do anything to help us, or you, get away from
U||   this horrible...." Her voice ceased as Roger broke the ether-wall of
U||   her apartment and walked toward the divan upon which she crouched in
U||   wide-eyed, helpless, trembling terror.
U||   "Get ready, Bradley!" Costigan directed tersely. "He's left Clio's
U||   ether-wall off, so that any abnormal signals would be relayed to him
U||   from his desk--he knows that there's no chance of anyone disturbing him
U||   in that room. But I'm holding my beam on that switch--it's as good a
U||   conductor as metal--so that the wall is on, full strength. No matter
U||   what we do now, he can't get a warning. I'll have to hold the beam
U||   exactly on the switch, though, so you'll have to do the dirty work.
U||   Tear out that red wire and kill those two guards. You know how to kill
U||   a robot, don't you?"
U||   "Yes--break his eye-lenses and his eardrums and he'll stop whatever
U||   he's doing and send out distress calls.... Got 'em both. Now what?"
U||   "Open my door--the shield switch is to the right."
U||   Costigan's door flew open and the Triplanetary captain leaped into the
U||   room.
U||   "Now for our armor!" he cried.
U||   "Not yet!" snapped Costigan. He was standing rigid, goggled eyes
U||   staring immovably at a spot upon the ceiling. "I can't move a
U||   millimeter until you've closed Clio's ether-wall switch. If I take this
U||   ray off it for a second we're sunk. Five floors up, straight ahead down
U||   a corridor--fourth door on right. When you're at the switch you'll feel
U||   my ray on your watch. Snap it up!"
U||   "Right!" and the captain leaped away at a pace to be equaled by few men
U||   of half his years.
U||   Soon he was back, and after Costigan had tested the ether-wall of the
U||   "bridal suite" to make sure that no warning signal from his desk or his
U||   servants could reach Roger within it, the two officers hurried away
U||   toward the room in which their discarded space-armor had been stored.
U||   "Too bad they don't wear uniforms," panted Bradley, short of breath
U||   from the many flights of stairs. "Might have helped some as disguise."
U||   "I doubt it--with so many robots around, they've probably got signals
U||   that we couldn't understand, anyway. If we meet anybody it'll mean a
U||   battle. Hold it!" Peering through walls with his spy-ray, Costigan had
U||   seen two men approaching, blocking an intersecting corridor into which
U||   they must turn. "Two of 'em, a man and a robot--the robot's on your
U||   side. We'll wait here, right at the corner--when they round it, take
U||   'em!" And Costigan put away his goggles in readiness for strife.
U||   All unsuspecting, the two pirates came into view, and as they appeared
U||   the two officers struck. Costigan, on the inside, drove a short, hard
U||   right low into the human pirate's abdomen. The fiercely driven fist
U||   sank to the wrist into the soft tissues and the stricken man collapsed.
U||   But even as the blow landed, Costigan had seen that there was a third
U||   enemy, following close behind the two he had been watching, a pirate
U||   who was even then training a ray projector upon him. Reacting
U||   automatically, Costigan swung his unconscious opponent around in front
U||   of him, so that it was into that insensible body that the vicious ray
U||   tore, and not into his own. Crouching down into the smallest possible
U||   compass, he straightened his powerful body with the lashing force of a
U||   mighty steel spring, hurling the corpse straight at the flaming mouth
U||   of the projector. The weapon crashed to the floor and dead pirate and
U||   living went down in a heap. Upon that heap Costigan hurled himself,
U||   feeling for the enemy's throat. But the pirate had wriggled clear, and
U||   countered with a gouging thrust that would have torn out the eyes of a
U||   slower man, following it up instantly with a savage kick for the groin.
U||   No automaton this, geared and set to perform certain fixed duties with
U||   mechanical precision, but a lithe, strong man in hard training,
U||   fighting with every foul trick known to his murderous ilk.
U||   But Costigan was no tyro in the art of dirty fighting. Few indeed are
U||   the maiming tricks of foul combat unknown to even the rank and file of
U||   the highly efficient Secret Service of the Triplanetary League; and
U||   Costigan, a Sector Chief of that unknown organization, knew them all.
U||   Not for pleasure, sportsmanship, nor million-dollar purses do those
U||   secret agents use Nature's weapons. They come to grips only when it
U||   cannot possibly be avoided, but when they are forced to fight in that
U||   fashion they go into it with but one grim purpose--to kill, and to kill
U||   in the shortest possible space of time. Thus it was that Costigan's
U||   opening soon came. The pirate launched a particularly vicious kick, the
U||   dreaded "coup de sabot," which Costigan avoided by a lightning shift.
U||   It was a slight shift, barely enough to make the kicker miss, and two
U||   powerful hands closed upon that flying foot in midair like the sprung
U||   jaws of a bear-trap. Closed and twisted viciously, in the same fleeting
U||   instant. There was a shriek, smothered as a heavy boot crashed to its
U||   carefully pre-determined mark: the pirate was out, definitely and
U||   permanently.
U||   The struggle had lasted scarcely ten seconds, coming to its close just
U||   as Bradley finished blinding and deafening the robot. Costigan picked
U||   up the projector, again donned his spy-ray goggles, and the two hurried
U||   on.
U||   "Nice work, Chief--it must be a gift to rough-house the way you do,"
U||   Bradley exclaimed. "That's why you took the live one?"
U||   "Practice helps some, too! I've been in brawls before, and I'm a lot
U||   younger and maybe some faster than you are," Costigan explained
U||   briefly, penetrant gaze rigidly to the fore as they ran along one
U||   corridor after another.
U||   Several more guards, both living and mechanical, were encountered on
U||   the way, but they were not permitted to offer any opposition. Costigan
U||   saw them first. In the furious beam of the projector of the dead pirate
U||   they were riven into nothingness, and the two officers sped on to the
U||   room which Costigan had located from afar. The three suits of
U||   Triplanetary space armor had been sealed into a cabinet whose doors
U||   Costigan literally blew off with a blast of force, rather than consume
U||   time in tracing the power leads.
U||   "I feel like something now!" Costigan, once more encased in his own
U||   armor, heaved a great sigh of relief. "Rough-and-tumble's all right
U||   with one or two, but that generator room is full of grief, and we won't
U||   have any too much stuff as it is. We've got to take Clio's suit
U||   along--we'll carry it down to the door of the power room, drop it
U||   there, and pick it up after we've wrecked the works."
U||   Contemptuous now of possible guards, the armored pair strode toward the
U||   room which housed the pulsating heart of the immense fortress of space.
U||   Guards were encountered, and captains--officers who signaled
U||   frantically to their chief, since he alone could unleash the frightful
U||   forces at his command, and who profanely wondered at his unwonted
U||   silence--but the enemy beams were impotent against the mighty
U||   ether-walls of that armor; and the pirates, without armor in the
U||   security of their own planet as they were, vanished utterly in the
U||   ravening beams of the twin Lewistons. As they paused before the door of
U||   the power room, both men felt Clio's voice raised in her first and last
U||   appeal, an appeal wrung from her against her will by the extremity of
U||   her position.
U||   "Conway! Hurry! Oh, hurry! I can't last much longer--good-bye, dear!"
U||   In the horror-filled tones both men read clearly the girl's dire
U||   extremity. Each saw plainly a happy, care-free young earth girl, upon
U||   her first trip into space, locked inside an ether-wall with an
U||   over-brained, under-conscienced human machine--a super-intelligent but
U||   lecherous and unmoral mechanism of flesh and blood, acknowledging no
U||   authority, ruled by nothing save his own scientific drivings and the
U||   almost equally powerful urges of his desires and passions! She had
U||   fought with every resource at her command. She had wept and pleaded,
U||   she had stormed and raged, she had feigned submission and had played
U||   for time--and her torment had not touched in the slightest degree the
U||   merciless and gloating brain of the being who called himself Roger. Now
U||   his tantalizing, ruthless cat-play was done, the horrible gray-brown
U||   face was close to hers--she wailed her final despairing message to
U||   Costigan and attacked that hideous face with the fury of a tigress.
U||   Costigan bit off a bitter imprecation. "Hold him just a second longer,
U||   sweetheart!" he cried, and the power room door vanished.
U||   Through the great room the two Lewistons swept at full aperture and at
U||   maximum power, two rapidly opening fans of death and destruction. Here
U||   and there a guard, more rapid than his fellows, trained a futile
U||   projector--a projector whose magazine exploded at the touch of that
U||   frightful field of force, liberating instantaneously its thousands upon
U||   thousands of kilowatt-hours of stored-up energy. Through the delicately
U||   adjusted, complex mechanisms the destroying beams tore. At their touch
U||   armatures burned out, high-tension leads volatilized in crashing,
U||   high-voltage sparks, masses of metal smoked and burned in the path of
U||   vast forces now seeking the easiest path to neutralization, delicate
U||   instruments blew up, copper ran in streams like water. As the last
U||   machine subsided into a semi-molten mass of metal the two wreckers,
U||   each grasping a brace, felt themselves become weightless and knew that
U||   they had accomplished the first part of their program.
U||   Costigan leaped for the outer door. His the task to go to Clio's
U||   aid.... Bradley would follow more slowly, bringing the girl's armor and
U||   taking care of any possible pursuit. As he sailed through the air he
U||   spoke.
U||   "Coming, Clio! All right, girl?" Questioningly, half fearfully.
U||   "All right, Conway." Her voice was almost unrecognizable, broken in
U||   retching agony. "When everything went crazy he ... found out that the
U||   ether-wall was up ... forgot all about me. He shut it off ... and
U||   seemed to go crazy, too ... he is floundering around like a wild man
U||   now.... I'm trying to keep ... him from ... going down-stairs."
U||   "Good girl--keep him busy one minute more--he's getting all the
U||   warnings at once and wants to get back to his board. But what's the
U||   matter with you? Did he ... hurt you, after all?"
U||   "Oh, no; not that. But I'm sick--horribly sick. I'm falling.... I'm so
U||   dizzy I can scarcely see ... my head is breaking up into little pieces
U||   ... I just know I'm going to die, Conway! Oh ... oh!"
U||   "Oh, is that all!" In his sheer relief that they had been in time,
U||   Costigan did not think of sympathizing with Clio's very real present
U||   distress of mind and body. "I forgot that you're a
U||   ground-gripper--that's just a little touch of space-sickness. It'll
U||   wear off directly.... All right, I'm coming! Let go of him and get as
U||   far away from him as you can!"
U||   He was now in the street. Perhaps two hundred feet distant and a
U||   hundred feet above him was the tower room in which were Clio and Roger.
U||   He sprang directly toward its large window, and as he floated "upward"
U||   he corrected his course and accelerated his pace by firing backward at
U||   various angles with his heavy service pistol, uncaring that at the
U||   point of impact of each of those shells a small blast of destruction
U||   erupted. He missed the window a trifle, but that did not matter--his
U||   flaming Lewiston opened a way for him, partly through the window,
U||   partly through the wall. As he soared through the opening he trained
U||   projector and pistol upon Roger, now almost to the door, noticing as he
U||   did so that Clio was clinging convulsively to a lamp-bracket upon the
U||   wall. Door and wall vanished in the Lewiston's terrific beam, but the
U||   pirate stood unharmed. Neither ravening ray nor explosive shell could
U||   harm him--he had snapped on the protective shield whose generator was
U||   always upon his person.
U||   But Roger, while not exactly a ground-gripper, did not know how to
U||   handle himself without weight; whereas Costigan, given six walls
U||   against which to push, was even more efficient in weightless combat
U||   than when handicapped by the force of gravitation. Keeping his
U||   projector upon the pirate, he seized the first club to hand--a long,
U||   slender pedestal of metal--and launched himself past the pirate chief.
U||   With all the momentum of his mass and velocity and all the power of his
U||   mighty right arm he swung the bar at the pirate's head. That fiercely
U||   driven mass of metal should have taken Roger's head from his shoulders,
U||   but it did not. That shield of force was utterly rigid and
U||   impenetrable; the only effect of the frightful blow was to set him
U||   spinning, end over end, like the flying baton of an acrobatic
U||   drum-major. As the spinning form crashed against the opposite wall of
U||   the room, Bradley floated in, carrying Clio's armor. Without a word the
U||   captain loosened the helpless girl's grip upon the bracket and encased
U||   her in the suit. Then, supporting her at the window, he held his
U||   Lewiston upon the captive's head while Costigan propelled him toward
U||   the opening. Both men knew that Roger's shield of force must be
U||   threatened every instant--that if he were allowed to release it he
U||   probably would bring to bear a hand-weapon even superior to their own.
U||   Braced against the wall, Costigan sighted along Roger's body toward the
U||   most distant point of the lofty dome of the artificial planet and gave
U||   him a gentle push. Then, each grasping Clio by an arm, the two officers
U||   shoved mightily with their feet and the three armored forms darted away
U||   toward their only hope of escape--an emergency boat which could be
U||   launched through the shell of the great globe. To attempt to reach the
U||   Hyperion and to escape in one of her lifeboats would have been useless;
U||   they could not have forced the great gates of the main air-locks and no
U||   other exits existed. As they sailed onward through the air, Costigan
U||   keeping the slowly-floating form of Roger enveloped in his beam, Clio
U||   began to recover.
U||   "Suppose they get their gravity fixed?" she asked, apprehensively. "And
U||   they're raying us and shooting at us!"
U||   "They may have fixed it already. They undoubtedly have spare parts and
U||   duplicate generators, but if they turn it on the fall will kill Roger
U||   too, and he wouldn't like that. They'll have to get him down with an
U||   airship, and they know that we'll get them as fast as they come up.
U||   They can't hurt us with hand-weapons, and before they can bring up any
U||   heavy stuff they'll be afraid to use it, because we'll be too close to
U||   their shell.
U||   "I wish we could have brought Roger along," he continued, savagely, to
U||   Bradley. "But you were right, of course--it'd be altogether too much
U||   like a rabbit capturing a wildcat. My Lewiston's about done right now,
U||   and there can't be much left of yours--what he'd do to us would be a
U||   sin and a shame."
U||   Now at the great wall, the two men heaved mightily upon a lever, the
U||   gate of the emergency port swung slowly open, and they entered the
U||   miniature cruiser of the void. Costigan, familiar with the mechanism of
U||   the craft from careful study from his prison cell, manipulated the
U||   controls. Through gate after massive gate they went, until finally they
U||   were out in open space, shooting toward distant Tellus at the maximum
U||   acceleration of which their small craft was capable.
U||   Costigan cut the other two phones out of circuit and spoke, his
U||   attention fixed upon some extremely distant point.
U||   "Samms!" he called, sharply. "Costigan. We're out ... all right ... yes
U||   ... sure ... absolutely ... you tell 'em, Sammy; I've got company
U||   here."
U||   Through the sound-disks of their helmets the girl and the captain had
U||   heard Costigan's share of the conversation. Bradley stared at his
U||   erstwhile first officer in amazement, and even Clio had often heard
U||   that mighty, half-mythical name. Surely that bewildering young man must
U||   rank high, to speak so familiarly to Virgil Samms, the all-powerful
U||   head of the space-pervading Secret Service of the Triplanetary League!
U||   "You've turned in a general call-out," Bradley stated, rather than
U||   asked.
U||   "Long ago--I've been in touch right along," Costigan answered. "Now
U||   that they know what to look for and know that ether-wave detectors are
U||   useless, they can find it. Every vessel in seven sectors, clear down to
U||   the scout patrols, is concentrating on this point, and the call is out
U||   for all battleships and cruisers afloat. There are enough operatives
U||   out there with ultra-waves to locate that globe, and once they spot it
U||   they'll point it out to all the other vessels."
U||   "But how about the other prisoners?" asked the girl. "They'll all be
U||   killed, won't they?"
U||   "Hard telling," Costigan shrugged. "Depends on how things turn out. We
U||   lack a lot of being safe ourselves yet, and it's my personal opinion
U||   that there's going to be a real war."
U||   "What's worrying me mostly is our own chance," Bradley assented. "They
U||   will chase us, of course."
U||   "Sure, and they'll have more speed than we have. Depends on how far
U||   away the nearest Triplanetary vessels are. Anyway, we've done
U||   everything we can do--it's in the laps of the gods now."
U||   Silence fell, and Costigan cut in Clio's phone and came over to the
U||   seat upon which she was reclining, white and stricken--worn out by the
U||   horrible and terrifying ordeals of the last few hours. As he seated
U||   himself beside her she blushed vividly, but her deep blue eyes met his
U||   gray ones steadily.
U||   "Clio, I ... we ... you ... that is," he flushed hotly and stopped.
U||   This secret agent, whose clear, keen brain no physical danger could
U||   cloud; who had proved over and over again that he was never at a loss
U||   in any emergency, however desperate--this quick-witted officer
U||   floundered in embarrassment like any schoolboy, but continued,
U||   doggedly: "I'm afraid that I gave myself away back there, but...."
U||   "We gave ourselves away, you mean," she filled in the pause. "I did my
U||   share, but I won't hold you to it if you don't want--but I know that
U||   you love me, Conway!"
U||   "Love you!" The man groaned, his face lined and hard, his whole body
U||   rigid. "That doesn't half tell it, Clio. You don't need to hold me--I'm
U||   held for life. There never was a woman who meant anything to me before,
U||   and there never will be another. You're the only woman that ever
U||   existed. It isn't that. Can't you see that it's impossible?"
U||   "Of course I can't--it isn't impossible, at all." She released her
U||   finger shields, four hands met and tightly clasped; and her low voice
U||   thrilled with feeling as she went on: "You love me and I love you. That
U||   is all that matters."
U||   "I wish it were," Costigan returned bitterly, "but you don't know what
U||   you'd be letting yourself in for. It's who and what you are and who and
U||   what I am that's eating me. You, Clio Marsden, Curtis Marsden's
U||   daughter. Nineteen years old. You think you've been places and done
U||   things. You haven't. You haven't seen or done anything--you don't know
U||   what it's all about. And who am I to love a girl like you? A homeless
U||   space-flea who hasn't been on any planet three weeks in three years. A
U||   hard-boiled egg. A trouble-shooter and a brawler by instinct and
U||   training. A sp...." He bit off the word and went on quickly: "Why, you
U||   don't know me at all, and there's a lot of me that you never will
U||   know--that I can't let you know! You'd better lay off me, girl, while
U||   you can. It'll be best for you, believe me."
U||   "But I can't Conway, and neither can you," the girl answered softly, a
U||   glorious light in her eyes. "It's too late for that. On the ship it was
U||   just another of those things, but since then we've come really to know
U||   each other, and we're sunk. The situation is out of control, and we
U||   both know it--and neither of us would change it if we could, and you
U||   know that, too. I don't know very much, I admit, but I do know what you
U||   thought you'd have to keep from me, and I admire you all the more for
U||   it. We all honor the Service, Conway dearest--it is only you men who
U||   have made and are keeping the Three Planets fit places to live in--and
U||   I know that Virgil Samms' chief lieutenant would have to be a man in
U||   four thousand million...."
U||   "What makes you think that?" he demanded sharply.
U||   "You told me so yourself, indirectly. Who else in the known Universe
U||   could possibly call him 'Sammy'? You are hard, of course, but you must
U||   be so--and I never did like soft men, anyway. And you brawl in a good
U||   cause. You are very much a man, my Conway; a real, real man, and I love
U||   you! Now, if they catch us, all right--we'll die together, at least!"
U||   she finished, passionately.
U||   "You're right, sweetheart, of course," he admitted. "I don't believe
U||   that I could really let you let me go, even though I know you ought
U||   to," and their hands locked together even more firmly than before. "If
U||   we ever get out of this jam I'm going to kiss you, but this is no time
U||   to be taking off your helmet. In fact, I'm taking too many chances with
U||   you in keeping your finger shields off. Snap 'em on, Clio mine; the
U||   pirates ought to be getting fairly close by this time."
U||   Hands released and armor again tight, Costigan went over to join
U||   Bradley at the control board.
U||   "How're they coming, Captain?" he asked.
U||   "Not so good. Quite a ways off yet. At least an hour, I'd say, before a
U||   cruiser can get within range."
U||   "I'll see if I can locate any of the pirates chasing up. If I do, it'll
U||   be by accident; this little spy-ray isn't good for much except close
U||   work. I'm afraid the first warning we'll have will be when they take
U||   hold of us with a beam or spear us with a ray. Probably a beam, though;
U||   this is one of their emergency lifeboats and they wouldn't want to
U||   destroy it unless they have to. Also, I imagine that Roger wants us
U||   alive pretty badly. He has unfinished business with all three of us,
U||   and I can well believe that his 'not particularly pleasant extinction'
U||   will be even less so after the way we rooked him."
U||   "I want you to do me a favor, Conway." Clio's face was white with
U||   horror at the thought of facing again that unspeakable creature of
U||   gray. "Give me a gun or something, please. I don't want him to touch me
U||   again while I'm alive."
U||   "He won't," Costigan assured her, narrow of eye and grim of jaw. He
U||   was, as she had said, hard. "But you don't want a gun. You might get
U||   nervous and use it too soon. I'll take care of you at the last possible
U||   moment, because if he gets hold of us we won't stand a chance of
U||   getting away again."
U||   For minutes there was silence, Costigan surveying the ether in all
U||   directions with his ultra-wave device. Suddenly he laughed, deeply and
U||   with real enjoyment, and the others stared at him in surprise.
U||   "No, I'm not crazy," he told them. "This is really funny; it had never
U||   occurred to me that all these pirate ships are invisible to any ether
U||   wave as long as they're using power. I can see them, of course, with
U||   this sub-ether spy, but they can't see us! I knew that they should have
U||   overtaken us before this. I've finally found them. They've passed us,
U||   and are now tacking around, waiting for us to cut off our power for a
U||   minute so that they can see us! They're heading right into the
U||   Fleet--they think they're safe, of course, but what a surprise they've
U||   got coming to them!"
U||   But it was not only the pirates who were to be surprised. Long before
U||   the pirate ship had come within extreme visibility range of the
U||   Triplanetary Fleet, it lost its invisibility and was starkly outlined
U||   upon the lookout plates of the three fugitives. For a few seconds the
U||   pirate craft seemed unchanged, then it began to glow redly, with a red
U||   that seemed to become darker as it grew stronger. Then the sharp
U||   outlines blurred, puffs of air burst outward, and the metal of the hull
U||   became a viscous, fluid-like something, flowing away in a long, red
U||   streamer into seemingly empty space. Costigan turned his ultra-gaze
U||   into that space and saw that it was actually far from empty. There lay
U||   a vast something, formless and indefinite even to his sub-ethereal
U||   vision; a something into which the viscid stream of transformed metal
U||   plunged. Plunged, and vanished.
U||   Powerful interference blanketed his ultra-wave and howled throughout
U||   his body; but in the hope that some part of his message might get
U||   through he called Samms, and calmly and clearly he narrated everything
U||   that had just happened. He continued his crisp report, neglecting not
U||   the smallest detail, while their tiny craft was drawn inexorably toward
U||   a redly impermeable veil; continued it until their lifeboat, still
U||   intact, shot through that veil and he found himself unable to move. He
U||   was conscious, he was breathing normally, his heart was beating; but
U||   not a voluntary muscle would obey his will.
U||CHAPTER III
U||  Fleet Against Planetoid
U||   One of the newest and fleetest of the Law Enforcement Vessels of the
U||   Triplanetary League, the heavy cruiser Chicago, of the North American
U||   Division of the Tellurian Contingent, plunged stolidly through
U||   interplanetary vacuum. For five long weeks she had patrolled her
U||   allotted volume of space. In another week she would report back to the
U||   city whose name she bore, where her space-weary crew, worn by their
U||   long "trick" in the awesomely oppressive depths of the limitless void,
U||   would enjoy to the full their fortnight of refreshing planetary leave.
U||   She was performing certain routine tasks--charting meteorites, watching
U||   for derelicts and other obstructions to navigation, checking in
U||   constantly with all scheduled space-ships in case of need, and so
U||   on--but primarily she was a warship. She was a mighty engine of
U||   destruction, hunting for the unauthorized vessels of whatever power or
U||   planet it was, that had not only defied the Triplanetary League, but
U||   were evidently attempting to overthrow it; attempting to plunge the
U||   Three Planets back into the ghastly sink of bloodshed and destruction
U||   from which they had so recently emerged. Every space-ship within range
U||   of her powerful detectors was represented by two brilliant, slowly
U||   moving points of light; one upon a great micrometer screen, the other
U||   in the "tank"--the immense, three-dimensional, minutely cubed model of
U||   the entire Solar System.
U||   A brilliantly intense red light flared upon a panel and a bell clanged
U||   brazenly the furious signals of the sector alarm. Simultaneously a
U||   speaker roared forth its message of a ship in dire peril.
U||   "Sector alarm! N. A. T. Hyperion gassed with Vee-Two. Nothing
U||   detectable in space, but...."
U||   The half-uttered message was drowned out in a crackling roar of
U||   meaningless noise, the orderly signals of the bell became a hideous
U||   clamor, and the two points of light which had marked the location of
U||   the liner disappeared in widely spreading flashes of the same
U||   high-powered interference. Observers, navigators, and control officers
U||   were alike dumfounded. Even the captain, in the shell-proof,
U||   shock-proof, and doubly ray-proof retreat of his conning compartment,
U||   was equally at a loss. No ship or thing could possibly be close enough
U||   to be sending out interfering waves of such tremendous power--yet there
U||   they were!
U||   "Maximum acceleration, straight for the point where the Hyperion was
U||   when her tracers went out," the captain ordered, and through the fringe
U||   of that widespread interference he drove a solid beam, reporting
U||   concisely to G. H. Q. Almost instantly the emergency call-out came
U||   roaring in--every vessel of the Sector, of whatever class or tonnage,
U||   was to concentrate upon the point in space where the ill-fated liner
U||   had last been known to be.
U||   Hour after hour the great globe drove on at maximum acceleration,
U||   captain and every control officer alert and at high tension. But in the
U||   Quartermaster's Department, deep down below the generator rooms, no
U||   thought was given to such minor matters as the disappearance of a
U||   Hyperion. The inventory did not balance, and two Q. M. privates were
U||   trying, profanely, and without much success, to find the discrepancy.
U||   "Charged cells for model DF Lewistons, none requisitioned, on hand
U||   eighteen thous...." The droning voice broke off short in the middle of
U||   a word and the private stood rigid, in the act of reaching for another
U||   slip, every faculty concentrated upon something, imperceptible to his
U||   companion.
U||   "Come on, Cleve--snap it up!" the second commanded, but was silenced by
U||   a vicious wave of the listener's hand.
U||   "What!" the rigid one exclaimed. "Reveal ourselves! Why, it's ... Oh,
U||   all right.... Oh, that's it.... Uh-huh.... I see.... Yes, I've got it
U||   solid. Maybe I'll see you again some time. If not, so long!"
U||   The inventory sheets fell unheeded from his hand, and his fellow
U||   private stared after him in amazement as he strode over to the desk of
U||   the officer in charge. That officer also stared as the hitherto
U||   easy-going and gold-bricking Cleve saluted briskly, showed him
U||   something flat in the palm of his left hand, and spoke.
U||   "I've just got some of the funniest orders ever put out,
U||   Lieutenant"--his voice was low and intense--"but they came from 'way,
U||   'way up. I'm to join the brass hats in the Center. You'll know about it
U||   directly, I imagine. Cover me up as much as you can, will you?" And he
U||   was gone.
U||   Unchallenged he made his way to the control room, and his curt "urgent
U||   report for the Captain" admitted him there without question. But when
U||   he approached the sacred precincts of the Captain's own and inviolate
U||   room, he was stopped in no uncertain fashion by no less a personage
U||   than the Officer of the Day.
U||   " ... and report yourself under arrest immediately!" the O. D.
U||   concluded his brief but pointed speech.
U||   "You were right in stopping me, of course," the intruder conceded,
U||   unmoved. "I wanted to get in there without giving everything away, if
U||   possible, but it seems that I can't. Well, I've been ordered by Virgil
U||   Samms to report to the Captain, at once. See this? Touch it!" He held
U||   out a flat, insulated disk, cover thrown back to reveal a tiny golden
U||   meteor, at the sight of which the officer's truculent manner altered
U||   markedly.
U||   "I've heard of them, of course, but I never saw one before," and the
U||   officer touched the shining symbol lightly with his finger, jerking
U||   backward involuntarily as there shot through his whole body a thrilling
U||   surge of power, shouting into his very bones an unpronounceable
U||   syllable--the password of the Secret Service. "Genuine or not, it gets
U||   you to the Captain. He'll know, and if it's a fake you'll be breathing
U||   space in five minutes."
U||   Projector at the ready, the Officer of the Day followed Cleve into the
U||   Holy of Holies. There the grizzled four-striper touched the golden
U||   meteor lightly, then drove his piercing gaze deep into the unflinching
U||   eyes of the younger man. But that captain had won his high rank neither
U||   by accident nor by "pull"--he understood at once.
U||   "It must be an emergency," he growled, half-audibly, still staring at
U||   his lowly Q. M. clerk, "to make Samms uncover his whole organization."
U||   He turned and curtly dismissed the wondering O. D. Then: "All right!
U||   Out with it!"
U||   "Serious enough so that every one of us afloat has just received orders
U||   to reveal himself to his commanding officer and to anyone else, if
U||   necessary to reach that officer at once--orders never before issued.
U||   The enemy have been located. They have built a base, and have ships
U||   better than our best. Base and ships cannot be seen nor detected by any
U||   ether wave. However, the Service has been experimenting for years with
U||   a new type of communicator beam; and, while pretty crude yet, it was
U||   given to us when the Dione went out without leaving a trace. One of our
U||   men was in the Hyperion, managed to stay alive, and has been sending
U||   data. I am instructed to attach my new phone set to one of the
U||   universal plates in your conning room, and to see what I can find."
U||   "Go to it!" The captain waved his hand and the operative bent to his
U||   task.
U||   "Commanders of all vessels of the Fleet!" The Headquarters speaker,
U||   receiver sealed upon the wave-length of the Admiral of the Fleet, broke
U||   the long silence. "All vessels, in sectors L to R, inclusive, will
U||   interlock location signals. Some of you have received, or will receive
U||   shortly, certain communications from sources which need not be
U||   mentioned. Those commanders will at once send out red K4 screens.
U||   Vessels so marked will act as temporary flagships. Unmarked vessels
U||   will proceed at maximum to the nearest flagship, grouping about it in
U||   regulation squadron cone in order of arrival. Squadrons most distant
U||   from objective point designated by flagship observers will proceed
U||   toward it at maximum; squadrons nearest it will decelerate or reverse
U||   velocity--that point must not be approached until full Fleet formation
U||   has been accomplished. Heavy and Light Cruisers of all other sectors
U||   inside the orbit of Mars ..." the orders went on, directing the
U||   mobilization of the stupendous forces of the League, so that they would
U||   be in readiness in the highly improbable event of the failure of the
U||   massed power of seven sectors to reduce the pirate base.
U||   In those seven sectors perhaps a dozen vessels threw out enormous
U||   spherical screens of intense red light, and as they did so their tracer
U||   points upon all the interlocked lookout plates also became ringed about
U||   with red. Toward those crimson markers the pilots of the unmarked
U||   vessels directed their courses at their utmost power; and while the
U||   white lights upon the lookout plates moved slowly toward and clustered
U||   about the red ones--the ultra-instruments of the Secret Service
U||   operatives were probing into space, sweeping the neighborhood of the
U||   computed position of the pirate's stronghold.
U||   But the object sought was so far away that the small spy-ray sets of
U||   the Secret Service men, intended as they were for close-range work,
U||   were unable to make contact with the invisible planetoid for which they
U||   were seeking. In the captain's sanctum of the Chicago, the operative
U||   studied his plate for only a minute or two, then shut off his power and
U||   fell into a brown study, from which he was rudely aroused.
U||   "Aren't you even going to try to find them?" demanded the captain.
U||   "No," Cleve returned shortly. "No use--not half enough power or
U||   control. I'm trying to think ... maybe ... say, Captain, will you
U||   please have the Chief Electrician and a couple of radio men come in
U||   here?"
U||   They came, and for hours, while the other ultra-wave men searched the
U||   apparently empty ether with their ineffective beams, the three
U||   technical experts and the erstwhile Quartermaster's clerk labored upon
U||   a huge and complex ultra-wave projector--the three blindly and with
U||   doubtful questions; the one with sure knowledge at least of what he was
U||   trying to do. Finally the thing was done, the crude but efficient
U||   graduated circles were set, and the tubes glowed redly as their solidly
U||   massed output was driving into a tight beam of ultra-vibration. "There
U||   it is, sir," Cleve reported, after some ten minutes of delicate
U||   manipulation, and the vast structure of the miniature world flashed
U||   into being upon his plate. "You may notify the fleet--co-ordinates H
U||   11.62, RA 124-31-16, and Dx about 173.2."
U||   The report made and the assistants out of the room, the captain turned
U||   to the observer and saluted gravely.
U||   "We have always known, sir, that the Service had men; but I had no idea
U||   that any one man could possibly do, on the spur of the moment, what you
U||   have just done--unless that man happened to be Lyman Cleveland."
U||   "Oh, it doesn't ..." the observer began, but broke off, muttering
U||   unintelligibly at intervals; then swung the visiray beam toward the
U||   earth. Soon a face appeared upon the plate, the keen but careworn face
U||   of Virgil Samms!
U||   "Hello, Lyman." His voice came clearly from the speaker, and the
U||   Captain gasped--his ultra-wave observer and sometime clerk was Lyman
U||   Cleveland himself, probably the greatest living expert in beam
U||   transmission! "I knew that you'd do something, if it could be done. How
U||   about it--can the others install similar sets on their ships? I'm
U||   betting that they can't."
U||   "Probably not," Cleveland frowned in thought. "This is a patchwork
U||   affair, made of gunny-sacks and hay-wire. I'm holding it together by
U||   main strength and awkwardness, and even at that it's apt to go to
U||   pieces any minute."
U||   "Can you rig it up for photography?"
U||   "I think so. Just a minute--yes, I can. Why?"
U||   "Because there's something going on out there that neither we nor the
U||   so-called pirates know anything about. The Admiralty seems to think
U||   that it's the Jovians again, but we don't see how it can be--if it is,
U||   they have developed a lot of stuff that none of our agents has even
U||   suspected," and he recounted briefly what Costigan had reported to him,
U||   concluding: "Then there was a burst of interference--on the ultra-band,
U||   mind you--and I've heard nothing from him since. Therefore I want you
U||   to stay out of the battle entirely. Stay as far away from it as you can
U||   and still get good pictures of everything that happens. I will see that
U||   orders are issued to the Chicago to that effect."
U||   "But listen...."
U||   "Those are orders!" snapped Samms. "It is of the utmost importance that
U||   we know every detail of what is going to happen. The answer is
U||   pictures. The only possibility of obtaining pictures is that machine
U||   you have just developed. If the fleet wins, nothing will be lost. If
U||   the fleet loses--and I am not half as confident of success as the
U||   Admiral is--the Chicago doesn't carry enough power to decide the issue,
U||   and we will have the pictures to study, which is all-important.
U||   Besides, we've probably lost Conway Costigan to-day, and we don't want
U||   to lose you, too."
U||   Cleveland remained silent, pondering this startling news, but the
U||   grizzled Captain, veteran of the Fourth Jovian War that he was, was not
U||   convinced.
U||   "We'll blow them out of space, Mr. Samms!" he declared.
U||   "You just think you will, Captain. I have suggested, as forcibly as
U||   possible, that the general attack be withheld until after a thorough
U||   investigation is made, but the Admiralty will not listen. They see the
U||   advisability of withdrawing a camera ship, but that is as far as they
U||   will go."
U||   "And that's plenty far enough!" growled the Chicago's commander, as the
U||   beam snapped off. "Mr. Cleveland, I don't like the idea of running away
U||   under fire, and I won't do it without direct orders from the Admiral."
U||   "Of course you won't--that's why you are going...."
U||   He was interrupted by a voice from the Headquarters speaker. The
U||   captain stepped up to the plate and, upon being recognized, he received
U||   the exact orders which had been requested by the Chief of the Secret
U||   Service--now not as secret as it had been heretofore.
U||   Thus it was that the Chicago reversed her acceleration, cut off her red
U||   screen, and fell rapidly behind, while the vessels following her in
U||   their loose cone formation shot away toward another crimson-flaring
U||   leader. Farther and farther back she dropped, back to the limiting
U||   range of the ultra-cameras upon which Cleveland and his highly trained
U||   assistants were furiously and unremittingly at work. And during all
U||   this time the forces of the seven sectors had been concentrating. The
U||   pilot vessels, with their flaming red screens, each followed by a cone
U||   of space-ships, drew closer and closer together, approaching the
U||   Fearless--the British super-dreadnaught which was to be the flagship of
U||   the Fleet--the mightiest and heaviest space-ship which had yet lifted
U||   her stupendous mass into the ether.
U||   Now, systematically and precisely, the great Cone of Battle was coming
U||   into being; a formation developed during the Jovian Wars while the
U||   forces of the Three Planets were fighting in space for their very
U||   civilizations' existence, and one never used since the last
U||   space-fleets of Jupiter's murderous hordes had been wiped out.
U||   The mouth of that enormous hollow cone was a ring of scout patrols, the
U||   smallest and most agile vessels of the fleet. Behind them came a
U||   somewhat smaller ring of light cruisers, then rings of heavy cruisers
U||   and of light battleships, and finally of heavy battleships. At the apex
U||   of the cone, protected by all the other vessels of the formation and in
U||   best position to direct the battle, was the flagship. In this formation
U||   every vessel was free to use her every weapon, with a minimum of danger
U||   to her sister ships; and yet, when the gigantic main projectors were
U||   operated along the axis of the formation, from the entire vast circle
U||   of the cone's mouth there flamed a cylindrical field of force of such
U||   intolerable intensity that in it no conceivable substance could endure
U||   for a moment!
U||   The artificial planet of metal was now close enough so that it was
U||   visible to the ultra-vision of the Secret Service men, so plainly
U||   visible that the warships of the pirates were seen issuing from the
U||   enormous air-locks. As each vessel shot out into space it sped straight
U||   for the approaching fleet without waiting to go into any
U||   formation--gray Roger believed his structures invisible to Triplanetary
U||   eyes, thought that the presence of the fleet was the result of
U||   mathematical calculations, and was convinced that his mighty vessels of
U||   the void would destroy even that vast fleet without themselves becoming
U||   known. He was wrong. The foremost globes were allowed actually to enter
U||   the mouth of that conical trap before an offensive move was made. Then
U||   the vice-admiral in command of the fleet touched a button, and
U||   simultaneously every generator in every Triplanetary vessel burst into
U||   furious activity. Instantly the hollow volume of the immense cone
U||   became a coruscating hell of resistless energy, an inferno which, with
U||   the velocity of light, extended itself into a far-reaching cylinder of
U||   rapacious destruction. Ether-waves they were, it is true, but
U||   vibrations driven with such fierce intensity that the screens of
U||   deflection surrounding the pirate vessels could not handle even a
U||   fraction of their awful power. Invisibility lost, their defensive
U||   screens flared briefly; but even the enormous force backing Roger's
U||   inventions, greater far than that of any single Triplanetary vessel,
U||   could not hold off the incredible violence of the massed attack of the
U||   hundreds of mighty vessels composing the Fleet. Their defensive screens
U||   flared briefly, then went down; their great spherical hulls first
U||   glowing red, then shining white, then in a brief moment exploding into
U||   flying masses of red hot, molten, and gaseous metal.
U||   A full two-thirds of Roger's force was caught in that raging,
U||   incandescent beam; caught and obliterated: but the remainder did not
U||   retreat to the planetoid. Darting out around the edge of the cone at a
U||   stupendous acceleration, they attacked its flanks and the engagement
U||   became general. But now, since enough beams were kept upon each ship of
U||   the enemy so that invisibility could not be restored, each Triplanetary
U||   war vessel could attack with full efficiency. Magnesium flares and
U||   star-shells illuminated space for a thousand miles, and from every unit
U||   of both fleets was being hurled every item of solid, explosive, and
U||   vibratory destruction known to the highly scientific warfare of that
U||   age. Offensive beams, rods and daggers of frightful power struck and
U||   were neutralized by defensive screens equally capable; the long range
U||   and furious dodging made ordinary solid or high-explosive projectiles
U||   useless; and both sides were filling all space with such a volume of
U||   blanketing frequencies that such radio-dirigible torpedoes as were
U||   launched could not be controlled, but darted madly and erratically
U||   hither and thither, finally to be exploded harmlessly in mid-space by
U||   the touch of some fiercely insistent, probing beam of force.
U||   Individually, however, the pirate vessels were far more powerful than
U||   those of the fleet, and that superiority soon began to make itself
U||   felt. The power of the smaller ships began to fail as their
U||   accumulators became discharged under the awful drain of the battle, and
U||   vessel after vessel of the Triplanetary fleet was hurled into
U||   nothingness by the concentrated blasts of the pirates' rays. But the
U||   Triplanetary forces had one great advantage. In furious haste the
U||   Secret Service men had been altering the controls of the
U||   radio-dirigible torpedoes, so that they would respond to ultra-wave
U||   control; and, few in number though they were, each was highly
U||   effective.
U||   A hard-eyed observer, face almost against his plate and both hands and
U||   both feet manipulating controls, hurled the first torpedo. Propelling
U||   rockets viciously aflame, it twisted and looped around the incandescent
U||   rods of destruction so thickly and starkly outlined, under perfect
U||   control; unaffected by the hideous distortion of all ether-borne
U||   signals. Through a pirate screen it went, and under the terrific blast
U||   of its detonation one entire panel of the stricken battleship vanished,
U||   crumpled and broken. It should have been out, cold--but, to the
U||   amazement of the observers, it kept on fighting with scarcely lessened
U||   power! Three more of the frightful space-bombs had to be exploded in
U||   it--it had to be reduced to junk--before its terrible rays went out;
U||   Not a man in that great fleet had even an inkling of the truth; that
U||   those great vessels, those terrible engines of destruction, did not
U||   contain a single living creature: that they were manned and fought by
U||   automatons; robots controlled by keen-eyed, space-hardened veterans
U||   inside the planetoid so distant by means of tight, interference-proof
U||   communicator beams!
U||   But they were to receive an inkling of it. As ship after ship of the
U||   pirate fleet was blown to pieces, Roger realized that his navy was
U||   beaten, and forthwith all his surviving vessels darted toward the apex
U||   of the cone, where the heaviest battleships were stationed. There each
U||   hurled itself upon a Triplanetary warship, crashing to its own
U||   destruction, but in that destruction insuring the loss of one of the
U||   heaviest vessels of the enemy. Thus passed the Fearless, and twenty of
U||   the finest space-ships of the fleet as well. But the ranking officer
U||   assumed command, the war-cone was re-formed, and, yawning maw to the
U||   fore, the great formation shot toward the pirate stronghold, now near
U||   at hand. It again launched its stupendous cylinder of annihilation, but
U||   even as the mighty defensive screens of the planetoid flared into
U||   incandescently furious defense, the battle was interrupted and pirates
U||   and Triplanetarians learned alike that they were not alone in the
U||   ether.
U||   Space became suffused with a redly impenetrable opacity, and through
U||   that indescribable pall there came reaching huge arms of force
U||   incredible; writhing, coruscating beams of power which glowed a
U||   baleful, although almost imperceptible, red. A vessel of unheard-of
U||   armament and power, hailing from a distant solar system of the Galaxy,
U||   had come to rest in that space. For months her commander had been
U||   investigating sun after sun in quest of one precious substance. Now his
U||   detectors had found it; and, feeling neither fear of Triplanetarian
U||   weapons nor reluctance to sacrifice those thousands of Triplanetarian
U||   lives, he was about to take it!
U||CHAPTER IV
U||  Within the Red Veil
U||   Nevia, the home planet of the marauding space-ship, would have appeared
U||   peculiar indeed to Terrestrial senses. High in the deep red heavens a
U||   fervent blue sun poured down its flood of brilliant purplish light upon
U||   a world of water. Not a cloud was to be seen in that flaming sky, and
U||   through that dustless atmosphere the eye could see the horizon--a
U||   horizon three times as distant as the one to which we are
U||   accustomed--with a distinctness and clarity impossible in our Terra's
U||   dust-filled air. As that mighty sun dropped below the horizon the sky
U||   would fill suddenly with clouds and rain would fall violently and
U||   steadily until midnight. Then the clouds would vanish as suddenly as
U||   they had come into being, the torrential downpour would cease, and,
U||   through that huge world's wonderfully transparent, gaseous envelope,
U||   the full glory of the firmament would be revealed. Not the firmament as
U||   we know it--for that hot blue sun and Nevia, her one planet-child, were
U||   many light-years distant from Old Sol and his numerous brood--but a
U||   strange and glorious firmament containing not one constellation
U||   familiar to earthly eyes.
U||   Many bridges and more tubes extended through the air from building to
U||   building, and the watery "streets" teemed with surface craft, and with
U||   submarines.
U||   Out of the vacuum of space a fish-shaped vessel of the void--the vessel
U||   that was shortly to attack so boldly both the massed fleet of
U||   Triplanetary and Roger's planetoid--plunged into the rarefied outer
U||   atmosphere, and crimson beams of force tore shriekingly the thin air as
U||   it braked its terrific speed. A third of the circumference of Nevia's
U||   mighty globe was traversed before the velocity of the craft could be
U||   reduced sufficiently to make a landing possible. Then, approaching the
U||   twilight zone, the vessel dived vertically downward, and it became
U||   evident that Nevia was neither entirely aqueous nor devoid of
U||   intelligent life. For the blunt nose of the space-ship was pointing
U||   toward what was evidently a half-submerged city, a city whose buildings
U||   were flat-topped, hexagonal towers, exactly alike in size, shape,
U||   color, and material. These buildings were arranged as the cells of a
U||   honeycomb would be if each cell were separated from its neighbors by a
U||   relatively narrow channel of water, and all were built of the same
U||   white metal. Many bridges and more tubes extended through the air from
U||   building to building, and the watery "streets" teemed with surface
U||   craft, and with submarines.
U||   The pilot, stationed immediately below the conical prow of the
U||   space-ship, peered intently through the thick windows of crystal-clear
U||   metal which afforded unobstructed vision in every direction except
U||   vertically upward and behind him. His four huge and contractile eyes
U||   were active, each operating independently in sending its own message to
U||   his peculiar but capable brain. One was watching the instruments, the
U||   others scanned narrowly the immense, swelling curve of the ship's
U||   belly, the water upon which his vessel was to land, and the floating
U||   dock to which it was to be moored. Four hands--if hands they could be
U||   called--manipulated levers and wheels with infinite delicacy of touch,
U||   and with scarcely a splash the immense mass of the Nevian sky-wanderer
U||   struck the water and glided to a stop within a foot of its exact berth.
U||   Four mooring bars dropped neatly into their sockets and the
U||   captain-pilot, after locking his controls in neutral, released his
U||   safety straps and leaped lightly from his padded bench to the floor.
U||   Scuttling across the floor and down a runway upon his four short,
U||   powerful, heavily scaled legs, he slipped smoothly into the water and
U||   flashed away, far below the surface. For Nevians are true amphibians.
U||   Their blood is cold; they use with equal comfort and efficiency gills
U||   and lungs for breathing; their scaly bodies are equally at home in the
U||   water or in the air; their broad, flat feet serve equally well for
U||   running about upon a solid surface or for driving their stream-lined
U||   bodies through the water at a pace few of our fishes can equal.
U||   Through the water the Nevian commander darted along, steering his
U||   course accurately by means of his short, vaned tail. Through an opening
U||   in a wall he sped and along a submarine hallway, emerging upon a broad
U||   ramp. He scurried up the incline and into an elevator which lifted him
U||   to the top floor of the hexagon, directly into the office of the
U||   Secretary of Commerce of all Nevia.
U||   "Welcome, Captain Nerado!" The Secretary waved a tentacular arm and the
U||   visitor sprang lightly upon a softly cushioned bench, where he lay at
U||   ease, facing the official across his low, flat "desk." "We congratulate
U||   you upon the success of your final trial flight. We received all your
U||   reports, even while you were traveling with many times the velocity of
U||   light. With the last difficulties overcome, you are now ready to
U||   start?"
U||   "We are ready," the captain-scientist replied, soberly. "Mechanically,
U||   the ship is as nearly perfect as our finest minds can make her. She is
U||   stocked for two years. All the iron-bearing suns within reach have been
U||   plotted. Everything is ready except the iron. Of course the Council
U||   refused to allow us any of the national supply--how much were you able
U||   to purchase for us in the market?"
U||   "Nearly ten pounds...."
U||   "Ten pounds! Why, the securities we left with you could not have bought
U||   two pounds, even at the price then prevailing!"
U||   "No, but you have friends. Many of us believe in you, and have dipped
U||   into our own resources. You and your fellow scientists of the
U||   expedition have each contributed his entire personal fortune; why
U||   should not some of the rest of us also contribute, as private
U||   citizens?"
U||   "Wonderful--we thank you. Ten pounds!" The captain's great triangular
U||   eyes glowed with an intense violet light. "A full year of cruising. But
U||   ... what if, after all, we should be wrong?"
U||   "In that case you shall have consumed ten pounds of irreplaceable
U||   metal." The Secretary was unmoved. "That is the viewpoint of the
U||   Council and of almost everyone else. It is not the waste of treasure
U||   they object to; it is the fact that ten pounds of iron will be forever
U||   lost."
U||   "A high price truly," the Columbus of Nevia assented, "And after all, I
U||   may be wrong."
U||   "You probably are--of course you are wrong," his host made a startling
U||   answer. "It is practically certain--it is almost a demonstrable
U||   mathematical fact--that no other sun within hundreds of thousands of
U||   light-years of our own has a planet. In all probability Nevia is the
U||   only planet in the entire Universe. We are the only intelligent life in
U||   the Universe. But there is one chance in numberless millions that,
U||   somewhere with the cruising range of your newly perfected space-ship,
U||   there may be an iron-bearing planet upon which you can effect a
U||   landing, and it is upon that infinitesimal chance that some of us are
U||   staking a portion of our wealth. We expect no return whatever, but if
U||   you should by some miracle happen to find stores of iron somewhere in
U||   space, what then? Deep seas being made shallow, civilization extending
U||   itself over the globe, science advancing by leaps and bounds, Nevia
U||   becoming populated as she should be peopled--that, my friend, is a
U||   chance well worth taking!"
U||   The Secretary called in a group of guards, who escorted the small
U||   package of priceless metal to the space-ship, and before the massive
U||   door was sealed the friends bade each other farewell.
U||   " ... I will keep in touch with you on the ultra-wave," the Captain
U||   concluded. "After all, I do not blame the Council for refusing to allow
U||   the other ship to go with us. Ten pounds of iron will be a fearful loss
U||   to the world. If we should find iron, however, see to it that the other
U||   vessel loses no time in following us."
U||   "No fear of that! If you find iron all space will be full of vessels,
U||   as soon as they can possibly be built--good-bye!"
U||   The last opening was sealed and Nerado shot the great vessel into the
U||   air. Up and up, out beyond the last tenuous trace of atmosphere, on and
U||   on through space it flew with ever-increasing velocity until Nevia's
U||   gigantic blue sun had been left so far behind that it became a splendid
U||   blue-white star. Then, projectors cut off to save the precious iron
U||   whose disintegration furnished them power, for week after week Captain
U||   Nerado and his venturesome crew of scientists drifted idly through the
U||   illimitable void. Sun after sun, as visible in their ultra-instruments
U||   as though the flying vessel were moving slower than light, they studied
U||   without finding a single planet.
U||   Three months passed. Nerado had already applied the slight power which
U||   was to swing the vessel around in an immense circle, back toward his
U||   native world. In that course he was rapidly approaching a sun, an
U||   ordinary G-type dwarf, whose spectrum revealed a blaze of lines of the
U||   precious element for which he was searching. Now at close observing
U||   range--he had long since abandoned his former eager habit of studying a
U||   sun as soon as it showed the tiniest perceptible disk in his most
U||   powerful telescope--he turned on his powerful visiray beam without
U||   enthusiasm, swung it upon that very commonplace sun, and shrieked aloud
U||   in exultation. Not only one planet had that yellowish luminary--it had
U||   six, seven, eight; yes, possibly nine or ten; and several of those
U||   planets were themselves apparently centers of attraction around which
U||   were circling other tiny worlds! Nerado thrilled with joy as he applied
U||   a full retarding force, and every creature aboard that great vessel had
U||   to peer into a plate or through a telescope, before he could believe
U||   that planets other than Nevia did in reality exist!
U||   Velocity checked to the merest crawl, as space-speed goes, and with
U||   electro-magnetic detector screens full out, the Nevian vessel crept
U||   toward our sun. Finally the detectors encountered an obstacle, a
U||   conductive substance which the patterns showed conclusively to be
U||   practically pure iron. Iron--an enormous mass of it--floating alone out
U||   in space! Without waiting to investigate the nature, appearance, or
U||   structure of the precious mass, Nerado ordered power into the
U||   converters and drove an enormous softening field of force upon the
U||   object--a force of such a nature that it would condense the metallic
U||   iron into an allotropic modification of much smaller bulk; a red,
U||   viscous, extremely dense and heavy liquid which could be stored
U||   conveniently in his tanks.
U||   No sooner had the precious fluid been stored away than the detectors
U||   again broke into an uproar. In one direction was an enormous mass of
U||   iron, scarcely detectable; in another a great number of smaller masses;
U||   in a third an isolated mass, comparatively small in size. Space seemed
U||   to be full of iron, and Nerado drove his most powerful beam toward
U||   distant Nevia and sent an exultant message.
U||   "We have found iron--easily obtained and in unthinkable quantity--not
U||   in fractions of milligrams, but in millions upon unmeasured millions of
U||   tons! Send our sister ship here as once!"
U||   "Nerado!" The captain was called to one of the observation plates as
U||   soon as he had opened his key. "I have been investigating the mass of
U||   iron now nearest us, the small one. It is an artificial structure, a
U||   small space-boat, and there are three creatures in it--monstrosities
U||   certainly, but they must possess some intelligence or they could not be
U||   navigating space."
U||   "What? Impossible!" exclaimed the chief explorer. "Probably, then, the
U||   other was--but no matter, we had to have the iron. Bring the boat in
U||   without converting it, so that we may study at our leisure both the
U||   beings and their mechanisms," and Nerado swung his own visiray beam
U||   into the emergency boat, seeing there the armored figures of Clio
U||   Marsden and the two Triplanetary officers.
U||   "They are indeed intelligent," Nerado commented, as he detected and
U||   silenced Costigan's ultra-beam communicator. "Not, however, as
U||   intelligent as I had supposed," he went on, after studying the peculiar
U||   creatures and their tiny space-ship more in detail. "They have immense
U||   stores of iron, yet use it for nothing other than building material.
U||   They apparently have a rudimentary knowledge of ultra-waves, but do not
U||   use them intelligently--they cannot neutralize even these ordinary
U||   forces we are now employing. They are of course more intelligent than
U||   the lower ganoids, or even than some of the higher fishes, but by no
U||   stretch of the imagination can they be compared to us. I am quite
U||   relieved--I was afraid that in my haste I might slay members of a
U||   highly developed race."
U||   The helpless boat, all her forces neutralized, was brought up close to
U||   the immense flying fish. There flaming knives of force sliced her
U||   neatly into sections and the three rigid armored figures, after being
U||   bereft of their external weapons, were brought through the air-locks
U||   and into the control room, while the pieces of their boat were stored
U||   away for future study. The Nevian scientists first analyzed the air
U||   inside the space-suits of the Terrestrials, then removed without ado
U||   the protective covering of the captives.
U||   Costigan--fully conscious through it all and now able to move a little,
U||   since the peculiar temporary paralysis was wearing off--braced himself
U||   for he knew not what shock, but it was needless; their grotesque
U||   captors were not torturers. The air, while somewhat less dense than
U||   earth's and of a peculiar odor, was eminently breathable, and even
U||   though the vessel was motionless in space, an almost-normal gravitation
U||   gave them a large fraction of their usual weight. The space suits were
U||   removed with care, and after the three had been relieved of their
U||   pistols and other articles which the Nevians thought might prove to be
U||   weapons, the strange paralysis was lifted entirely. The earthly
U||   clothing puzzled the captors immensely, but so strenuous were the
U||   objections raised to its removal, but they did not press the point, but
U||   fell back to study their find in detail.
U||   Then faced each other the representatives of the civilizations of two
U||   widely separated solar systems. The Nevians studied the human beings
U||   with interest and curiosity blended largely with loathing and
U||   repulsion; the three Terrestrials regarded the unmoving, expressionless
U||   "faces"--if those coned heads could be said to possess such
U||   things--with horror and disgust, as well as with other emotions, each
U||   according to his type and training. For to human eyes the Nevian is a
U||   fearful thing. Even to-day there are few Terrestrials--or Solarians for
U||   that matter--who can look at a Nevian, eye to eye, without feeling a
U||   creeping of the skin and experiencing a "gone" sensation in the pit of
U||   the stomach. The horny, wrinkled, drought-resisting Martian, whom we
U||   all know and rather like, is a hideous being indeed. The bat-eyed,
U||   colorless, hairless, practically skinless Venerian is worse. But they
U||   both are, after all, remote cousins of Terra's humanity, and we get
U||   along with them quite well whenever we are compelled to visit Mars or
U||   Venus. But the Nevians--
U||   The horizontal, flat, fish body is not so bad, even supported as it is
U||   by four, short, powerful, scaly, flat-footed legs; and terminating as
U||   it does in the weird, four-vaned tail. The neck, even, is endurable,
U||   although it is long and flexible, heavily scaled, and is carried in
U||   whatever eye-wringing loops, knots, or angles the owner considers most
U||   convenient or ornamental at the time. Even the smell of a Nevian--a
U||   malodorous reek of over-ripe fish--does in time become tolerable,
U||   especially if sufficiently disguised with creosote, which purely
U||   Terrestrial chemical is the most highly prized perfume of Nevia. But
U||   the head! It is that member that makes the Nevian so appalling to
U||   earthly eyes, for it is a thing utterly foreign to all Solarian history
U||   or experience. As most Tellurians already know, it is fundamentally a
U||   massive cone, covered with scales, based spearhead-like upon the neck.
U||   Four great sea-green, triangular eyes are spaced equidistant from each
U||   other about half way up the cone. The pupils are contractile at will,
U||   like the eyes of the cat, permitting the Nevian to see equally well in
U||   any ordinary extreme of light or darkness. Immediately below each eye
U||   springs out a long, jointless, boneless, tentacular arm; an arm which
U||   at its extremity divides into eight delicate and sensitive, but very
U||   strong, fingers. Below each arm is a mouth: a beaked, needle-tusked
U||   orifice of dire potentialities. Finally, under the overhanging edge of
U||   the cone-shaped head are the delicately frilled organs which serve
U||   either as gills or as nostrils and lungs, as may be desired. To other
U||   Nevians the eyes and other features are highly expressive, but to us
U||   they appear utterly cold and unmoving. Terrestrial senses can detect no
U||   changes of expression in a Nevian's "face." Such were the frightful
U||   beings at whom the three prisoners stared with sinking hearts.
U||   But if we human beings have always considered Nevians grotesque and
U||   repulsive, the feeling has always been mutual. For those "monstrous"
U||   beings are a highly intelligent and extremely sensitive race, and
U||   our--to us--trim and graceful human forms seems to them the very
U||   quintessence of malformation and hideousness.
U||   "Good Heavens, Conway!" Clio exclaimed, shrinking against Costigan as
U||   his left arm flashed around her. "What monstrosities! And they can't
U||   talk--not one of them has made a sound--suppose they can be deaf and
U||   dumb?"
U||   But at the same time Nerado was addressing his fellows.
U||   "What hideous, deformed creatures they are! Truly a low form of life,
U||   even though they do possess some intelligence. They cannot talk, and
U||   have made no signs of having heard our words to them--do you suppose
U||   that they communicate by sight? That those weird contortions of their
U||   peculiarly placed organs serve as speech?"
U||   Thus both sides, neither realizing that the other had spoken. For the
U||   Nevian voice is pitched so high that the lowest note audible to them is
U||   far above our limit of hearing. The shrillest note of a Terrestrial
U||   piccolo is to them so profoundly low that it cannot be heard.
U||   "We have much to do." Nerado turned away from the captives. "We must
U||   postpone further study of the specimens until we have taken aboard a
U||   full cargo of the iron which is so plentiful here."
U||   "What shall we do with them, sir?" asked one of the Nevian officers.
U||   "Lock them in one of the storage rooms?"
U||   "Oh, no! They might die there, and we must by all means keep them in
U||   good condition, to be studied most carefully by the fellows of the
U||   College of Science. What a commotion there will be when we bring in
U||   this group of strange creatures, living proof that there are other suns
U||   possessing planets; planets which are supporting organic and
U||   intelligent life! You may put them in three communicating rooms, say in
U||   the fourth section--they will undoubtedly require light and exercise.
U||   Lock all exits, of course, but it would be best to leave the doors
U||   between the rooms unlocked, so that they can be together or apart, as
U||   they choose. Since the smallest one, the female, stays so close to the
U||   larger male, it may be that they are mates. But since we know nothing
U||   of their habits or customs, it will be best to give them all possible
U||   freedom compatible with safety."
U||   Nerado turned back to his instruments and three of the frightful crew
U||   came up to the human beings. One walked away, waving a couple of arms
U||   in an unmistakable signal that the prisoners were to follow him. The
U||   three obediently set out after him, the other two guards falling
U||   behind.
U||   "Now's our best chance!" Costigan muttered, as they passed through a
U||   low doorway and entered a narrow corridor. "Watch that one ahead of
U||   you, Clio--hold him for a second if you can. Bradley, you and I'll take
U||   the two behind us--now!"
U||   Costigan stopped and whirled. Seizing a cable-like arm, he pulled the
U||   outlandish head down, the while the full power of his mighty right leg
U||   drove a heavy service boot into the place where scaly neck and head
U||   joined. The Nevian fell, and instantly Costigan leaped at the leader,
U||   ahead of the girl. Leaped; but dropped to the floor, again paralyzed.
U||   For the Nevian leader had been alert, his four eyes covering the entire
U||   circle of vision, and he had acted rapidly. Not in time to stop
U||   Costigan's first Berserk attack--the First Officer's reactions were
U||   practically instantaneous, and he moved like chain lightning--but in
U||   time to retain command of the situation. Another Nevian appeared and,
U||   while the stricken guard was recovering, all four arms wrapped tightly
U||   around his convulsively looping, knotting neck, the three helpless
U||   Terrestrials were lifted into the air and carried bodily into the
U||   quarters to which Nerado had assigned them. Not until they had been
U||   placed upon cushions in the middle room and the heavy metal doors had
U||   been locked upon them did they again find themselves able to use arms
U||   or legs.
U||   "Well, that's another round we lose," Costigan commented, cheerfully.
U||   "A guy can't mix it very well when he can neither kick, strike, nor
U||   bite. I expected those lizards to rough me up, but they didn't."
U||   "They don't want to hurt us. They want to take us home with them,
U||   wherever that is, as curiosities, like wild animals or something,"
U||   decided the girl, shrewdly. "They're pretty bad, of course, but I like
U||   them a lot better than I do Roger and his robots, anyway."
U||   "I think you have the right idea, Miss Marsden," Bradley rumbled.
U||   "That's it, exactly. I feel like a bear in a cage. I should think you'd
U||   feel worse than ever. What chance has an animal of escaping from a
U||   menagerie?"
U||   "These animals, lots. I'm feeling better and better all the time," Clio
U||   answered, and her serene bearing bore out her words. "You two got us
U||   out of that horrible place of Roger's, and I'm pretty sure that you
U||   will get us away from here, somehow or other. They may think we're
U||   stupid animals, but before you two and the Secret Service get done with
U||   them they'll have another think coming."
U||   "That's the old fight, Clio!" cheered Costigan. "I haven't got it
U||   figured out as close as you have, but I see you, eye to eye. These
U||   four-legged fish carry considerably heavier stuff than Roger did, I'm
U||   thinking; but they'll be up against something themselves pretty quick,
U||   that is NO light-weight, believe me!"
U||   "Do you know something, or are you just whistling in the dark?" Bradley
U||   demanded.
U||   "I know a little; not much. The Science Service has been working on a
U||   new ship for a long time; a ship to travel so much faster than light
U||   that it can go anywhere in the Galaxy and back in a month or so. New
U||   sub-ether drive, new power, new armament, new everything. Only bad
U||   thing about it is that it doesn't work so good yet--it's fuller of
U||   "bugs" than a Venerian's kitchen. It has blown up five times that I
U||   know of, and has killed twenty-nine men. But when they get it licked
U||   they'll have something!"
U||   "When, or if?" asked Bradley, pessimistically.
U||   "I said when!" snapped Costigan, his voice cutting like a knife. "When
U||   that gang goes after anything they get it, and when they get it it
U||   stays...." He broke off abruptly and his voice lost its edge. "Sorry.
U||   Didn't mean to get high, but I think we'll have help, if we can keep
U||   our heads up a while. And it looks good--these are first-class cages
U||   they've given us. All the comforts of home, even to lookout plates.
U||   Let's see what's going on, shall we?"
U||   After some experimenting with the unfamiliar controls Costigan learned
U||   how to operate the Nevian visiray, and upon the plate they saw the Cone
U||   of Battle hurling itself toward Roger's planetoid. They saw the pirate
U||   fleet rush out to do battle with Triplanetary's massed forces, and with
U||   bated breath they watched every maneuver of that epic battle to its
U||   savagely sacrificial end. And that same battle was being watched, also
U||   with intense interest, by the Nevians.
U||   "It is indeed a blood-thirsty combat," mused Nerado at his observation
U||   plate. "And it is peculiar--or rather, probably only to be expected
U||   from a race of such a low stage of development--that they employ only
U||   ether-borne forces. Warfare seems universal among primitive
U||   types--indeed, it is not so long ago that our own cities, few in number
U||   though they are, ceased fighting each other and combined against the
U||   semi-civilized fishes of the greater deeps."
U||   He fell silent, and for many minutes watched the furious battle between
U||   the two navies of the void. That conflict ended, he watched the
U||   Triplanetary fleet reform its battle cone and rush upon the planetoid.
U||   "Destruction, always destruction," he sighed, adjusting his power
U||   switches. "Since they are bent upon mutual destruction I can see no
U||   purpose in refraining from destroying all of them. We need the iron,
U||   and they are a useless race."
U||   He launched his softening, converting field of dull red energy. Vast as
U||   that field was, it could not encompass the whole of the fleet, but half
U||   of the lip of the gigantic cone soon disappeared, its component vessels
U||   subsiding into a sluggishly flowing stream of allotropic iron.
U||   Instantly the fleet abandoned the attack upon the planetoid and swung
U||   its cone around, to bring the flame-erupting axis to bear upon the
U||   inchoate something dimly perceptible to the ultra-vision of the Secret
U||   Service observers. Furiously the gigantic composite beam of the massed
U||   fleet was hurled, nor was it alone.
U||   For Roger in his floating citadel had realized at once that something
U||   untoward was happening; something altogether beyond even his knowledge
U||   and experience. He could not see anything--space was apparently
U||   empty--but he took his rays off the battleships and directed his every
U||   force just beyond the point in space where that red stream of
U||   transformed metal was disappearing. Then, for the first time in
U||   Triplanetary history, the forces of law and order joined hands with
U||   those of piracy and banditry against a common foe. Rods, beams, planes,
U||   and stilettoes of unbearable energy the doomed fleet launched, in
U||   addition to its main beam of annihilation, and Roger also hurled out
U||   into space every weapon at his command. Bombs, high-explosive shells,
U||   and deadly radio-dirigible torpedoes--all alike disappeared ineffective
U||   in that redly murky veil of nothingness. And the fleet was being
U||   melted. In quick succession the vessels flamed red, shrank together,
U||   gave out their air, and merged their component iron into the intensely
U||   red, sullenly viscous stream which was flowing through the impenetrable
U||   veil upon which Triplanetarians and pirates alike were directing their
U||   every possible weapon of offense.
U||   The last vessel of the Triplanetary armada converted and the resulting
U||   metal stored away in their capacious reservoirs, the Nevians turned
U||   their attention upon the stronghold of the pirates. There ensued a
U||   battle royal. For this vast planetoid was no feeble warship, depending
U||   solely upon the limited power available in its accumulators. It was the
U||   product of a really mighty brain, a brain re-enforced by the many
U||   perverted but powerful intellects which Roger had won over to his
U||   cause. It was powered by the incalculable force of cosmic radiation,
U||   powered to drive its unimaginable mass through space, against any
U||   possible attractions, for an indefinite number of years. It was armed
U||   and equipped to meet any emergency which Roger's coldly analytical mind
U||   had been able to foresee.
U||   The fact that the scientists of the Secret Service had discovered
U||   ultra-waves as yet unknown to him was unfortunate. That Service was
U||   itself unfortunate--impenetrable as it was, and incorruptible. He could
U||   learn nothing whatever about it. He had heard vague rumors of certain
U||   experiments--but even if they should discover something it would be too
U||   late to do them any good. Even without invisibility he would have no
U||   trouble in annihilating the massed Grand Fleet of the Triplanetary
U||   League. He would very shortly collect his tribute and disappear. And
U||   this new enemy, himself invisible and armed with heretofore unknown
U||   weapons of dire power, who was apparently unaffected by his beams--even
U||   he would discover that Roger the Great was no puny opponent. He would
U||   analyze those unknown forces, regenerate them, and hurl them back upon
U||   their senders.
U||   Thinking thus, the man of gray sat coldly motionless at his great
U||   multi-shielded desk, whose top was now swung up to become a board of
U||   massed and tiered instruments and controls. He shut off his offensive
U||   beams and surrounded the entire planetoid with the peculiarly rigid and
U||   substantial shield which had so easily warded off Costigan's fiercest
U||   attacks. And that shield was more effective than even its designer had
U||   supposed--gray Roger had builded even better than he knew. For the
U||   voracious and all-powerful converting beam of the Nevians, below the
U||   level of the ether though it was, struck that perfectly transparent
U||   wall and rebounded, defeated and futile. Struck and rebounded, then
U||   struck and clung hungrily, licking out over that impermeable surface in
U||   darting tongues of red flame as the surprised Nerado doubled and then
U||   quadrupled his power. Fiercer and fiercer drove in the Nevian flood of
U||   force until the whole immense globe of the planetoid was one
U||   scintillant ball of scarlet energy, but still the pirates' shield
U||   remained intact--at what awful drain of resource, Roger alone knew.
U||   "Here is the analysis of his screen, sir." A Nevian computer handed his
U||   chief a sheet of metal, upon which were engraved rows of symbols.
U||   "Ah, a sixth-phase polycyclic. A screen of that type was scarcely to
U||   have been expected from such a low form of life," Nerado commented, and
U||   rapidly adjusted the many dials and switches before him.
U||   As he did so the character of the clinging mantle of force changed.
U||   From red it flamed quickly through the spectrum, became unbearably
U||   violet, then disappeared; and as it disappeared the shielding wall
U||   began to give way. It did not cave in abruptly, but softened locally,
U||   sagging into a peculiar grouping of valleys and ridges--contesting
U||   stubbornly every inch of position lost. And gray Roger knew that the
U||   planetoid was doomed. His supposedly impregnable screen was failing in
U||   spite of its utmost measure of energy, and, that defense down, the
U||   citadel would not last a minute. Therefore he summoned a chosen few of
U||   his motley crew of renegade scientists and issued brief instructions.
U||   For minutes a host of robots toiled mightily, then a portion of the
U||   shield bulged out, extended into a tube beyond the attacking layers of
U||   force, and from it there erupted a beam of violence incredible. A beam
U||   behind which was every volt and ampere that the gigantic generators and
U||   accumulators of the planetoid could yield. A beam that tore screamingly
U||   through the ether; that by the very vehemence of its incalculable
U||   energy tore a hole through the redly impenetrable Nevian field and
U||   hurled itself upon the inner screen of the fish-shaped cruiser in
U||   frenzied incandescence. And was there, or was there not, a lesser
U||   eruption upon the other side--an almost imperceptible flash, as though
U||   something had shot from the doomed planetoid out into space?
U||   Nerado's looped neck straightened convulsively as his tortured drivers
U||   whined and shrieked at the terrific overload; but Roger's effort was
U||   far too intense to be long maintained. Even before his accumulators
U||   failed, generator after generator burned out, the defensive screen
U||   collapsed, and the red converter beam attacked voraciously the
U||   unresisting metal of those prodigious walls. Soon there was a terrific
U||   explosion as the pent-up air of the planetoid broke through its
U||   weakening container, and the sluggish river of allotropic iron flowed
U||   in an ever larger stream, ever faster.
U||   "It is well that we had an unlimited supply of iron." Nerado tied a
U||   knot in his neck and spoke in huge relief. "With but the seven pounds
U||   remaining of our original supply, I fear that it would have been
U||   difficult to parry that last thrust."
U||   "Difficult?" asked the second in command. "We would now be swimming in
U||   space. But what shall I do with this iron? Our reservoirs will not hold
U||   it all."
U||   "Seal up one or two of the lower storage compartments, to make room for
U||   this lot. Immediately it is loaded, we return to Nevia. There we shall
U||   install reservoirs in all the spare space, and come back here for
U||   more."
U||   The last drop of the precious liquid secured, the vessel moved away,
U||   sluggishly now because of its prodigious load. In their quarters in the
U||   fourth section the three Terrestrials, who had watched with strained
U||   attention the downfall and absorption of the planetoid, stared at each
U||   other with drawn faces. Clio broke the silence.
U||   "Oh, Conway, this is ghastly! It's ... it's just simply perfectly
U||   horrible!" she gasped, then recovered a measure of her customary spirit
U||   as she stared in surprise at Costigan's face. For it was thoughtful,
U||   his eyes were bright and keen--no trace of fear or disorganization was
U||   visible in any line of his hard young face.
U||   "It's not so good," he admitted frankly. "I wish I wasn't such a dumb
U||   cluck--if Lyman Cleveland or Ford Rodebush were here they could help a
U||   lot, but I don't know enough about any of their stuff to flag a
U||   hand-car. I can't even interpret that funny flash--if it really was a
U||   flash--that we saw."
U||   "Why bother about one little flash, after all that really did happen?"
U||   asked Clio, curiously.
U||   "You think Roger launched something? He couldn't have--I didn't see a
U||   thing," Bradley argued.
U||   "I don't know what to think. I've never seen anything material sent out
U||   so fast that I couldn't trace it with an ultra-wave--but on the other
U||   hand, Roger's got a lot of stuff that I never saw anywhere else.
U||   However, I don't see that it has anything to do with the fix we're in
U||   right now--but at that, we might be worse off. We're still breathing
U||   air, you notice, and if they don't blanket my wave I can still talk."
U||   He put both hands in his pockets and spoke.
U||   "Samms? Costigan. Put me on a recorder, quick--I probably haven't got
U||   much time," and for ten minutes he talked, concisely and as rapidly as
U||   he could utter words, reporting clearly and exactly everything that had
U||   transpired. Suddenly he broke off, writhing in agony. Frantically he
U||   tore his shirt open and hurled a tiny object across the room.
U||   "Wow!" he exclaimed. "They may be deaf, but they can certainly detect
U||   an ultra-wave, and the interference they can set up on it is enough to
U||   pulverize your bones. No, I'm not hurt," he reassured the anxious girl,
U||   now at his side, "but it's a good thing I had you out of circuit--it
U||   would have jolted you loose from six or seven of your back teeth."
U||   "Have you any idea where they're taking us?" she asked, soberly.
U||   "No," he answered flatly, looking deep into her steadfast eyes. "No use
U||   lying to you--if I know you at all you'd rather take it standing up.
U||   That talk of Jovians or Neptunians is the bunk--nothing like that ever
U||   grew in our Solarian system. All the signs say that we're going for a
U||   long, long ride!"
U||CHAPTER V
U||  Nevian Strife
U||   The Nevian space-ship was hurtling upon its way. Space-navigators both,
U||   the two Terrestrial officers soon discovered that it was even then
U||   moving with a velocity far above that of light and that it must be
U||   accelerating at a stupendous rate, even though to them it seemed
U||   stationary--they could feel only a gravitational force somewhat less
U||   than that of their native earth.
U||   Bradley, seasoned old campaigner that he was, had retired promptly as
U||   soon as he had completed a series of observations, and was sleeping
U||   soundly upon a pile of cushions in the first of the three
U||   inter-connecting rooms. In the middle room, which was to be Clio's,
U||   Costigan was standing very close to the girl, but was not touching her.
U||   His body was rigid, his face was tense and drawn.
U||   "You are wrong, Conway; all wrong," Clio was saying, very seriously. "I
U||   know how you feel, but it's false chivalry."
U||   "That isn't it, at all," he insisted, stubbornly. "It isn't only that
U||   I've got you out here in space, in danger and alone, that's stopping
U||   me. I know you and I know myself well enough to know that what we start
U||   now we'll go through with for life. It doesn't make any difference,
U||   that way, whether I start making love to you now or whether I wait
U||   until we're back on Tellus--I've been telling you for half an hour that
U||   for your own good you'd better pass me up entirely. I've got enough
U||   horsepower to keep away from you if you tell me to--not otherwise."
U||   "I know it, both ways, dear, but...."
U||   "But nothing!" he interrupted. "Can't you get it into your skull what
U||   you'll be letting yourself in for if you marry me? Assume that we get
U||   back, which isn't sure, by any means. But even if we do, some day--and
U||   maybe soon, too, you can't tell--somebody is going to collect fifty
U||   grams of radium for my head."
U||   "Fifty grams--and everybody knows that Samms himself is rated at only
U||   sixty? I knew that you were somebody, Conway!" Clio exclaimed,
U||   undeterred. "But at that, something tells me that any pirate will earn
U||   even that much reward several times over before he collects it. Don't
U||   be silly, dear heart--good-night."
U||   She tipped her head back, holding up to him her red, sweetly curved,
U||   smiling lips, and his eager arms, hitherto kept away from her by sheer
U||   force of will, swept around her in almost fierce intensity. As his hot
U||   lips met hers, her arms crept up around his neck and they stood,
U||   clasped together in the motionless ecstasy of love's first embrace.
U||   "Girl, girl, how I love you!" Costigan's voice was husky, his usually
U||   hard eyes were glowing with a tender light. "That settles that. I'll
U||   really live now, anyway, while...."
U||   "Stop it!" she commanded, sharply. "You're going to live until you die
U||   of old age--see if you don't. You'll simply have to, Conway!"
U||   "That's so, too--no percentage in dying now. All the pirates between
U||   Tellus and Andromeda couldn't take me after this--I've got too much to
U||   live for. Well, good-night, sweetheart, I'd better beat it--you need
U||   some sleep."
U||   The lovers' parting was not as simple and straightforward a procedure
U||   as Costigan's speech would indicate, but finally he did seek his own
U||   room and relaxed upon a pile of cushions, his stern visage transformed.
U||   Instead of the low metal ceiling he saw a beautiful, oval, tanned young
U||   face, framed in a golden-blonde corona of hair. His gaze sank into the
U||   depths of loyal, honest, dark-blue eyes; and looking deeper and deeper
U||   into those blue wells he fell asleep. Upon his face, too set and grim
U||   by far for a man of his years--the lives of Sector Chiefs of the T. S.
U||   S. are never easy, nor as a rule are they long--there lingered as he
U||   slept that newly acquired softness of expression, the reflection of his
U||   transcendent happiness.
U||   For eight hours he slept soundly, as was his wont; then, also according
U||   to his habit and training, he came wide awake, with no intermediate
U||   stage of napping.
U||   "Clio?" he whispered. "Awake, girl?"
U||   "Awake!" Her voice came through the ultra-phone, relief in every
U||   syllable. "Good heavens, I thought you were going to sleep until we got
U||   to wherever it is that we're going! Come on in, you two--I don't see
U||   how you can possibly sleep, just as though you were home in bed."
U||   "You've got to learn to sleep anywhere if you expect to keep in...."
U||   Costigan broke off as he opened the door and saw Clio's wan face. She
U||   had evidently spent a sleepless and wracking eight hours. "Good Lord,
U||   Clio, why didn't you call me?"
U||   "Oh, I'm all right, except for being a little jittery. No need of
U||   asking how you feel, is there?"
U||   "No--I feel hungry," he answered cheerfully. "I'm going to see what we
U||   can do about it--or say, guess I'll see whether they're still
U||   interfering on Samms' wave."
U||   He took out a small, insulated case and touched the contact stud
U||   lightly with his fingers. His arm jerked away powerfully.
U||   "Still at it," he gave the necessary explanation. "They don't seem to
U||   want us to talk outside, but his interference is as good as my
U||   talking--they can trace it, of course. Now I'll see what I can find out
U||   about our breakfast."
U||   He stepped over to the plate and shot its projector beam forward into
U||   the control room, where he saw Nerado lying, doglike, at his instrument
U||   panel. As Costigan's beam entered the room a blue light flashed on and
U||   the Nevian turned an eye and an arm toward his own small observation
U||   plate. Knowing that they were now in visual communication, Costigan
U||   beckoned an invitation and pointed to his mouth in what he hoped was
U||   the universal sign of hunger. The Nevian waved an arm and fingered
U||   controls, and as he did so a wide section of the floor of Clio's room
U||   slid aside. The opening thus made revealed a table which rose upon its
U||   low pedestal, a table equipped with three softly cushioned benches and
U||   spread with a glittering array of silver and glassware. Bowls and
U||   platters of dazzlingly white metal, narrow-waisted goblets of sheerest
U||   crystal; all were hexagonal, beautifully and intricately carved or
U||   etched in apparently conventional marine designs. And the table
U||   utensils of this strange race were peculiar indeed. There were tearing
U||   forceps of sixteen needle-sharp curved teeth; there were flexible
U||   spatulas; there were deep and shallow ladles with flexible edges; there
U||   were many other peculiarly curved instruments at whose uses the
U||   Terrestrials could no even guess; all having delicately fashioned
U||   handles to fit the long, slender fingers of the Nevians.
U||   But if the table and its appointments were surprising to the
U||   Terrestrials, revealing as they did a degree of culture which none of
U||   them had expected to find in a race of beings so monstrous, the food
U||   was even more surprising, although in another sense. For the wonderful
U||   crystal goblets were filled with a grayish-green slime of a nauseous
U||   and overpowering odor, the smaller bowls were full of living sea
U||   spiders and other such delicacies; and each large platter contained a
U||   fish fully a foot long, raw and whole, garnished tastefully with red,
U||   purple, and green strands of seaweed!
U||   Clio looked once, then gasped, shutting her eyes and turning away from
U||   the table, but Costigan flipped the three fish into a platter and set
U||   it aside before he turned back to the visiplate.
U||   "They'll go good fried," he remarked to Bradley, signaling vigorously
U||   to Nerado that the meal was not acceptable and that he wanted to talk
U||   to him, in person. Finally he made himself clear, the table sank down
U||   out of sight, and the Nevian commander cautiously entered the room.
U||   At Costigan's insistence, he came up to the plate, leaving near the
U||   door three guards armed with projectors in instant readiness. The
U||   operative then shot the beam into the galley of the pirate's lifeboat,
U||   suggesting that they should be allowed to live there. For some time the
U||   argument of arms and fingers raged--though not exactly a fluent
U||   conversation, both sides managed to convey their meanings quite
U||   clearly. Nerado would not allow the Terrestrials to visit their own
U||   ship--he was taking no chances--but after a thorough ultra-ray
U||   inspection he did finally order some of his men to bring into the
U||   middle room the electric range and a supply of Terrestrial food. Soon
U||   the Nevian fish were sizzling in a pan and the appetizing odors of
U||   coffee and of browning biscuit permeated the room. But at the first
U||   appearance of those odors the Nevians departed hastily, content to
U||   watch the remainder of the curious and repulsive procedure in their
U||   visiray plates.
U||   Breakfast over and everything made tidy and shipshape, Costigan turned
U||   to Clio.
U||   "Look here, girl; you've got to learn how to sleep. You're all in. Your
U||   eyes look like you'd been on a Martian picnic and you didn't eat half
U||   enough breakfast. You've got to sleep and eat to keep fit. We don't
U||   want you passing out on us, so I'll put out this light, and you'll lie
U||   down here and sleep until noon."
U||   "Oh, no; don't bother. I'll sleep to-night. I'm quite...."
U||   "You'll sleep now," he informed her, levelly. "I never thought of you
U||   being nervous, with Bradley and me on each side of you. We're both
U||   right here now, though, and we'll stay here. We'll watch over you like
U||   a couple of old hens with one chick between them. Come on; lie down and
U||   go bye-bye."
U||   Clio laughed at the simile, but lay down obediently. Costigan sat upon
U||   the edge of the great divan, holding her hand, and they chatted idly.
U||   The silences grew longer, Clio's remarks became fewer, and soon her
U||   long-lashed lids fell and her deep, regular breathing showed that she
U||   was sound asleep. The man stared at her, his very heart in his eyes. So
U||   young, so beautiful, so lovely--and how he did love her! He was not
U||   formally religious, but his every thought was a sincere prayer. If he
U||   could only get her out of this mess ... he wasn't fit to live on the
U||   same planet with her, but ... just give him one chance, just one!
U||   But Costigan had been laboring for days under a terrific strain, and
U||   had been going very short on sleep. Half hypnotized by his own mixed
U||   emotions and by his staring at the smooth curves of Clio's cheek, his
U||   own eyes closed and, still holding her hand, he sank down into the soft
U||   cushions beside her and into oblivion.
U||   Thus sleeping hand-in-hand like two children Bradley found them, and a
U||   tender, fatherly expression came over his face as he looked down at
U||   them.
U||   "Nice little girl, Clio," he mused, "and when they made Costigan they
U||   broke the mould. They'll do--about as fine a couple of kids as old
U||   Tellus ever produced. I could do with some more sleep myself." He
U||   yawned prodigiously, lay down at Clio's left, and almost instantly was
U||   himself asleep.
U||   Hours later, both men were awakened by a merry peal of laughter. Clio
U||   was sitting up, regarding them with sparkling eyes. She was refreshed,
U||   buoyant, ravenously hungry and highly amused. Costigan was amazed and
U||   annoyed at what he considered a failure in a self-appointed task;
U||   Bradley was calm and matter-of-fact.
U||   "Thanks for being such a nice bodyguard, you two," Clio laughed again,
U||   but sobered quickly. "I slept wonderfully well, but I wonder if I can
U||   sleep to-night without making you hold my hand all night?"
U||   "Oh, he doesn't mind doing that," Bradley commented.
U||   "Mind it!" Costigan exclaimed, and his eyes and his tone spoke volumes
U||   that his tongue left unsaid.
U||   They prepared and ate another meal, one to which Clio did full justice;
U||   and, rested and refreshed, had begun to discuss possibilities of escape
U||   when Nerado and his three armed guards entered the room. The Nevian
U||   scientist placed a box upon a table and began to make adjustments upon
U||   its panels, eyeing the Terrestrials attentively after each setting.
U||   After a time a staccato burst of articulate speech issued from the box,
U||   and Costigan saw a great light.
U||   "You've got it--hold it!" he exclaimed, waving his arms excitedly. "You
U||   see, Clio, their voices are pitched either higher or lower than
U||   ours--probably higher--and they've built an audio-frequency changer.
U||   He's nobody's fool, that fish!"
U||   Nerado heard Costigan's voice; there was no doubt of that. His long
U||   neck looped and angled in Nevian gratification, and, although neither
U||   side could understand the other, both knew that intelligent speech and
U||   hearing were attributes common to the two races. This fact altered
U||   markedly the relations between captors and captives. The Nevians
U||   admitted among themselves that the strange bipeds might be quite
U||   intelligent, after all; and the Terrestrials at once became more
U||   hopeful.
U||   "It isn't so bad, if they can talk," Costigan summed up the situation.
U||   "We might as well take it easy and make the best of it, particularly
U||   since we haven't been able to figure out any possible way of getting
U||   away from them. They can talk and hear, and we can learn their language
U||   in time. Maybe we can make some kind of a deal with them to take us
U||   back to our own system, if we can't make a break."
U||   The Nevians being as eager as the Terrestrials to establish
U||   communication, Nerado kept the newly devised frequency-changer in
U||   constant use. There is no need of describing at length the details of
U||   that interchange of languages. Suffice it to say that starting at the
U||   very bottom they learned as babies learn, but with the great advantage
U||   over babies of possessing fully developed and capable brains. And while
U||   the human beings were learning the tongue of Nevia, several of the
U||   amphibians (and incidentally Clio Marsden) were learning
U||   Triplanetarian; the two officers knowing well that it would be much
U||   easier for the Nevians to learn the logically-built common language of
U||   the Three Planets than to master the senseless intricacies of English.
U||   In a few weeks the two parties were able to understand each other after
U||   a fashion, by using a weird mixture of both languages. As soon as a few
U||   ideas had been exchanged, the Nevian scientists built transformers
U||   small enough to be worn collar-like by the Terrestrials, and the
U||   captives were allowed to roam at will throughout the great vessel; only
U||   the compartment in which was stored the dismembered pirate lifeboats
U||   being sealed to them. Thus it was that they were not left long in
U||   doubt, when another fish-shaped cruiser of the world was revealed upon
U||   their lookout plates in the awful emptiness of interstellar space.
U||   "That is our sister-ship, going to your Solarian system for a cargo of
U||   the iron which is so plentiful there," Nerado explained to his
U||   involuntary guests.
U||   "I hope the gang has got the bugs worked out of our super-ship,"
U||   Costigan muttered savagely to his companions as Nerado turned away. "If
U||   they have, that outfit will get something more than a load of iron when
U||   they get there!"
U||   More weeks passed; weeks during which a blue-white star separated
U||   itself from the infinitely distant firmament and began to show a
U||   perceptible disk. Larger and larger it grew, becoming bluer and bluer
U||   as the flying space-ship approached it, until finally Nevia could be
U||   seen, apparently close beside her parent orb.
U||   Heavily laden though the vessel was, such was her power that she was
U||   soon dropping vertically toward a large lagoon in the middle of the
U||   Nevian city. That bit of open water was strangely devoid of life, for
U||   this was to be no ordinary landing. Under the terrific power of the
U||   beams braking the descent of that unimaginable load of allotropic iron
U||   the water seethed and boiled; and instead of floating gracefully upon
U||   the surface of the sea, this time the huge ship of space sank like a
U||   plummet to the bottom. Having accomplished this delicate feat of
U||   docking the vessel safely in the immense cradle prepared for her,
U||   Nerado turned to the Terrestrials, who, now under guard, had been
U||   brought before him.
U||   "While our cargo of iron is being discharged, I am to take you three
U||   Tellurians to the College of Science, where you are to undergo a
U||   thorough physical and psychological examination. Follow me."
U||   "Wait a minute!" protested Costigan, with a quick and furtive wink at
U||   his companions. "Do you expect us to go through water, and at this
U||   frightful depth?"
U||   "Certainly," replied the Nevian, in surprise. "You are air-breathers,
U||   of course, but you must be able to swim a little, and this slight
U||   depth--but little more than thirty of your meters--will not trouble
U||   you."
U||   "You are wrong, twice," declared the Terrestrial, convincingly. "If by
U||   'swimming' you mean propelling yourself in or through the water, we
U||   know nothing of it. In water over our heads we drown helplessly in a
U||   minute or two, and the pressure at this depth would kill us instantly."
U||   "Well, I could take a lifeboat, of course, but that...." The Nevian
U||   Captain began, doubtfully, but broke off at the sound of a staccato
U||   call from his signal panel.
U||   "Captain Nerado, attention!"
U||   "Nerado," he acknowledged into a microphone.
U||   "The Third City is being attacked by the fishes of the greater deeps.
U||   They have developed new and powerful mobile fortresses mounting
U||   unheard-of weapons and the city reports that it cannot long withstand
U||   their attack. The inhabitants are asking for all possible help. Your
U||   vessel not only has vast stores of iron, but also mounts weapons of
U||   power. You are requested to proceed to their aid at the earliest
U||   possible moment."
U||   Nerado snapped out orders and the liquid iron fell in streams from
U||   wide-open ports, forming a vast, red pool in the bottom of the dock. In
U||   a short time the great vessel was in equilibrium with the water she
U||   displaced, and as soon as she had attained a slight buoyancy the ports
U||   snapped shut and Nerado threw on the power.
U||   "Go back to your own quarters and stay there until I send for you," the
U||   Nevian directed, and as the Terrestrials obeyed the curt orders the
U||   fish-shaped cruiser of space tore herself from the water and flashed up
U||   into the crimson sky.
U||   "What a barefaced liar!" Bradley exclaimed. The three, transformers cut
U||   off, were back in the middle room of their suite. "You can outswim an
U||   otter, and I happen to know that you came up out of the old DZ83 from a
U||   depth of...."
U||   "Maybe I did exaggerate a trifle," Costigan interrupted him, "but the
U||   more helpless he thinks we are the better for us. And we want to stay
U||   out of any of their cities as long as we can, because they may be hard
U||   places to escape from. I've got a couple of ideas, but they aren't ripe
U||   enough to pick yet.... Wow! how this bird's been traveling! We're there
U||   already! If he hits the water going like this, he'll split himself,
U||   sure!"
U||   With undiminished velocity they were flashing downward in a long slant
U||   toward the beleaguered Third City, and from the flying vessel there was
U||   launched toward the city's central lagoon a torpedo. No missile this,
U||   but a capsule containing a full ton of allotropic iron, which would be
U||   of more use to the Nevian defenders than millions of men. For the Third
U||   City was sore pressed indeed. Around it was one unbroken ring of
U||   boiling, exploding water--water billowing upward with searing, blinding
U||   bursts of superheated steam, or being hurled bodily in all directions
U||   in solid masses by the cataclysmic forces being released by the
U||   embattled fishes of the greater deeps. Her outer defenses were already
U||   down, and even as the Terrestrials stared in amazement another of the
U||   immense hexagonal buildings burst into fragments; its upper structure
U||   flying wildly into scrap metal, its lower half subsiding drunkenly
U||   below the surface of the boiling sea.
U||   The three Terrestrials involuntarily seized whatever supports were at
U||   hand as the Nevian space-ship struck the water with undiminished speed,
U||   but the precaution was needless--Nerado knew thoroughly his vessel, its
U||   strength and its capabilities. There was a mighty splash, but that was
U||   all. The artificial gravity was unchanged by the impact; to the
U||   passengers the vessel was still motionless and on even keel as, now a
U||   submarine, she snapped around like a very fish and attacked the rear of
U||   the nearest fortress.
U||   For fortresses they were; vast structures of green metal, plowing
U||   forward implacably upon immense caterpillar treads. And as they crawled
U||   they destroyed, and Costigan, exploring the strange submarine with his
U||   visiray beam, watched and marveled. For the fortresses were full of
U||   water; water artificially cooled and aerated, entirely separate from
U||   the boiling flood through which they moved. They were manned by fish
U||   some five feet in length. Fish with huge, goggling eyes; fish
U||   plentifully equipped with long, armlike tentacles; fish poised before
U||   control panels or darting about intent upon their various duties. Fish
U||   with intelligent brains, waging desperate war upon a hated foe!
U||   Nor was their warfare ineffectual. Their heat-rays boiled the water for
U||   hundreds of yards before them and their torpedoes were exploding
U||   against the Nevian defenses in one appallingly continuous concussion.
U||   But most potent of all was a weapon unknown to Triplanetary warfare.
U||   From a fortress there would shoot out, with the speed of a meteor, a
U||   long, jointed, telescopic rod, tipped with a tiny, brilliantly shining
U||   ball. Whenever this glowing tip encountered any obstacle, that obstacle
U||   disappeared in an explosion world-wracking in its intensity. Then what
U||   was left of the rod, dark now, would be retracted into the
U||   fortress--only to emerge again in a moment with a tip once more shining
U||   and potent.
U||   Nerado, apparently as unfamiliar with the peculiar weapon as were the
U||   Terrestrials, attacked cautiously; sending out far to the fore his
U||   murkily impenetrable screens of red. But the submarine was entirely
U||   non-ferrous, and its officers were apparently quite familiar with the
U||   Nevian beams which licked at and clung to the green walls in impotent
U||   fury. Through the red veil came stabbing tiny ball after brilliant
U||   ball, and only the most frantic dodging saved the space-ship from
U||   destruction in those first few furious seconds. And now the Nevian
U||   defenders of the Third City had secured and were employing the vast
U||   store of allotropic iron so opportunely delivered by Nerado.
U||   From the city there pushed out immense nets of metal, extending from
U||   the surface of the ocean to its bottom; nets radiating such terrific
U||   forces that the very water itself was beaten back and stood motionless
U||   in vertical, glassy walls. Torpedoes were futile against that wall of
U||   energy. The most fiercely driven rays of the fishes flamed incandescent
U||   against it, in vain. Even the incredible violence of a concentration of
U||   every available force-ball against one point could not break through.
U||   At that unimaginable explosion water was hurled for miles. The bed of
U||   the ocean was not only exposed, but in it there was blown a crater at
U||   whose dimensions the Terrestrials dared not even guess. The crawling
U||   fortresses themselves were thrown backward violently and the very world
U||   was rocked to its core by the concussion, but that iron-driven wall
U||   held. The massive nets swayed and gave back, and tidal waves hurled
U||   their mountainously destructive masses through the Third City, but the
U||   mighty barrier remained intact. And Nerado, still attacking two of the
U||   powerful tanks with his every weapon, was still dodging those flashing
U||   balls charged with the quintessence of destruction. The fishes could
U||   not see through the sub-ethereal veil, but all the rod-gunners of the
U||   two fortresses were combing it thoroughly with ever-lengthening,
U||   ever-thrusting rods, in a desperate attempt to wipe out the new and
U||   apparently all-powerful Nevian submarine, whose sheer power was slowly
U||   but inexorably crushing even their gigantic walls.
U||   "Well, I think that right now's the best chance we'll ever have of
U||   doing something for ourselves." Costigan turned away from the absorbing
U||   scenes pictured upon the visiplate and faced his two companions.
U||   "But what can we possibly do?" asked Clio, and
U||   "Whatever it is, we'll try it!" Bradley exclaimed.
U||   "Anything's better than staying here and letting them analyze us--no
U||   telling what they'd do to us," Costigan went on. "I know a lot more
U||   about things than they think I do. They never did catch me using my
U||   spy-ray--it's on an awfully narrow beam, you know, and uses almost no
U||   power at all--so I've been able to dope out quite a lot of stuff. I can
U||   open most of their locks, and I know how to run their small boats. This
U||   battle, fantastic as it is, is deadly stuff, and it isn't one-sided, by
U||   any means, either, so that every one of them, from Nerado down, seems
U||   to be on emergency duty. There are no guards watching us, or stationed
U||   where we want to go--our way out is open. And once out, this battle is
U||   giving us our best possible chance to get away from them. There's so
U||   much emission out there already that they probably couldn't detect the
U||   driving rays of the lifeboat, and they'll be too busy to chase us,
U||   anyway."
U||   "Once out, then what?" asked Bradley, eagerly.
U||   "We'll have to decide that before we start, of course. I'd say make a
U||   break back for our own Solarian system. We know the direction, from our
U||   own observation, and we'll have plenty of power."
U||   "But good Heavens, Conway, it's so far!" exclaimed Clio. "How about
U||   food, water, and air--would we ever get there?"
U||   "You know as much about that as I do. I think so, but of course
U||   anything might happen. This ship is none too big, is considerable
U||   slower than the big space-ship, and we're a long ways from home.
U||   Another bad thing is the food question. The boat is well stocked
U||   according to Nevian ideas, but it's pretty foul stuff for us to eat.
U||   However, it's nourishing, and we'll have to eat it, since we can't
U||   carry enough of our own supplies to the boat to last long. Even so, we
U||   may have to go on short rations, but I think that we'll be able to make
U||   it. On the other hand, what happens if we stay here? We will certainly
U||   strike trouble sooner or later, and we don't know any too much about
U||   these ultra-weapons. We are land-dwellers, and there is mighty little
U||   land on this planet. Then, too, we don't know where to look for what
U||   little land there is, and, even if we could find it, we know that it is
U||   all over-run with amphibians already. There's a lot of things that
U||   might be better, but they might be a lot worse, too. How about it? Do
U||   we try it or do we stay here?"
U||   "We try it!" exclaimed Clio and Bradley as one.
U||   "All right. I'd better not waste any more time talking--let's go!"
U||   Stepping up to the locked and shielded door, he took out a peculiarly
U||   built torch and pointed it briefly at the Nevian lock. There was no
U||   light, no noise, but the massive portal swung smoothly open. They
U||   stepped out and Costigan relocked and reshielded the entrance.
U||   "How ... what...?" Clio demanded, almost stuttering in her surprise.
U||   "I've been going to school for the last few weeks," Costigan grinned,
U||   "and I've picked up quite a few things here and there--literally as
U||   well as figuratively speaking. Snap it up, guys! Our armor is stored
U||   away with the pieces of the pirates' lifeboat, and I'll feel a lot
U||   better when we've got it on and have hold of a few fresh Lewistons."
U||   They hurried down corridors, up ramps, and along hallways, with
U||   Costigan's spy-ray investigating the course ahead for chance Nevians.
U||   Bradley and Clio were unarmed, but the secret agent had found a piece
U||   of flat metal and had ground it to a razor edge.
U||   "I think I can throw this thing straight enough and fast enough to chop
U||   off a Nevian's head before he can put a paralyzing ray on us," he
U||   explained grimly, but he was not called upon to show his skill with the
U||   improvised cleaver.
U||   As he had concluded from his careful survey, every Nevian was at some
U||   control or weapon, doing his part in that frightful combat with the
U||   denizens of the greater deeps. Their part was open, they were neither
U||   molested nor detected as they ran toward the compartment within which
U||   was sealed all their Terrestrial belongings. The door of that room
U||   opened, as had the other, to Costigan's knowing beam; and all three set
U||   hastily to work. They made up packs of food, filled their capacious
U||   pockets with emergency rations, recharged and buckled on Lewistons and
U||   automatics, donned their armor, and clamped into their external
U||   holsters a full complement of additional weapons.
U||   "Now comes the ticklish part of the business," Costigan informed them.
U||   His helmet was slowly turning this way and that, and the others knew
U||   that through his spy-ray goggles he was studying their route. "There's
U||   only one boat we stand a chance of reaching, and somebody's mighty apt
U||   to see us. There's a lot of detectors up there, and we'll have to cross
U||   a corridor full of communicator beams. There, that line's off ...
U||   scoot!"
U||   At his word they dashed out into the hall and hurried along for
U||   minutes, dodging to right or left as the leader snapped out orders.
U||   Finally he stopped.
U||   "Here's those beams I told you about. We'll have to roll under 'em.
U||   They're less than waist high--right there's the lowest one. Watch me do
U||   it, and when I give you the word, one at a time, you do the same. Keep
U||   low--don't let an arm or a leg get up into the path of a ray or they
U||   may see us."
U||   He threw himself flat, rolled upon the floor a yard or so, and
U||   scrambled to his feet. He gazed intently at the blank wall for a space,
U||   then:
U||   "Bradley--now!" he snapped, and the Interplanetary captain duplicated
U||   his performance.
U||   But Clio, unused to the heavy and cumbersome space-armor she was
U||   wearing, could not roll in it with any degree of success. When Costigan
U||   barked his order she tried, but stopped, floundering, almost directly
U||   below the invisible network of communicator beams. As she struggled one
U||   mailed arm went up, and Costigan saw in his ultra-goggles the faint
U||   flash as the beam encountered the interfering field. But already he had
U||   acted. Crouching low, he struck down the arm, seized it, and dragged
U||   the girl out of the zone of visibility. Then in furious haste he opened
U||   a nearby door and all three sprang into a tiny compartment.
U||   "Shut off all the fields of your suits, so that they can't interfere!"
U||   he hissed into the utter darkness. "Not that I'd mind killing a few of
U||   them, but if they start an organized search we're sunk. But even if
U||   they did get a warning by touching your glove, Clio, they probably
U||   won't suspect us. Our rooms are still shielded, and the chances are
U||   that they're too busy to bother much about us, anyway."
U||   He was right. A few beams darted here and there, but the Nevians saw
U||   nothing amiss and ascribed the interference to the falling into the
U||   beam of some chance bit of charged metal. With no further misadventures
U||   the Terrestrials gained entrance to the Nevian lifeboat, where
U||   Costigan's first act was to disconnect one steel boot from his armor of
U||   space. With a sigh of relief he pulled his foot out of it, and from it
U||   carefully poured into the small power-tank of the craft fully thirty
U||   pounds of allotropic iron!
U||   "I pinched it off them," he explained, in answer to amazed and
U||   inquiring looks, "and maybe you don't think it's a relief to get it out
U||   of that boot! I couldn't steal a flask to carry it in, so this was the
U||   only place I could put it in. These lifeboats are equipped with only a
U||   couple of grams of iron apiece, you know, and we couldn't get half-way
U||   back to Tellus on that, even with smooth going; and we may have to
U||   fight. With this much to go on, though, we could go to Andromeda,
U||   fighting all the way. Well, we'd better break away."
U||   Costigan watched his plate closely, and, when the maneuvering of the
U||   great vessel brought his exit port as far away as possible from the
U||   Third City and the warring citadels of the deep, he shot the little
U||   cruiser out and away. Straight out into the ocean it sped, through the
U||   murky red veil, and darted upward toward the surface. The three
U||   wanderers sat tense, hardly daring to breathe, staring into the
U||   plates--Clio and Bradley pushing at metal levers and stepping down hard
U||   upon metal brakes in unconscious efforts to help Costigan dodge the
U||   beams and rods of death flashing so appallingly close upon all sides.
U||   Out of the water and into the air the darting, dodging lifeboat flashed
U||   in safety; but in the air, supposedly free from menace, came disaster.
U||   There was a crunching, grating shock and the vessel was thrown into a
U||   dizzy spiral, from which Costigan finally leveled it into headlong
U||   flight away from the scene of battle. Watching the pyrometers which
U||   recorded the temperature of the outer shell, he drove the lifeboat
U||   ahead at the highest safe atmospheric speed while Bradley went to
U||   inspect the damage.
U||   "Pretty bad, but better than I thought," the captain reported. "Outer
U||   and inner plates broken away on a seam. Inter-wall vacuum all lost, and
U||   we wouldn't hold carpet-rags, let alone air. Any tools aboard?"
U||   "Some--and what we haven't got we'll make," Costigan declared. "We'll
U||   put a lot of distance behind us, then we'll fix her up and get away
U||   from here."
U||   "What are those fish, anyway, Conway?" Clio asked, as the lifeboat tore
U||   along. "The Nevians are bad enough, Heaven knows, but the very idea of
U||   intelligent and educated FISH is enough to drive one mad!"
U||   "You know Nerado mentioned several times the 'semi-civilized fishes of
U||   the greater deeps'?" he reminded her. "I gather that there are at least
U||   three intelligent races here. We know two--the Nevians, who are
U||   amphibians, and the fishes of the greater deeps. The fishes of the
U||   lesser deeps are also intelligent. As I get it, the Nevian cities were
U||   originally built in very shallow water, or perhaps were upon islands.
U||   The development of machinery and tools gave them a big edge on the
U||   fish; and those living in the shallow seas, nearest the islands,
U||   gradually became tributary nations, if not actually slaves. Those fish
U||   not only serve as food, but work in the mines, hatcheries, and
U||   plantations, and do all kinds of work for the Nevians. Those so-called
U||   'lesser deeps' were conquered first, of course, and all their races of
U||   fish are docile enough now. But the deep-sea breeds, who live in water
U||   so deep that the Nevians can hardly stand the pressure down there, were
U||   more intelligent to start with, and more stubborn besides. But the most
U||   valuable metals here are deep down--this planet is very light for its
U||   size, you know--so the Nevians kept at it until they conquered some of
U||   the deep-sea fish, too, and put 'em to work. But those high-pressure
U||   boys were nobody's fools. They realized that as time went on the
U||   amphibians would get further and further ahead of them in development,
U||   so they let themselves be conquered, learned how to use the Nevians'
U||   tools and everything else they could get hold of, developed a lot of
U||   new stuff of their own, and now they're out to wipe the amphibians off
U||   the slate completely, before they get too far ahead of them to handle."
U||   "And the Nevians are afraid of them, and want to kill them all, as fast
U||   as they possibly can," guessed Clio.
U||   "That would be the logical thing, of course," commented Bradley. "Got
U||   pretty nearly enough distance now, Costigan?"
U||   "There isn't enough distance on the planet to suit me," Costigan
U||   replied. "We'll need all we can get. A full diameter away from that
U||   crew of amphibians is too close for comfort--their detectors are keen."
U||   "Then they can detect us?" Clio asked. "Oh, I wish they hadn't hit
U||   us--we'd have been away from here long ago."
U||   "So do I," Costigan assented, feelingly. "But they did--no use
U||   squawking. We can rivet and weld those seams and pump out the shell,
U||   and we'd have to fill our air-tanks to capacity for the trip, anyway.
U||   And things could be a lot worse--we are still breathing air!"
U||   In silence the lifeboat flashed onward, and half of Nevia's mighty
U||   globe was traversed before it was brought to a halt, in the emptiest
U||   reaches of the planet's desolate and watery waste. Then in furious
U||   haste the two officers set to work, again to make their small craft
U||   sound and spaceworthy.
U||CHAPTER VI
U||  Worm, Submarine, and Freedom
U||   Since both Costigan and Bradley had often watched their captors at work
U||   during the long voyage from the Solar System to Nevia, they were quite
U||   familiar with the machine tools of the amphibians. Their stolen
U||   lifeboat, being an emergency craft, of course carried full repair
U||   equipment; and to such good purpose did the two officers labor that
U||   even before their air-tanks were fully charged, all the damage had been
U||   repaired.
U||   The lifeboat lay motionless upon the mirror-smooth surface of the
U||   ocean. Captain Bradley had opened the upper port and the three stood in
U||   the opening, gazing in silence toward the incredibly distant horizon,
U||   while powerful pumps were forcing the last possible ounces of air into
U||   the practically unbreakable storage cylinders. Mile upon strangely flat
U||   mile stretched that waveless, unbroken expanse of water, merging
U||   finally into the violent redness of the Nevian sky. The sun was
U||   setting; a vast ball of purple flame dropping rapidly toward the
U||   horizon. Darkness came suddenly as that seething ball disappeared, and
U||   the air became bitterly cold, in sharp contrast to the pleasant warmth
U||   of a moment before. And as suddenly clouds appeared in blackly banked
U||   masses and a cold, driving rain began to beat down in torrents.
U||   "Br-r-r, it's cold! Let's go in--Oh! Shut the door!" Clio shrieked, and
U||   leaped wildly down into the compartment below, out of Costigan's way,
U||   for he and Bradley also had seen slithering toward them the frightful
U||   arm of the Thing.
U||   Almost before the girl had spoken Costigan had leaped to the levers,
U||   and not an instant too soon; for the tip of that horrible tentacle
U||   flashed into the rapidly narrowing crack just before the door clanged
U||   shut. As the powerful toggles forced the heavy screw threads into
U||   engagement and drove the massive disk home into its bottle-tight,
U||   insulated seat, that grisly tip fell severed to the floor of the
U||   compartment and lay there, twitching and writhing with a loathsome and
U||   unearthly vigor. Two feet long the piece was, and larger than a strong
U||   man's leg. It was armed with spiked and jointed metallic scales, and
U||   instead of sucking disks it was equipped with a series of
U||   mouths--mouths filled with sharp metallic teeth which gnashed and
U||   ground together furiously, even though sundered from the horrible
U||   organism which they were designed to feed.
U||   The little submarine shuddered in every plate and member as monstrous
U||   coils encircled her and tightened inexorably in terrific, rippling
U||   surges eloquent of mastodonic power; and a strident vibration smote
U||   sickeningly upon Terrestrial eardrums as the metal spikes of the
U||   monstrosity crunched and ground upon the outer plating of their small
U||   vessel. Costigan stood unmoved at the plate, watching intently; hands
U||   ready upon the controls. Due to the artificial gravity of the lifeboat
U||   it seemed perfectly stationary to its occupants. Only the weird
U||   gyrations of the pictures upon the lookout screens showed that the
U||   craft was being shaken and thrown about like a rat in the jaws of a
U||   terrier; only the gauges revealed that they were almost a mile below
U||   the surface of the ocean already, and were still going downward at an
U||   appalling rate. Finally Clio could stand no more.
U||   "Aren't you going to do something, Conway?" she cried.
U||   "Not unless I have to," he replied, composedly. "I don't believe that
U||   he can really hurt us, and if I use a ray of any kind I'm afraid that
U||   it will kick up enough disturbance to bring Nerado down on us like a
U||   hawk after a chicken. However, if he takes us much deeper I'll have to
U||   go to work on him. We're getting down pretty close to our limit, and
U||   the bottom's a long way down yet."
U||   Deeper and deeper the lifeboat was dragged by its dreadful opponent,
U||   whose spiked teeth still tore savagely at the tough outer plating of
U||   the craft until Costigan reluctantly threw in his power switches.
U||   Against the full propellant thrust the monster could draw them no
U||   lower, but neither could the lifeboat make any headway toward the
U||   surface. The Terrestrial then turned on his rays, but found that they
U||   were ineffective. So closely was the creature wrapped around the
U||   submarine that his weapons could not be brought to bear upon it without
U||   melting the vessel's own outer skin.
U||   "What can it possibly be, anyway, and what can we do about it?" Clio
U||   asked.
U||   "I thought at first it was something like a devilfish, or possibly an
U||   overgrown starfish, but it's too flat, and has no body that I can see,"
U||   Costigan made answer. "It must be a kind of flat worm. That doesn't
U||   sound reasonable--the thing must be all of a hundred meters long--but
U||   there it is. The only thing left to do now, as I see it, is to try to
U||   boil him alive."
U||   He closed other circuits, diffusing a terrific beam of pure heat, and
U||   the water all about them burst into furious clouds of steam. The boat
U||   leaped upward as the metallic fins of the gigantic worm fanned vapor
U||   instead of water, but the creature neither released its hold nor ceased
U||   its relentlessly grinding attack. Minute after minute went by, but
U||   finally the worm dropped limply away--cooked through and through;
U||   vanquished only by death.
U||   "Now we've put our foot in it, clear to the knee!" Costigan exclaimed,
U||   as he shot the lifeboat upward at its maximum power. "Look at that! I
U||   knew that Nerado could trace us, but I didn't have any idea that they
U||   could. It's a good thing these ultra-vision plates don't need light to
U||   see by or we'd be 'spurlos versenkt' in a hurry!"
U||   Staring with Costigan into the plate, Bradley and the girl saw, not the
U||   Nevian sky-rover they had expected, but a fast submarine cruiser,
U||   manned by the frightful fishes of the greater deeps. It was coming
U||   directly toward the lifeboat, and even as Costigan hurled the little
U||   vessel off at an angle and then upward into the air one of the deadly
U||   offensive rods, tipped with its glowing ball of pure destruction,
U||   flashed through the spot where they would have been had they held their
U||   former course.
U||   But powerful as were the propellant forces and fiercely though Costigan
U||   applied them, the denizens of the deep clamped a tractor ray upon the
U||   flying vessel before it had gained a mile of altitude. Costigan aligned
U||   his every driving projector as his vessel came to an abrupt halt in the
U||   invisible grip of the beam, then experimented with various dials.
U||   "There ought to be some way of cutting that beam," he pondered audibly,
U||   "but I don't know enough about their system to do it, and I'm afraid to
U||   monkey around with things too much, because I might accidentally
U||   release the screens we've already got out, and they're stopping
U||   altogether too much stuff for us to do without them right now."
U||   He frowned as he studied the flaring defensive screens, now radiating
U||   an incandescent violet under the concentration of the forces being
U||   hurled against them by the warlike fishes, then stiffened suddenly.
U||   "I thought so--they can shoot 'em!" he exclaimed, throwing the lifeboat
U||   into a furious corkscrew turn, and the very air blazed into flaming
U||   splendor as a dazzlingly scintillating ball of energy sped past them
U||   and high into the air beyond.
U||   Then for minutes a spectacular battle raged. The twisting, turning,
U||   leaping airship, small as she was agile, kept on eluding the explosive
U||   projectiles of the fishes, and her screens neutralized and re-radiated
U||   the full power of the attacking beams. More--since Costigan did not
U||   need to think of sparing his iron, the ocean around the great submarine
U||   began furiously to boil under the full-driven offensive beams of the
U||   tiny Nevian ship. But escape Costigan could not. He could not cut that
U||   tractor beam and the utmost power of his drivers could not wrest the
U||   lifeboat from its tenacious clutch. And slowly but inexorably the ship
U||   of space was being drawn downward toward the ship of ocean's depths.
U||   Downward, in spite of the utmost possible effort of every projector and
U||   penetrator, and the two Terrestrial spectators, sick at heart, looked
U||   once at each other. Then they looked at Costigan, who, jaw hard set and
U||   eyes unflinchingly upon his plate, was concentrating his attack upon
U||   one turret of the green monster as they settled lower and lower.
U||   "If this is ... if our number is going up, Conway," Clio began,
U||   unsteadily.
U||   "Not yet, it isn't!" he snapped. "Keep a stiff upper lip, girl. We're
U||   still breathing air, and the battle's not over yet!"
U||   Nor was it; but it was not Costigan's efforts, mighty though they were,
U||   that ended the attack of the fishes of the greater deeps. The tractor
U||   beam snapped without warning, and so prodigious were the forces being
U||   exerted by the lifeboat that, as it hurled itself away, the three
U||   passengers were thrown violently to the floor, in spite of the powerful
U||   gravity controls. Scrambling up on hands and knees, bracing himself as
U||   best he could against the terrific forces, Costigan managed finally to
U||   force a hand up to his panel. He was barely in time; for even as he cut
U||   the driving power to its normal value the outer shell of the lifeboat
U||   was blazing at white heat from the friction of the atmosphere through
U||   which it had been tearing with such an insane acceleration!
U||   "Oh, I see--Nerado to the rescue," Costigan commented, after a glance
U||   into the plate. "I hope that those fish blow him clear out of the
U||   Galaxy!"
U||   "Why?" demanded Clio. "I should think that you'd...."
U||   "Think again," he advised her. "The worse Nerado gets licked the better
U||   for us. I don't really expect that, but if they can keep him busy long
U||   enough, we can get far enough away so that he won't bother about us any
U||   more."
U||   As the lifeboat tore upward through the air at the highest permissible
U||   atmospheric velocity Bradley and Clio peered over Costigan's shoulders
U||   into the plate, watching in absorbed interest the scene which was being
U||   kept in focus upon it. The Nevian ship of space was plunging downward
U||   in a long, slanting dive, her terrific beams of force screaming out
U||   ahead of her. The rays of the little lifeboat had boiled the waters of
U||   the ocean; those of the parent craft seemed literally to blast them out
U||   of existence. All about the green submarine there had been volumes of
U||   furiously-boiling water and dense clouds of vapor; now water and fog
U||   alike disappeared, converted into transparent superheated steam by the
U||   blasts of Nevian energy. Through that tenuous gas the enormous mass of
U||   the submarine fell like a plummet, her defensive screens flaming an
U||   almost invisible violet, her every offensive weapon vomiting forth
U||   solid and vibratory destruction toward the Nevian cruiser so high in
U||   the angry, scarlet heavens.
U||   For miles the submarine dropped, until the frightful pressure of the
U||   depth drove water into Nerado's beam faster than his forces could
U||   volatilize it. Then in that seething funnel there was waged desperate
U||   conflict. At that funnel's wildly turbulent bottom lay the submarine,
U||   now apparently trying to escape, but held fast by the tractor rays of
U||   the space-ship; at its top, smothered almost to the point of
U||   invisibility by billowing masses of steam, hung poised the Nevian
U||   cruiser.
U||   As the atmosphere had grown thinner and thinner with increasing
U||   altitude Costigan had regulated his velocity accordingly, keeping the
U||   outer shell of the vessel at the highest temperature consistent with
U||   safety. Now beyond measurable atmospheric pressure, the shell cooled
U||   rapidly and he applied full touring acceleration. At an appalling and
U||   constantly increasing speed the miniature space-ship shot away from the
U||   strange, red planet; and smaller and smaller upon the plate became its
U||   picture. Long since the great vessel of the void had plunged beneath
U||   the surface of the sea, more closely to come to grips with the vessel
U||   of the fishes; for a long time nothing of the battle had been visible
U||   save immense clouds of steam, blanketing hundreds of square miles of
U||   the ocean's surface. But just before the picture became too small to
U||   reveal details a few tiny dark spots appeared above the banks of cloud,
U||   now brilliantly illuminated by the rays of the rising sun--dots which
U||   might have been fragments of either vessel, blown bodily from the
U||   depths of the ocean and, riven asunder, hurled high into the air by the
U||   incredible forces at the command of the other.
U||   Nevia a tiny moon and the fierce blue sun rapidly growing smaller in
U||   the distance, Costigan swung his visiray beam into the line of travel
U||   and turned to his companions.
U||   "Well, we're off," he said, scowling. "I hope it was Nerado that got
U||   blown up back there, but I'm afraid it wasn't. He whipped two of those
U||   submarines that we know of, and probably half their fleet besides.
U||   There's no particular reason why that one should be able to take him,
U||   so it's my idea that we should get ready for great gobs of trouble.
U||   "They'll chase us, of course; and I'm afraid that with their immense
U||   power, they'll catch us."
U||   "But what can we do, Conway?" asked Clio.
U||   "Several things," he grinned. "I managed to get quite a lot of dope on
U||   that paralyzing ray and some of their other stuff, and we can install
U||   the necessary equipment in our suits easily enough."
U||   They removed their armor, and Costigan explained in detail the changes
U||   which must be made in the Triplanetary field generators. All three set
U||   vigorously to work--the two officers deftly and surely; Clio
U||   uncertainly and with many questions, but with undaunted spirit.
U||   Finally, having done all they could do to strengthen their position,
U||   they settled down to the watchful routine of the flight, with every
U||   possible instrument set to detect any sign of the pursuit they so
U||   feared.
U||CHAPTER VII
U||  The Hill
U||   Its atmosphere was withdrawn, the outer door opened, and he glanced
U||   across a bare hundred feet of space at the rocket-plane which, keel
U||   ports fiercely aflame, was braking her terrific speed to match the
U||   slower pace of the gigantic ship of war.
U||   The heavy cruiser Chicago hung motionless in space, thousands of miles
U||   distant from the warring fleets of space-ships so viciously attacking
U||   and so stubbornly defending the planetoid of the enemy. In the
U||   captain's sanctum Lyman Cleveland crouched tensely above his
U||   ultra-cameras, his sensitive fingers touching lightly their micrometric
U||   dials. His body was rigid, his face was set and drawn. Only his eyes
U||   moved: flashing back and forth between the observation plates and
U||   smoothly-running rolls which were feeding into the cameras the hardened
U||   steel tapes upon which were being magnetically recorded the frightful
U||   scenes of carnage and destruction there revealed.
U||   Silent and bitterly absorbed, though surrounded by staring officers,
U||   whose fervent, almost unconscious cursing was prayerful in its
U||   intensity, the visiray expert kept his ultra-instruments upon that
U||   awful struggle to its dire conclusion. Flawlessly those instruments
U||   noted every detail of the destruction of Roger's fleet, of the
U||   transformation of the armada of Triplanetary into an unknown fluid, and
U||   finally of the dissolution of the gigantic planetoid itself. Then
U||   furiously Cleveland drove his beams against the crimsonly opaque
U||   obscurity into which the peculiar, viscous stream of substance was
U||   disappearing. Time after time he applied his every watt of power, with
U||   no result. A vast volume of space, roughly ellipsodial in shape, was
U||   closed to him by forces entirely beyond his experience or
U||   comprehension. But suddenly, while his rays were still trying to pierce
U||   that impenetrable murk, it disappeared instantly and, without warning,
U||   the illimitable infinity of space once more lay revealed upon his
U||   plates and his beams flashed on and on through the void, unimpeded.
U||   "Back to Tellus, sir?" The Chicago's captain broke the strained
U||   silence.
U||   "I wouldn't say so, if I had the say." Cleveland, baffled and
U||   frustrate, straightened up and shut off his cameras. "We should report
U||   back as soon as possible, of course, but there seems to be a lot of
U||   wreckage out there yet, that we can't photograph in detail at this
U||   distance. A close study of it might help us a lot in understanding what
U||   they did and how they did it. I'd say that we should get close-ups of
U||   whatever is left, and do it right away, before it gets scattered all
U||   over space; but of course I can't give you orders."
U||   "You can, though," the captain made surprising answer. "My orders are
U||   that you are in command of this vessel."
U||   "In that case we will proceed at full emergency acceleration to
U||   investigate the wreckage," Cleveland replied, and the cruiser--sole
U||   survivor of Triplanetary's supposedly invincible force--shot away with
U||   every projector delivering its maximum blast.
U||   As the scene of the disaster was approached there was revealed upon the
U||   plates a confused mass of debris; a mass whose individual units were
U||   apparently moving at random: yet which was as a whole still following
U||   the orbit of Roger's planetoid. Space was full of machine parts,
U||   structural members, furniture, flotsam of all kinds; and everywhere
U||   were the bodies of men. Some were encased in space-suits, and it was to
U||   these that the rescuers turned first--space-hardened veterans though
U||   the men of the Chicago were, they did not care even to look at the
U||   others. Strangely enough, however, not one of the floating figures
U||   spoke or moved, and space-line men were hurriedly sent out to
U||   investigate.
U||   "All dead." Quickly the dread report came back. "Been dead a long time.
U||   The armor is all stripped off the suits, and the generators and the
U||   other apparatus are all shot. Something funny about it, too--none of
U||   them seem to have been touched, but the machinery of the suits seems to
U||   be about half of it missing."
U||   "I've got it all on the spools, sir." Cleveland, his close-up survey of
U||   the wreckage finished, turned to the captain. "What they've just
U||   reported checks up with what I've photographed everywhere. I've got an
U||   idea of what might have happened, but it's so dizzy that I'll have to
U||   have a lot of reenforcement before I'll believe it myself. But you
U||   might have them bring in a few of the armored bodies, a couple of those
U||   switchboards and panels floating around out there, and half a dozen
U||   miscellaneous pieces of junk--the nearest things they get hold of,
U||   whatever they happen to be."
U||   "Then back to Tellus at maximum?"
U||   "Right--back to Tellus, as fast as we can possibly go there."
U||   While the Chicago hurtled through space at full power, Cleveland and
U||   the ranking officers of the vessel grouped themselves about the
U||   salvaged wreckage. Familiar with space-wrecks as were they all, none of
U||   them had ever seen anything like the material before them. For every
U||   part and instrument was weirdly and meaninglessly disintegrated. There
U||   were no breaks, no marks of violence, and yet nothing was intact.
U||   Bolt-holes stared empty, cores, shielding cases and needles had
U||   disappeared, the vital parts of every instrument hung awry,
U||   disorganization reigned rampant and supreme.
U||   "I never imagined such a mess," the captain said, after a long and
U||   silent study of the objects. "If you have any theory to cover that,
U||   Cleveland, I would like to hear it!"
U||   "I want you to notice something first," the visiray expert replied.
U||   "But don't look for what's there--look for what isn't there."
U||   "Well, the armor is gone. So are the shielding cases, shafts, spindles,
U||   the housings and stems...." The captain's voice died away as his eyes
U||   raced over the collection. "Why, everything that was made of wood,
U||   bakelite, copper aluminum, silver, bronze, or anything but steel hasn't
U||   been touched, and every bit of steel is gone. But that doesn't make
U||   sense--what does it mean?"
U||   "I don't know--yet," Cleveland replied, slowly. "But I'm afraid that
U||   there's more, and worse." He opened a space-suit reverently, revealing
U||   the face; a face calm and peaceful, but utterly, sickeningly white.
U||   Still reverently, he made a deep incision in the brawny neck, severing
U||   the jugular vein, then went on, soberly:
U||   "You never imagined such a thing as white blood, either, but it all
U||   checks up. Someway, somehow, every particle--probably every atom--of
U||   free or combined iron in this whole volume of space was made off with."
U||   "Huh? How come? And above all, why?" from the amazed and staring
U||   officers.
U||   "You know as much as I do," grimly, ponderingly. "If it were not for
U||   the fact that there are solid asteroids of iron out beyond Mars, I
U||   would say that somebody wanted iron badly enough to wipe out the fleets
U||   and the planetoid to get it. But anyway, whoever they were, they
U||   carried enough power so that our armament didn't bother them at all.
U||   They simply took the metal they wanted and went away with it--so fast
U||   that I couldn't trace them with an ultra-beam. There's only one thing
U||   plain; but that's so plain that it scares me stiff. This whole affair
U||   spells intelligence, with a capital "I", and that intelligence is
U||   anything but friendly. As for me I want to get Fred Rodebush at work on
U||   this soon--think I'll hurry it up a little."
U||   He stepped over to his ultra-projector and called the Terrestrial
U||   headquarters of the T. S. S. Samms' face soon appeared upon his screen.
U||   "We got it all, Virgil," he reported.
U||   "It's something extraordinary--bigger, wider, and deeper than any of us
U||   dreamed. It may be urgent, too, so I think I had better shoot the
U||   pictures in on the ultra-wave and save a few days. Fred has a
U||   telemagneto recorder there that he can synchronize with this camera
U||   outfit easily enough. Right?"
U||   "Right. Good work, Lyman--thanks," came back terse approval and
U||   appreciation, and soon the steel tapes were again flashing between the
U||   feed-rolls. This time, however, their varying magnetic charges were
U||   modulating an ultra-wave so that every detail of that calamitous battle
U||   of the void was being screened and recorded in the innermost private
U||   laboratory of the Triplanetary Secret Service.
U||   Eager though he naturally was to join his fellow-scientists, Cleveland
U||   did not waste his time during the long, but uneventful journey back to
U||   earth. There was much to study, many improvements to be made in his
U||   comparatively crude first ultra-camera. Then, too, there were long
U||   conferences with Samms, and particularly with Rodebush, the
U||   mathematical physicist, whose was the task of solving the riddles of
U||   the energies and weapons of the Nevians. Thus it did not seem long
U||   before green Terra grew large beneath the flying sphere of the Chicago.
U||   "Going to have to circle at once, aren't you?" Cleveland asked the
U||   chief pilot. He had been watching that officer closely for minutes,
U||   admiring the delicacy and precision with which the great vessel was
U||   being maneuvered preliminary to entering the earth's atmosphere.
U||   "Yes," the pilot replied. "We had to come in in the shortest possible
U||   time, and that meant a velocity here that we can't check without a
U||   spiral. However, even at that we saved a lot of time. You can save
U||   quite a bit more, though, by having a rocket-plane come out to meet us
U||   somewhere around fifteen or twenty thousand kilometers, depending upon
U||   where you want to land. With their power-to-mass ratio they can match
U||   our velocity and still make the drop direct."
U||   "Guess I'll do that--thanks," and the operative called his chief, only
U||   to learn that his suggestion had already been acted upon.
U||   "We beat you to it, Lyman," Samms smiled. "The Silver Sliver is out
U||   there now, looping to match your course, acceleration, and velocity at
U||   twenty-two thousand kilometers. You'll be ready to transfer?"
U||   "I'll be ready!" and the Quartermaster's ex-clerk went to his quarters
U||   and packed his dunnage-bag.
U||   In due time the long, slender body of the rocket-plane came into view,
U||   creeping 'down' upon the space-ship from 'above,' and Cleveland bade
U||   his friends good-bye. Donning a space-suit, he stationed himself in the
U||   starboard airlock. Its atmosphere was withdrawn, the outer door opened,
U||   and he glanced across a bare hundred feet of space at the rocket-plane
U||   which, keel ports fiercely aflame, was braking her terrific speed to
U||   match the slower pace of the gigantic ship of war. Shaped like a
U||   toothpick, needle-pointed fore and aft, with ultra-stubby wings and
U||   vanes, with flush-set rocket ports everywhere, built of a lustrous
U||   silvery alloy of noble and almost infusible metals--such was the
U||   private speedboat of the chief of the T. S. S. The fastest thing known,
U||   whether in planetary air, the stratosphere, or the vacuus depth of
U||   interplanetary space, her first flashing trial spins had won her the
U||   nickname of the Silver Sliver. She had had a more formal name, but that
U||   title had long since been buried in the Departmental files.
U||   Lower and slower dropped the Silver Sliver, her rockets flaming even
U||   brighter, until her slender length lay level with the airlock door.
U||   Then her blasting discharges subsided to the power necessary to match
U||   exactly the Chicago's deceleration.
U||   "Ready to cut, Chicago! Give me a three-second call!" snapped from the
U||   pilot room of the Sliver.
U||   "Ready to cut!" the pilot of the Chicago replied. "Seconds! Three! Two!
U||   One! CUT!"
U||   At the last word the power of both vessels was instantly cut off and
U||   everything in them became weightless. In the tiny airlock of the
U||   slender craft crouched a space-line man with coiled cable in readiness,
U||   but he was not needed. As the flaring exhausts ceased Cleveland swung
U||   out his heavy bag and stepped lightly off into space, and in a right
U||   line he floated directly into the open doorway of the rocket-plane. The
U||   door clanged shut behind him and in a matter of moments he stood in the
U||   control room of the racer, divested of his armor and shaking hands with
U||   his friend and co-laborer, Frederick Rodebush.
U||   "Well, Fred, what do you know?" Cleveland asked, as soon as greetings
U||   had been exchanged. "How do the various reports dovetail together? I
U||   know that you couldn't tell me anything on the wave, but there's no
U||   danger of eavesdroppers here."
U||   "You can't tell," Rodebush soberly replied. "We're just beginning to
U||   wake up to the fact that there are a lot of things we don't know
U||   anything about. Better wait until we're back at the Hill. We have a
U||   full set of ultra-screens around there now. There's a couple of other
U||   good reasons, too--it would be better for both of us to go over the
U||   whole thing with Virgil, from the ground up; and we can't do any more
U||   talking, anyway. Our orders are to get back there at maximum, and you
U||   know what that means aboard the Sliver. Strap yourself solid in that
U||   shock-absorber there, and here's a pair of ear-plugs."
U||   "When the Sliver really cuts loose it means a rough party, all right,"
U||   Cleveland assented, snapping about his body the heavy spring-straps of
U||   his deeply cushioned seat, "but I'm just as anxious to get back to the
U||   Hill as anybody can be to get me there. All set."
U||   Rodebush waved his hand at the pilot and the purring whisper of the
U||   exhausts changed instantly to a deafening, continuous explosion. The
U||   men were pressed deeply into their shock-absorbing chairs as the Silver
U||   Sliver spun around her longitudinal axis and darted away from the
U||   Chicago with such a tremendous acceleration that the spherical warship
U||   seemed to be standing still in space. In due time the calculated
U||   mid-point was reached, the slim space-plane rolled over again, and, mad
U||   acceleration now reversed, rushed on toward the earth, but with
U||   constantly diminishing speed. Finally a measurable atmospheric pressure
U||   was encountered, the needle prow dipped downward, and the Silver Sliver
U||   shot forward upon her tiny wings and vanes, nose-rockets now drumming
U||   in staccato thunder. Her metal grew hot: dull red, bright red yellow,
U||   blinding white; but it neither melted nor burned. The pilot's
U||   calculations had been sound, and though the limiting point of safety of
U||   temperature was reached and steadily held, it was not exceeded. As the
U||   density of the air increased so decreased the velocity of the man-made
U||   meteorite. So it was that a dazzling lance of fire sped high over
U||   Seattle, lower over Spokane, and hurled itself eastward, a furiously
U||   flaming arrow; slanting downward in a long, screaming dive toward the
U||   heart of the Rockies. As the now rapidly cooling greyhound of the skies
U||   passed over the western ranges of the Bitter Roots it became apparent
U||   that her goal was a vast, flat-topped, and conical mountain, shrouded
U||   in livid light; a mountain whose height awed even its stupendous
U||   neighbors.
U||   While not artificial, the Hill had been altered markedly by the
U||   Triplanetary engineers who had built into it the headquarters of the
U||   Secret Service. Its mile-wide top was a jointless expanse of gray armor
U||   steel; the steep, smooth surface of the truncated cone was a
U||   continuation of the same immensely thick sheet of metal. No known
U||   vehicle could climb that smooth, hard, forbidding slope of steel; no
U||   known projectile could mar that armor; no known craft could even
U||   approach the Hill without detection. Could not approach it at all, in
U||   fact, for it was constantly inclosed in a vast hemisphere of lambent
U||   violet flame through which neither material substance nor destructive
U||   ray could pass.
U||   As the Silver Sliver, crawling along at a bare three-hundred miles an
U||   hour, approached that transparent, brilliantly violet wall of
U||   destruction, a violet light filled her control room and as suddenly
U||   went out; flashing on and off again and again.
U||   "Giving us the once-over, eh?" Cleveland asked. "That is something new,
U||   isn't it, Fred?"
U||   "Yes, it's a high-powered ultra-wave spy," Rodenbush returned. "The
U||   light is simply a warning, which can be carried if desired. It can also
U||   carry voice and vision...."
U||   "Like this," Samms' voice interrupted from the powerful dynamic speaker
U||   upon the pilots' panel and his clear-cut face appeared upon the
U||   television screen. "I don't suppose Fred thought to mention it, but
U||   this is one of his inventions of the last few days. We are just trying
U||   it out on you. It doesn't mean a thing though, as far as the Sliver is
U||   concerned. Come ahead!"
U||   A circular opening appeared in the wall of force, an opening which
U||   disappeared as soon as the plane had darted through it; and at the same
U||   time her landing-cradle rose into the air through a great trap-door.
U||   Slowly and gracefully the space-plane settled downward into that
U||   cushioned embrace. Then cradle and nestled Sliver sank from view and,
U||   turning smoothly upon mighty trunnions, the plug of armor drove solidly
U||   back into its place in the metal pavement of the mountain's lofty
U||   summit. The cradle-elevator dropped rapidly, coming to rest many levels
U||   down in the heart of the Hill, and Cleveland and Rodebush leaped
U||   lightly out of their transport, through her still hot outer walls. A
U||   door opened before them and they found themselves in a large room of
U||   full daylight illumination; the anteroom of the private office of
U||   Virgil Samms. Chiefs of Departments sat at their desks, concentrated
U||   upon problems or at ease, according to the demands of the moment;
U||   televisotypes and recorders flashed busily but silently; calmly
U||   efficient men and women went wontedly about the all-embracing business
U||   of Triplanetary's space-pervading Secret Service.
U||   "Right of way, Norma?" Rodebush paused briefly before the desk of the
U||   Chief's private secretary; but even before he had spoken she had
U||   pressed a button and the door behind her swung wide.
U||   "You two do not need to be announced," the attractive young woman
U||   smiled. "Go right in."
U||   Samms met them at the door eagerly, shaking hands particularly
U||   vigorously with Cleveland.
U||   "Congratulations on that camera, Lyman!" he exclaimed. "You did a
U||   wonderful piece of work on that. Help yourselves to smokes and sit
U||   down--there are a lot of things we want to talk over. Your pictures
U||   carried most of the story, but they would have left us pretty much at
U||   sea without Costigan's reports. But as it was, Fred here and his crew
U||   worked out most of the answers from the dope the two of you got; and
U||   what few they haven't got yet they soon will have."
U||   "Nothing new on Conway?" Cleveland was almost afraid to ask the
U||   question.
U||   "No." A shadow came over Samms' face. "I'm afraid ... but I'm hoping
U||   it's only that those creatures, whatever they are, have taken him so
U||   far away that he can't reach us."
U||   "They certainly are so far away that we can't reach them." Rodenbush
U||   volunteered. "We can't even get their ultra-wave interference any
U||   more."
U||   "Yes, that's a hopeful sign," Samms went on. "I hate to think of Conway
U||   Costigan checking out. There, fellows, was a real observer. He was the
U||   only man, I have ever known, who combined the two qualities of the
U||   perfect witness. He could actually see everything he looked at, and
U||   could report it truly, to the last, least detail. Take all this stuff,
U||   for instance; especially their ability to transform iron into a fluid
U||   allotrope, and in that form to use its intra-atomic energy as power.
U||   Something brand new--unheard of except in the ravings of imaginative
U||   fiction--and yet he described their converters and projectors so
U||   minutely that Fred was able to work out the underlying theory in three
U||   days, and to tie it in with our own super-ship. My first thought was
U||   that we'd have to rebuild it iron-free, but Fred showed me my
U||   error--you found it first yourself, of course."
U||   "It wouldn't do any good to make the ship non-ferrous unless you could
U||   so change our blood chemistry that we could get along without
U||   hemoglobin, and that would be quite a feat," Cleveland agreed. "Then,
U||   too, our most vital electrical machinery is built around iron cores.
U||   No, we'll have to develop a screen for those forces--screens, rather,
U||   so powerful that they can't drive anything through them."
U||   "We've been working along those lines ever since you reported,"
U||   Rodebush said, "and we're beginning to see light. And in that same
U||   connection it's no wonder that we couldn't handle our super-ship. We
U||   had some good ideas, but they were wrongly applied. However, things
U||   look quite promising now. We have that transformation of iron all
U||   worked out in theory, and as soon as we get a generator going we can
U||   straighten out everything else in short order. And think what that
U||   unlimited power means! All the power we want--power enough even to try
U||   out such hitherto purely theoretical possibilities as the
U||   neutralization of gravity, and even of the inertia of matter!"
U||   "Hold on!" protested Samms. "You certainly can't do that! Inertia
U||   is--must be--a basic attribute of matter, and surely cannot be done
U||   away with without destroying the matter itself. Don't start anything
U||   like that. Fred--I don't want to lose you and Lyman, too."
U||   "Don't worry about us, Chief." Rodebush replied with a smile. "If you
U||   will tell me what matter is, fundamentally, I may agree with you....
U||   No? Well, then, don't be surprised at anything that happens. We are
U||   going to do a lot of things that nobody ever thought of doing before."
U||   Thus for a long time the argument and discussion went on, to be
U||   interrupted by the voice of the secretary.
U||   "Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Samms, but some things have come up that you
U||   will have to handle. Knobos is calling from out near Mars. He has
U||   caught the Endymion, and has killed about half her crew doing it.
U||   Milton has finally reported from Venus, after being out of touch for
U||   five days. He trailed the Wintons into Thalleron swamp. They crashed
U||   him there, but he won out and has what he went after. And just now I
U||   got a flash from Fletcher, in the asteroid belt. I think that he has
U||   finally traced that dope line. But Knobos is on now--what do you want
U||   him to do about the Endymion?"
U||   "Tell him to--no, put him on here, I'd better tell him myself," Samms
U||   directed, and his face hardened in ruthless decision as the horny,
U||   misshapen face of the Martian lieutenant appeared upon the screen.
U||   "What do you think, Knobos? Shall they come to trial or not?"
U||   "No."
U||   "I don't think so, either. It is better that a few gangsters should
U||   disappear in space than run the risk of another uprising. See to it."
U||   "Right." The screen darkened and Samms spoke to his secretary. "Put
U||   Milton and Fletcher on whenever their rays come in." He then turned to
U||   his guests. "We've covered the ground quite thoroughly. Good-bye--I
U||   wish I could go with you, but I'll be pretty well tied up for the next
U||   week or two."
U||   "Tied up, doesn't half express it," Rodebush remarked as the two
U||   scientists walked along a corridor toward an elevator. "He probably is
U||   the busiest man on the three planets."
U||   "As well as the most powerful," Cleveland supplemented. "And very few
U||   men could use his power as fairly--but he's welcome to it, as far as
U||   I'm concerned. I'd have the pink fantods for a month if I had to do
U||   only once what he's just done--and to him it's just part of a day's
U||   work."
U||   "You mean the Endymion? What else could he do?"
U||   "Nothing--that's just what I'm talking about. It had to be done, since
U||   bringing them to trial would probably mean killing half the people of
U||   Morseca; but at the same time it's a ghastly thing to have to order a
U||   job of deliberate, cold-blooded, and illegal murder."
U||   "You're right, of course, but you would...." he broke off, unable to
U||   put his thoughts into words. For while inarticulate, manlike,
U||   concerning their deepest emotions, in both men was ingrained the code
U||   of their organization; both knew that to every man chosen for it The
U||   Service was everything, himself nothing.
U||   "But enough of that, we'll have plenty of grief of our own right here,"
U||   Rodebush changed the subject abruptly as they stepped into a vast room,
U||   almost filled by the immense bulk of the Boise--the sinister space-ship
U||   which, although never flown, had already lined with black so many pages
U||   of Triplanetary's roster. She was now, however, the center of a furious
U||   activity. Men swarmed over her and through her, in the orderly
U||   confusion of a fiercely driven but carefully planned program of
U||   reconstruction.
U||   "I hope your dope is right, Fred!" Cleveland called, as the two
U||   scientists separated to go to their respective laboratories. "If it is,
U||   we'll make a perfect lady out of this unmanageable man-killer yet!"
U||CHAPTER VIII
U||  The Super-Ship Is Launched
U||   After weeks of ceaseless work, during which was lavished upon her every
U||   resource of mind and material afforded by three planets, the Boise was
U||   ready for her maiden flight. As nearly ready, that is, as the thought
U||   and labor of man could make her. Rodebush and Cleveland had finished
U||   their last rigid inspection of the craft and, standing beside the
U||   center door of the main airlock, were talking with their chief.
U||   "You say that you think that it's safe, and yet you won't take a crew,"
U||   Samms argued. "In that case it isn't safe enough for you men, either.
U||   We need you too badly to permit you to take such chances."
U||   "You've got to let us go; because we are the only ones who are
U||   thoroughly familiar with her theory," Rodebush insisted. "I said, and
U||   still say, that I think it is safe. I can't prove it, however, except
U||   mathematically; because she's altogether too full of too many new and
U||   untried mechanisms, too many extrapolations beyond all existing or
U||   possible data. Theoretically, she is sound, but you know that theory
U||   can go only so far, and that mathematically negligible factors may
U||   become operative at those velocities. We do not need a crew for a short
U||   trip. We can take care of any minor mishaps, and if our fundamental
U||   theories are wrong, all the crews between here and Jupiter wouldn't do
U||   any good. Therefore we two are going--alone."
U||   "Well, be very careful, anyway. Start out slow and take it easy."
U||   "Start out slow? We can't! We can't neutralize half of gravity, nor
U||   half of the inertia of matter--it's got to be everything or nothing, as
U||   soon as the neutralizers go on. We could start out on the projectors,
U||   of course, instead of on the neutralizers, but that wouldn't prove
U||   anything and would only prolong the agony."
U||   "Well, then, be as careful as you can."
U||   "We'll do that, Chief," Cleveland put in. "We think a lot of us, and we
U||   aren't committing suicide just yet if we can help it. And remember
U||   about everybody staying inside when we take off--it's barely possible
U||   that we'll take up a lot of room. Good-bye to all of you."
U||   "Good-bye, fellows!"
U||   The massive insulating doors were shut, the metal side of the mountain
U||   opened, and huge, squat caterpillar tractors came roaring and clanking
U||   into the room. Chains and cables were made fast and, mighty steel rails
U||   groaning under the load, the space-ship upon her rolling ways was
U||   dragged out of the Hill and far out upon the level floor of the surface
U||   before the tractors cast off and returned to the fortress.
U||   "Everybody is under cover." Samms informed Rodebush. The chief was
U||   staring intently into his plate, upon which was revealed the control
U||   room of the untried super-ship. He heard Rodebush speak to Cleveland;
U||   heard the observer's brief reply; saw the navigator throw his
U||   switches--then the communicator plate went blank. Not the ordinary
U||   blankness of a cut-off, but a peculiarly disquieting fading out into
U||   darkness. And where the great space-ship had rested there was for an
U||   instant nothing. Exactly nothing--a vacuum. Vessel, falsework, rollers,
U||   trucks, the enormous steel I-beams of the tracks, even the deep-set
U||   concrete piers and foundations and a vast hemisphere of the solid
U||   ground; all had disappeared utterly and instantaneously. But almost as
U||   suddenly as it had been formed the vacuum was filled by a cyclonic rush
U||   of air. There was a detonation as of a hundred vicious thunderclaps
U||   made one, and, through the howling, shrieking blasts of wind, there
U||   rained down upon the valley, plain and metaled mountain a veritable
U||   avalanche of debris: bent, twisted, and broken rails and beams,
U||   splintered timbers, masses of concrete, and thousands of cubic yards of
U||   soil and rock. For inertia and gravitation had not been neutralized at
U||   precisely the same instant, and for a moment everything within the
U||   radius of action of the iron-driven gravity nullifiers of the Boise had
U||   continued its absolute motion with inertia unimpaired. Then, left
U||   behind immediately by the almost infinite velocity of the cruiser, all
U||   this material had again become subject to all of Nature's everyday laws
U||   and had crashed back to the ground.
U||   "Could you hold your beam, Randolph?" Samm's voice cut sharply through
U||   the daze of stupefaction which held spellbound most of the denizens of
U||   the Hill. But all were not so held--no conceivable emergency could take
U||   the attention of the chief ultra-wave operator from his instruments.
U||   "No, sir," Radio Center shot back. "It faded out and I couldn't recover
U||   it. I put everything I've got behind a tracer on that beam, but haven't
U||   been able to lift a single needle off the pin."
U||   "And no wreckage of the vessel itself," Samms went on, half audibly.
U||   "Either they have succeeded far beyond their wildest hopes or else ...
U||   more probably...." He fell silent and switched off the plate. Were his
U||   two friends, those intrepid scientists, alive and triumphant, or had
U||   they gone to lengthen the list of victims of that man-killing
U||   space-ship? Reason told him that they were gone. They must be gone, or
U||   else his ultra-beams--energies of such unthinkable velocity of
U||   propagation that man's most sensitive instruments had never been able
U||   even to estimate it--would have held the ship's transmitter in spite of
U||   any velocity attainable by any matter under any conceivable conditions.
U||   The ship must have been disintegrated as soon as Rodebush released his
U||   forces. And yet, had not the physicist dimly foreseen the possibility
U||   of such an actual velocity--or had he? However, individuals could came
U||   and could go, but Triplanetary went on. Samms squared his shoulders
U||   unconsciously, and slowly, grimly, made his way back to his private
U||   office.
U||   He had scant time to mourn. Scarcely had he seated himself at his desk
U||   when an emergency call came snapping in; a call of such import that his
U||   secretary's usually calm voice trembled as she put it on his plate.
U||   "Commissioner Hinkle is calling, sir," she announced. "Something
U||   terrible is going on again, out toward Orion. Here he is," and there
U||   appeared upon the screen the face of the Commissioner of Public Safety,
U||   the commander of Triplanetary's every armed force--whether of land or
U||   of water, of air or of empty space.
U||   "They've come back, Samms!" the Commissioner rapped out, without
U||   preliminary or greeting. "Four vessels gone--a freighter and a
U||   passenger liner, with her escort of two heavy cruisers. All in Sector
U||   M; Dx about 151. I have ordered all traffic out of space for the
U||   duration of the emergency, and since even our warships seem useless,
U||   every ship is making for the nearest dock at maximum. How about that
U||   new flyer of yours--got anything that will do us any good?" No one
U||   beyond the "Hill's" shielding screens knew that the Boise had already
U||   been launched.
U||   "I don't know. We don't even know whether we have a super-ship or not,"
U||   and Samms described briefly the beginning--and very probably the
U||   ending--of the trial flight, concluding: "It looks bad, but if there
U||   was any possible way of handling her, Rodebush and Cleveland did it.
U||   All our tracers are negative yet, so nothing definite has...."
U||   He broke off as a frantic call came in from the Pittsburgh station for
U||   the Commissioner, a call which Samms both heard and saw.
U||   "The city is being attacked!" came the urgent message. "We need all the
U||   reinforcements you can send us!" and a picture of the beleaguered city
U||   appeared in ghastly detail upon the screens of the observers; a view
U||   being recorded from the air. It required only seconds for the
U||   commissioner to order every available man and engine of war to the seat
U||   of conflict; then, having done everything they could, Hinkle and Samms
U||   stared in helpless, fascinated horror into their plates, watching the
U||   scenes of carnage and destruction depicted there.
U||   The Nevian vessel--the sister-ship, the craft which Costigan had seen
U||   in mid-space as it hurtled earthward in response to Nerado's
U||   summons--hung poised in full visibility, high above the metropolis.
U||   Scornful of the pitiful weapons wielded by man she hung there, her
U||   sinister beauty of line sharply defined against the cloudless sky. From
U||   her shining hull there reached down a tenuous but rigid rod of crimson
U||   energy; a rod which slowly swept hither and thither as the detectors of
U||   the amphibians searched out the richest deposits of the precious iron
U||   for which the inhuman visitors had come so far. Iron, once solid, now a
U||   viscous red liquid, was sluggishly flowing in an ever-thickening stream
U||   up that intangible crimson duct and into the capacious storage tanks of
U||   the Nevian raider; and wherever that flaming beam went there went also
U||   ruin, destruction, and death. Office buildings, skyscrapers towering
U||   majestically in their architectural symmetry and beauty, collapsed into
U||   heaps of debris as their steel skeletons were abstracted. Deep into the
U||   ground the beam bored; flood, fire, and explosion following in its wake
U||   as the mazes of underground piping disappeared. And the humanity of the
U||   buildings died: instantaneously and painlessly, never knowing what
U||   struck them, as the life-bearing iron of their bodies went to swell the
U||   Nevian stream.
U||   Pittsburgh's defenses had been feeble indeed. A few antiquated railway
U||   rifles had hurled their shells upward in futile defiance, and had been
U||   quietly absorbed. The district planes of Triplanetary, newly armed with
U||   iron-driven ultra-beams, had assembled hurriedly and had attacked the
U||   invader in formation, with but little more success. Under the impact of
U||   their beams the stranger's screens had flared white, then poised ship
U||   and flying squadron alike had been lost to view in a murkily opaque
U||   shroud of crimson flame. The cloud had soon dissolved, and from the
U||   place where the planes had been there had floated or crashed down a
U||   litter of non-ferrous wreckage. And now the cone of space-ships from
U||   the Buffalo base of Triplanetary was approaching Pittsburgh, hurling
U||   itself toward the Nevian plunderer and toward known, gruesome and
U||   hopeless defeat.
U||   "Stop them, Hinkle!" Samms cried. "It's sheer slaughter! They haven't
U||   got a thing--they aren't even equipped yet with the iron drive!"
U||   "I know it," the commissioner groaned, "and Admiral Barnes knows it as
U||   well as we do, but it can't be helped--wait a minute! The Washington
U||   cone is reporting. They're as close as the other, and they have the new
U||   armament. Philadelphia is close behind, and so is New York. Now perhaps
U||   we can do something!"
U||   The Buffalo flotilla slowed and stopped, and in a matter of minutes the
U||   detachments from the other bases arrived. The cone was formed and
U||   iron-driven vessels in the van, the old-type craft far in the rear, it
U||   bore down upon the Nevian, vomiting from its hollow front a solid
U||   cylinder of annihilation. Once more the screens of the Nevian flared
U||   into brilliance, once more the red cloud of destruction was flung
U||   abroad. But these vessels were not entirely defenseless. Their
U||   iron-driven ultra-generators threw out screens of the Nevians' own
U||   formulae, screens of prodigious power to which the energies of the
U||   amphibians clung and at which they clawed and tore in baffled, wildly
U||   coruscant displays of power unthinkable. For minutes the furious
U||   conflict raged, while the inconceivable energy being dissipated by
U||   those straining screens hurled itself in terribly destructive bolts of
U||   lightning upon the city far beneath.
U||   No battle of such incredible violence could long endure. Triplanetary's
U||   ships were already exerting their utmost power, while the Nevians,
U||   contemptuous of Solarian science, had not yet uncovered their full
U||   strength. Thus the last desperate effort of mankind was proved futile
U||   as the invaders forced their beams deeper and deeper into the
U||   overloaded, defensive screens of the war-vessels; and one by one the
U||   supposedly invincible space-ships of humanity dropped in horribly
U||   dismembered wreckage upon the ruins of what had once been Pittsburgh.
U||CHAPTER IX
U||  Specimens
U||   Only too well founded was Costigan's conviction that the submarine of
U||   the deep-sea fishes had not been able to prevail against Nerado's
U||   formidable engines of destruction. For days the Nevian lifeboat with
U||   its three Terrestrial passengers hurtled through the interstellar void
U||   without incident, but finally the operative's fears were realized--his
U||   far-flung detector screens reacted; upon his observation plate lay
U||   revealed Nerado's mammoth space-ship, in full pursuit of its fleeing
U||   lifeboat!
U||   "On your toes, folks--it won't be long now!" Costigan called, and
U||   Bradley and Clio hurried into the tiny control room.
U||   Armor donned and tested, the three Terrestrials stared into the
U||   observation plates, watching the rapidly enlarging pictures of the
U||   Nevian space-ship. Nerado had traced them and was following them, and
U||   such was the power of the great vessel that the nearly inconceivable
U||   velocity of the lifeboat was the veriest crawl in comparison to that of
U||   the pursuing cruiser.
U||   "And we've hardly started to cover the distance back to Tellus. Of
U||   course you couldn't get in touch with anybody yet?" Bradley stated,
U||   rather than asked.
U||   "I kept on trying until they blanketed my wave, but all negative.
U||   Thousands of times too far for my transmitter. Our only hope of
U||   reaching anybody was the mighty slim chance that our super-ship might
U||   be prowling around out here already, but it isn't, of course. Here they
U||   are!"
U||   Reaching out to the control panel, Costigan shot out against the great
U||   vessel wave after wave of lethal vibrations, under whose fiercely
U||   clinging impacts the Nevian defensive screens flared white; but,
U||   strangely enough, their own screens did not radiate. As if contemptuous
U||   of any weapons the lifeboat might wield, the mother ship simply
U||   defended herself from the attacking beams, in much the same fashion as
U||   a wildcat mother wards off the claws and teeth of her spitting,
U||   snarling kitten who is resenting a touch of needed maternal discipline.
U||   "They probably won't fight us, at that," Clio first understood the
U||   situation. "This is their own lifeboat, and they want us alive, you
U||   know."
U||   "There's one more thing we can try--hang on!" Costigan snapped, as he
U||   released his screens and threw all his power into one enormous pressor
U||   beam.
U||   The three were thrown to the floor and held there by an awful weight,
U||   as if the lifeboat darted away at the stupendous acceleration of the
U||   beam's reaction against the unimaginable mass of the Nevian sky-rover;
U||   but the flight was of short duration. Along that pressor beam there
U||   crept a dull rod of energy, which surrounded the fugitive shell and
U||   brought it slowly to a halt. Furiously then Costigan set and reset his
U||   controls, launching his every driving force and his every weapon, but
U||   no beam could penetrate that red murk, and the lifeboat remained
U||   motionless in space. No, not motionless--the red rod was shortening,
U||   drawing the truant craft back toward the launching port from which she
U||   had so hopefully emerged a few days before. Back and back it was drawn;
U||   Costigan's utmost efforts futile to affect by a hair's breadth its line
U||   of motion. Through the open port the boat slipped neatly, and as it
U||   came to a halt in its original position within the multilayered skin of
U||   the monster, the prisoners heard the heavy doors clang shut behind
U||   them, one after another.
U||   And then sheets of blue fire snapped and crackled all about the three
U||   suits of Triplanetary armor--the two large human figures and the small
U||   one were outlined starkly in blinding blue flame.
U||   "That's the first thing that has come off according to schedule."
U||   Costigan laughed, a short, fierce bark. "That is their paralyzing ray;
U||   we've got it stopped cold, and we've each got enough iron to hold it
U||   forever."
U||   "But it looks as though the best we can do is to stalemate," Bradley
U||   argued. "Even if they can't paralyze us, we can't hurt them, and we are
U||   heading back for Nevia."
U||   "I think Nerado will come in for a conference, and we'll be able to
U||   make terms of some kind. He must know what these Lewistons will do, and
U||   he knows that we'll get a chance to use them, some way or other, before
U||   he gets to us again," Costigan asserted confidently--but again he was
U||   wrong.
U||   The door opened, and through it there waddled, rolled, or crawled a
U||   metal-clad monstrosity--a thing with wheels, legs, and writhing
U||   tentacles of jointed bronze; a thing possessed of defensive screens
U||   sufficiently powerful to absorb the full blast of the Triplanetary
U||   projectors without effort. Three brazen tentacles reached out through
U||   the ravening beams of the Lewistons, smashed them to bits, and wrapped
U||   themselves in unbreakable shackles about the armored forms of the three
U||   human beings. Through the door the machine or creature carried its
U||   helpless load, and out into and along a main corridor. And soon the
U||   three Terrestrials, without armor, without arms, and almost without
U||   clothing, were standing in the control room, again facing the calm and
U||   unmoved Nerado. To the surprise of the impetuous Costigan, the Nevian
U||   commander was entirely without rancor.
U||   "The desire for freedom is perhaps common to all forms of animate
U||   life," he commented, through the transformer. "As I told you before,
U||   however, you are specimens to be studied by the College of Science, and
U||   you shall be so studied in spite of anything you may do. Resign
U||   yourselves to that."
U||   "Well, say that we don't try to make any more trouble; that we
U||   co-operate in the examination and give you whatever information we
U||   can," Costigan suggested. "Then you will probably be willing to give us
U||   a ship and let us go back to our own world?"
U||   "You will not be allowed to cause any more trouble," the amphibian
U||   declared, coldly. "Your co-operation will not be required. We will take
U||   from you whatever knowledge and information we wish. In all probability
U||   you will never be allowed to return to your own system, because as
U||   specimens you are too unique to lose. But enough of this idle
U||   chatter--take them back to their quarters!"
U||   And back to their inter-communicating rooms the prisoners were led
U||   under heavy guard.
U||   True to his word, Nerado made certain that they had no more
U||   opportunities to escape. All the way back to far-distant Nevia the
U||   space-ship sped, where at once, in manacles, the Terrestrials were
U||   taken to the College of Science, there to undergo the physical and
U||   psychical examinations which Nerado had promised them.
U||   Clio and Costigan learned that the Nevian scientist-captain had not
U||   erred in stating that their co-operation was neither needed nor
U||   desired. Furious but impotent, the human beings were studied in
U||   laboratory after laboratory by the coldly analytical, unfeeling
U||   scientists of Nevia, to whom they were nothing more nor less than
U||   specimens; and in full measure they came to know what it meant to play
U||   the part of an unknown, lowly organism in a biological research. They
U||   were photographed, externally and internally. Every bone, muscle,
U||   organ, vessel, and nerve was studied and charted. Every reflex and
U||   reaction was noted and discussed. Meters registered every impulse and
U||   recorders filmed every thought, every idea, and every sensation.
U||   Endlessly, day after day, the nerve-wracking torture went on, until the
U||   frantic subjects could bear no more. White-faced and shaking, Clio
U||   finally screamed wildly, hysterically, as she was being strapped down
U||   upon a laboratory bench; and at the sound Costigan's nerves, already at
U||   the breaking point, gave way in an outburst of Berserk fury.
U||   The man's struggles and the girl's shrieks were alike futile, but the
U||   surprised Nevians, after a consultation, decided to give the specimens
U||   a vacation. To that end they were installed, together with their
U||   earthly belongings, in a three-roomed structure of transparent metal,
U||   floating in the large central lagoon of the city. There they were left
U||   undisturbed for a time--undisturbed, that is, except by the continuous
U||   gaze of the crowd of hundreds of amphibians which constantly surrounded
U||   the floating cottage.
U||   "First we're bugs under a microscope," Bradley growled, "then we're
U||   goldfish in a bowl. I don't know that...."
U||   He broke off as two of their jailers entered the room. Without a word
U||   into the transformers, they seized Bradley and the girl. As those
U||   tentacular arms stretched out toward Clio, Costigan leaped. A vain
U||   attempt. In midair the paralyzing ray of the Nevians touched him and he
U||   crashed heavily to the crystal floor; and from that floor he looked on
U||   in helpless, raging fury while his sweetheart and his captain were
U||   carried out of their prison and into a waiting submarine.
U||CHAPTER X
U||  The Boise Acts
U||   But what of the super-ship? What happened after that inertialess, that
U||   terribly destructive take-off?
U||   Doctor Frederick Rodebush sat at the control panel of Triplanetary's
U||   newly reconstructed space-ship, his hands grasping the gleaming,
U||   ebonite handles of two double-throw switches. Facing the unknown though
U||   the physicist was, yet he grinned whimsically at his friend.
U||   "Something, whatever it is, is about to take place. The Boise is taking
U||   off, under full neutralization. Ready for anything to happen, Cleve?"
U||   "All ready--shoot!" Laconically. Cleveland also was constitutionally
U||   unable to voice his deeper sentiments in time of stress.
U||   Rodebush flipped the switches clear over in flashing arcs, and
U||   instantly over both men there came a sensation akin to a tremendously
U||   intensified vertigo; but a vertigo as far beyond the space-sickness of
U||   weightlessness, as that horrible sensation is beyond mere terrestrial
U||   dizziness. The pilot tried to reverse the switches he had just thrown,
U||   but his leaden hands utterly refused to obey the dictates of his
U||   reeling mind. His brain was a writhing, convulsive mass of torment
U||   indescribable; expanding, exploding, swelling out with an unendurable
U||   pressure against its confining skull. Fiery spirals, laced with
U||   streaming, darting lances of black and green, flamed inside his
U||   bursting eyeballs. The Universe spun and whirled in mad gyrations about
U||   him as he reeled drunkenly to his feet, staggering and sprawling. He
U||   fell. He realized that he was falling, yet he could not fall! Thrashing
U||   wildly, grotesquely in agony, he struggled madly and blindly across the
U||   room, directly toward the thick steel wall. The tip of one hair of his
U||   unruly thatch touched the wall, and the slim length of that single hair
U||   did not even bend as its slight strength brought to an instant halt the
U||   hundred-and-eighty-odd pounds of mass--mass now entirely without
U||   inertia--that was his body.
U||   But finally the sheer brain power of the man began to triumph over his
U||   physical torture. By indomitable force of will he compelled his groping
U||   hands to seize a life-line, almost meaningless to his dazed
U||   intelligence; and through that nightmare incarnate of hellish torture
U||   he fought his way back to the control board. Hooking one leg around a
U||   standard, he made a seemingly enormous effort and drove the two
U||   switches back into their original positions; then fell flat upon the
U||   floor, weakly but in a wave of relief and thankfulness, as his racked
U||   body felt again the wonted phenomena of weight and of inertia. White,
U||   trembling, frankly and openly sick, the two men stared at each other in
U||   half-amazed joy.
U||   "It worked." Cleveland smiled wanly as he recovered sufficiently to
U||   speak, then leaped to his feet. "Snap it up, Fred! We must be falling
U||   fast--we'll be wrecked when we hit!"
U||   "We're not falling anywhere." Rodebush, foreboding in his eyes, walked
U||   over to the main observation plate and scanned the heavens. "However,
U||   it's not as bad as I was afraid it might be. I can still recognize a
U||   few of the constellations, even though they are all pretty badly
U||   distorted. That means that we can't be more than a couple of
U||   light-years or so away from the Solar System. Of course, since we had
U||   so little thrust on, practically all of our time and energy was spent
U||   in getting out of the atmosphere; but, even at that, it's a good thing
U||   that space isn't an absolutely perfect vacuum or we would have been
U||   clear out of the Universe by this time."
U||   "Huh? Impossible--where are we anyway? Then we must be making mil ...
U||   Oh, I see!" Cleveland exclaimed in disjointed sentences as he also
U||   stared into the plate.
U||   "Right. We aren't traveling at all now." Rodebush replied. "We are
U||   perfectly stationary relative to Tellus, since we made the hop without
U||   inertia. We must have attained one hundred percent neutralization,
U||   which we didn't quite expect, and therefore we must have stopped
U||   instantaneously when our inertia was restored. But it isn't where we
U||   are that is worrying me the most--we can fix our place in space
U||   accurately enough by a few observations--it's when."
U||   "That's right, too. Say we're two light-years away. You think maybe
U||   we're two years older than we were ten minutes ago, then? That's
U||   possible, of course, maybe probable: there's been a lot of discussion
U||   on that theory. Now's a good time to prove or to disprove it. Let's
U||   snap back to Tellus and find out."
U||   "We'll do that, after a little more experimenting. You see, I had no
U||   intention of giving us such a long push. I was going to throw the
U||   switches over and back, but you know what happened. However, there's
U||   one good thing about it--it's worth two years of anybody's life to
U||   settle that relativity-time thing definitely, one way or the other."
U||   "I'll say it is. But say, we've got a lot of power on our ultra-wave:
U||   enough to reach Tellus, I think. Let's locate the sun and get in touch
U||   with Samms."
U||   "Let's work on these controls a little first, so we'll have something
U||   to report. Out here's a fine place to try the ship out--nothing in the
U||   way."
U||   "All right with me. But I would like to find out whether I'm two years
U||   older than I think I am, or not!"
U||   Then for hours they put the great super-ship through her paces, just as
U||   test-pilots check up on every detail of performance of an airplane of
U||   new and radical design. They found that the horrible vertigo could be
U||   endured, perhaps in time even conquered as space-sickness could be
U||   conquered, by a strong will in a sound body; and that their new
U||   conveyance had possibilities of which even Rodebush had never dreamed.
U||   Finally, their most pressing questions answered, they turned their most
U||   powerful ultra-beam communicator toward the yellowish star which they
U||   knew to be Old Sol.
U||   "Samms ... Samms." Cleveland spoke slowly and distinctly. "Rodebush and
U||   Cleveland reporting from the 'Space-Eating Wampus', now directly in
U||   line with Beta Ursae Minoris from the sun, distance about two point two
U||   light years. It will take six banks of tubes on your tightest beam,
U||   LSV3, to reach us. Barring a touch of an unusually severe type of
U||   space-sickness, everything worked beautifully; even better than our
U||   calculations showed. There's something we want to know right away--have
U||   we been gone four hours and some odd minutes, or better than two
U||   years?"
U||   He shut off the power, turned to Rodebush, and went on:
U||   "Nobody knows how fast this ultra-wave travels, but if it goes as fast
U||   as we did coming out it's certainly moving. I'll give him about thirty
U||   minutes, then shoot in another call."
U||   But in less than two minutes the care-ravaged face of their chief
U||   appeared sharp and clear upon their plates and his voice snapped curtly
U||   from the speaker.
U||   "Thank God you're alive, and twice that the ship works!" he exclaimed.
U||   "You've been gone four hours, eleven minutes, and forty-one seconds,
U||   but never mind about abstract theorizing. Get back here, to Pittsburgh,
U||   as fast as you can drive. That Nevian vessel or another like her is
U||   mopping up the city, and has destroyed half the Fleet already!"
U||   "We'll be back there in nine minutes!" Rodebush snapped into the
U||   transmitter. "Two to get from here to atmosphere, four from atmosphere
U||   down to the Hill, and three to cool off. Notify the full four-shift
U||   crew--everybody we've picked out. Don't need anybody else. Ship,
U||   batteries, and armament are ready!"
U||   "Two minutes to atmosphere, and it took ten coming out? Think you can
U||   do it?" Cleveland asked, as Rodebush flipped off the power and leaped
U||   to the control panel.
U||   "We could do it in a few seconds if we had to. We used scarcely any
U||   power at all coming out, and I'm not using very much going back," the
U||   physicist explained rapidly, as he set the dials which would determine
U||   their flashing course.
U||   The master switches were thrown and the pangs of inertialessness again
U||   assailed them--but weaker far this time than ever before--and upon
U||   their lookout plates they beheld a spectacle never before seen by eye
U||   of man. For the ultra-beam, with its heterodyned vision, is not
U||   distorted by any velocity yet attained, as are the ether-borne rays of
U||   light. Converted into light only at the plate, it showed their progress
U||   as truly as though they had been traveling at a pace to be expressed in
U||   the ordinary terms of miles per hour. The yellow star that was the sun
U||   detached itself from the firmament and leaped toward them, swelling
U||   visibly, momentarily, into a blinding monster of incandescence. And
U||   toward them also flung the earth, enlarging with such indescribable
U||   rapidity that Cleveland protested involuntarily, in spite of his
U||   knowledge of the peculiar mechanism of the vessel in which they were.
U||   "Hold it, Fred, hold it! Way 'nuff!" he exclaimed.
U||   "I'm using only ten thousand dynes, so she'll stop herself as soon as
U||   we touch atmosphere, long before she can even begin to heat," Rodebush
U||   explained. "Looks bad, but we'll stop without a jar."
U||   And they did. Weightless and without inertia, gravitation powerless
U||   against her neutralizing generators, the great super-ship came from her
U||   practically infinite velocity to an almost instantaneous halt in the
U||   outermost, most tenuous layer of the earth's atmosphere. Her halt was
U||   but momentary. Inertia restored and gravitation allowed again to affect
U||   her mass, she dropped at a sharp angle downward. More than dropped; she
U||   was forced downward by one full battery of projectors; projectors
U||   driven by iron-powered generators. Soon they were over the Hill, whose
U||   violet screens went down at a word.
U||   Flaming a dazzling white from the friction of the atmosphere through
U||   which she had torn her way, the Boise slowed abruptly as she neared the
U||   ground, plunging toward the surface of the small but deep artificial
U||   lake below the Hill's steel apron. Into the cold waters the space-ship
U||   dove, and even before they could close over her, furious geysers of
U||   steam and boiling water erupted as the stubborn alloy gave up its heat
U||   to the cooling liquid. Endlessly the three necessary minutes dragged
U||   their slow way into time, but finally the water ceased boiling and
U||   Rodebush tore the ship from the lake and hurled her into the gaping
U||   doorway of her dock. The massive doors of the air-locks opened, and
U||   while the full crew of picked men hurried aboard with their personal
U||   equipment, Samms talked earnestly to the two scientists in the control
U||   room.
U||   " ... and about half the fleet is still in the air. They aren't
U||   attacking; they are just trying to keep her from doing much more damage
U||   until you can get there. How about your take-off? We can't launch you
U||   again--the tracks are gone--but you handled her easily enough coming
U||   in?"
U||   "That was all my fault," Rodebush admitted. "I should have neutralized
U||   inertia first, but I had no idea that the fields would extend beyond
U||   the hull, nor that they wouldn't act simultaneously. We'll take her out
U||   on the projectors this time, though, the same as we brought her in--she
U||   handles like a bicycle. The projector blast tears things up a little,
U||   but nothing serious. Have you got that Pittsburgh beam for me yet?
U||   We're about ready to go."
U||   "Here it is, Doctor Rodebush," came the secretary's voice, and upon the
U||   screen there flashed into being the view of the events transpiring
U||   above that doomed city. "The dock is empty and sealed against your
U||   blast," and thereupon "Good-bye, and power to your tubes!" came Samms'
U||   ringing voice.
U||   As the words were being spoken, mighty blasts of power raved from the
U||   driving projectors and the immense mass of the super-ship shot out
U||   through the portals and upward into the stratosphere. Through the
U||   tenuous atmosphere the huge ship rushed with ever-mounting speed, and
U||   while the hope of Triplanetary drove eastward Rodebush studied the
U||   ever-changing scene of battle upon his plate and issued detailed
U||   instructions to the highly trained specialists manning every offensive
U||   and defensive weapon.
U||   But the Nevians did not wait to join battle until the newcomers
U||   arrived. Their detectors were sensitive--operative over untold
U||   thousands of miles--and the ultra-screen of the Hill had already been
U||   noted by the invaders as the earth's only possible source of trouble.
U||   Thus the departure of the Boise had not gone unnoticed, and the fact,
U||   that, not even with his most penetrant rays could he see into her
U||   interior, had already given the Nevian commander some slight concern.
U||   Therefore, as soon as it was determined that the great ship was being
U||   directed toward Pittsburgh the fish-shaped cruiser of the void went
U||   into action.
U||   High in the stratosphere, speeding eastward, the immense mass of the
U||   Boise slowed abruptly, although no projector had slackened its effort.
U||   Cleveland, eyes upon interferometer grating and spectrophotometer
U||   charts, fingers flying over calculator keys, grinned as he turned
U||   toward Rodebush.
U||   "Just as you thought, Skipper; an ultra-band pusher. C4V63L29. Shall I
U||   give him a little pull?"
U||   "Not yet; let's feel him out a little before we force a close-up. We've
U||   got plenty of mass. See what he does when I put full push on the
U||   projectors."
U||   As the full power of the Terrestrial vessel was applied the Nevian was
U||   forced backward, away from the threatened city, against the full drive
U||   of her every projector. Soon, however, the advance was again checked,
U||   and both scientists read the reason upon their plates. The enemy had
U||   put down re-enforcing rods of tremendous power. Three compression
U||   members spread out fanwise behind her, bracing her against the low
U||   mountainside, while one huge tractor beam was thrust directly downward,
U||   holding in an unbreakable grip a cylinder of earth extending deep down
U||   into bedrock.
U||   "Two can play at that game!" And Rodebush drove down similar beams, and
U||   forward-reaching tractors as well. "Strap yourselves in solid,
U||   everybody!" he sounded a general warning. "Something is going to give
U||   way somewhere soon, and when it does we'll get a jolt!"
U||   And the promised jolt did indeed come soon. Prodigiously massive and
U||   powerful as the Nevian was, the Boise was even more massive and more
U||   powerful; and as the already enormous energy feeding the tractors,
U||   pushers, and projectors was raised to its inconceivable maximum, the
U||   vessel of the enemy was hurled upward, backward; and that of earth shot
U||   ahead with a bounding leap that threatened to strain even her mighty
U||   members. The Nevian anchor-rods had not broken; they had simply pulled
U||   up the vast cylinders of solid rock that had formed their anchorages.
U||   "Grab him now!" Rodebush yelled, and even while an avalanche of falling
U||   rock was burying the countryside, Cleveland snapped a tractor ray upon
U||   the flying fish and pulled tentatively.
U||   Nor did the Nevian now seem averse to coming to grips. The two warring
U||   super-dreadnaughts darted toward each other, and from the invader there
U||   flooded out the dread crimson opacity which had theretofore meant the
U||   doom of all things Solarian. It flooded out and engulfed the immense
U||   mass of humanity's hope in its spreading cloud of redly impenetrable
U||   murk. But not for long. Triplanetary's super-ship boasted no ordinary
U||   Terrestrial defense, but was sheathed in screen after screen of
U||   ultra-vibrations: imponderable walls, it is true, but barriers
U||   impenetrable to any unfriendly wave. To the outer screen the red veil
U||   of the Nevians clung tenaciously, licking greedily at every square inch
U||   of the shielding sphere of force, but unable to find an opening through
U||   which to feed upon the steel of the Boise's armor.
U||   "Get back--'way back! Go back and help Pittsburgh!" Rodebush drove an
U||   ultra-communicator beam through the murk to the instruments of the
U||   Terrestrial admiral; for the surviving warships of the Fleet--its most
U||   powerful units--were hurling themselves forward, to plunge into that
U||   red destruction. "None of you will last a second in this red field. And
U||   watch out for a violet field pretty soon--it'll be worse than this. We
U||   can handle them alone, I think; but if we can't, there's nothing in the
U||   System that can help us!"
U||   And now the hitherto passive screen of the super-ship became active. At
U||   first invisible, it began to glow in livid, violet light, and as the
U||   glow brightened to unbearable intensity the entire spherical shield
U||   began to increase in size. Driven outward from the super-ship as a
U||   center, its advancing surface of seething energy consumed the crimson
U||   murk as a billow of blast-furnace heat consumes a cloud of snowflakes
U||   in the air above its shaft. Nor was the red death-mist all that was
U||   consumed. Between that ravening surface and the armor skin of the Boise
U||   there was nothing. No debris, no atmosphere, no vapor, no single atom
U||   of material substance--the first time in Terrestrial experience that an
U||   absolute vacuum had ever been attained!
U||   Stubbornly contesting every foot of way lost, the Nevian fog retreated
U||   before the violet sphere of nothingness. Back and back it fell,
U||   disappearing altogether from all space as the violet tide engulfed the
U||   enemy vessel; but the flying fish did not disappear. Her triple screens
U||   flashed into furiously incandescent splendor and she entered,
U||   unscathed, that vacuous sphere, which collapsed instantly into an
U||   enormously elongated ellipsoid, at each focus a madly warring ship of
U||   space.
U||   Then in that tube of vacuum was waged a spectacular duel of
U||   ultra-weapons--weapons impotent in air, but deadly in empty space.
U||   Beams, rays, and rods of Titanic power smote cracklingly against
U||   ultra-screens equally capable. Time after time each contestant ran the
U||   gamut of the spectrum with his every available ultra-force, only to
U||   find all channels closed. For minutes the terrible struggle went on,
U||   then:
U||   "Cooper, Adlington, Spencer, Dutton!" Rodebush called into his
U||   transmitter. "Ready? Can't touch him on the ultra, so I'm going onto
U||   the macro-bands. Give him everything you have as soon as I collapse the
U||   violet. Go!"
U||   At the word the violet barrier went down, and with a crash as of a
U||   disrupting Universe the atmosphere rushed into the void. And through
U||   the hurricane there shot out the deadliest material weapons of
U||   Triplanetary. Torpedoes--non-ferrous, ultra-screened, beam-dirigible
U||   torpedoes charged with the most effective forms of material destruction
U||   known to man. Cooper hurled his canisters of penetrating gas, Adlington
U||   his atomic iron explosive bombs, Spencer his indestructible
U||   armor-piercing projectiles, and Dutton his shatterable flasks of the
U||   quintessence of corrosion--a sticky, tacky liquid of such dire potency
U||   that only one rare Solarian element could contain it. Ten, twenty,
U||   fifty, a hundred were thrown as fast as automatic machinery could
U||   launch them; and the Nevians found themselves adversaries not to be
U||   despised. Size for size, their screens were quite as capable as those
U||   of the Boise. The Nevians' destructive rays glanced harmlessly from
U||   their shields, and the Nevians' elaborate screens, neutralized at
U||   impact by those of the torpedoes, were impotent to impede their
U||   progress. Each projectile must needs be caught and crushed individually
U||   by beams of the most prodigious power; and while one was being
U||   annihilated dozens more were rushing to the attack. Then, while the
U||   twisting, dodging invader was busiest with the tiny but relentless
U||   destroyers, Rodebush launched his heaviest weapon.
U||   The macro-beams! Prodigious streamers of bluish-green flame which tore
U||   savagely through course after course of Nevian screen! Malevolent
U||   fangs, driven with such power and velocity that they were biting into
U||   the very walls of the enemy vessel before the amphibians knew their
U||   defensive shells of force had been punctured! And the emergency screens
U||   of the invaders were equally futile. Course after course was sent out,
U||   only to flare viciously through the spectrum and to go black!
U||   Outfought at every turn, the now frantically dodging Nevian leaped away
U||   in headlong flight, only to be brought to a staggering, crashing halt
U||   as Cleveland nailed her with a tractor beam. But the Terrestrials were
U||   to learn that the Nevians held in reserve a means of retreat. The
U||   tractor snapped--sheared off squarely by a sizzling plane of force--and
U||   the fish-shaped cruiser faded from Cleveland's sight, just as the Boise
U||   had disappeared from the communicator plates of Radio Center, back in
U||   the Hill, when she was launched. But though the plates in the control
U||   room could not hold the Nevian, she did not vanish beyond the ken of
U||   Randolph, now Communications Officer in the super-ship. For, warned and
U||   humiliated by his losing one speeding vessel from his plates in Radio
U||   Center, he was now ready for any emergency. Therefore as the Nevian
U||   fled, Randolph's spy-ray held her, automatically behind it as there was
U||   the full output of twelve special banks of iron-driven power tubes; and
U||   thus it was that the vengeful Terrestrials flashed immediately along
U||   the Nevians' line of flight. Inertialess now, pausing briefly from time
U||   to time to enable the crew to accustom themselves to the new
U||   sensations, the Boise pursued the invader; hurtling through the void
U||   with a velocity unthinkable.
U||   "He was easier to take than I thought he would be," Cleveland grunted,
U||   staring into the plate.
U||   "I thought he had more stuff, too," Rodebush assented; "but I guess
U||   Costigan got almost everything they had. If so, with all our own stuff
U||   and most of theirs besides, we should be able to take them. They must
U||   have neutralization, too, to take off like that; and if it's one
U||   hundred per cent we'll never catch them ... but it isn't--there they
U||   are!"
U||   "And this time I'm going to hold her or burn out all our generators
U||   trying," Cleveland declared, grimly. "Are you fellows down there able
U||   to handle yourselves yet? Fine! Start throwing out your cans!"
U||   Space-hardened veterans all, the other Terrestrial officers had fought
U||   off the horrible nausea of inertialessness, just as Rodebush and
U||   Cleveland had done. Again the ravening green macro-beams tore at the
U||   flying cruiser, again the mighty frames of the two space-ships
U||   shuddered sickeningly as Cleveland clamped on his tractor rod, again
U||   the highly dirigible torpedoes dashed out with their freights of death
U||   and destruction. And again the Nevian shear-plane of force slashed at
U||   the Terrestrial's tractor beam; but this time the mighty puller did not
U||   give way. Sparkling and spitting high-tension sparks, the plane bit
U||   deeply into the stubborn rod of energy. Brighter, thicker, and longer
U||   grew the discharges as the gnawing plane drew more and more power; but
U||   in direct ratio to that power the rod grew larger, denser, and ever
U||   harder to cut. More and more vivid became the pyrotechnic display of
U||   electric brilliance, until suddenly the entire tractor rod disappeared.
U||   At the same instant a blast of intolerable flame erupted from the
U||   Boise's flank and the whole enormous fabric of her shook and quivered
U||   under the force of a terrific detonation.
U||   "Randolph! I don't see them! Are they attacking or running?" Rodebush
U||   demanded. He was the first to realize what had happened.
U||   "Running--fast!"
U||   "Just as well, perhaps, but get their line. Adlington!"
U||   "Here!"
U||   "Good! Was afraid you were gone--that was one of your bombs, wasn't
U||   it?"
U||   "Yes. Well launched, just inside the screens. Don't see how it could
U||   have detonated unless something hot and hard struck it in the tube; it
U||   would need about that much time to explode. Good thing it didn't go off
U||   any sooner, or none of us would have been here. As it is, Area Six is
U||   pretty well done in, but the bulkheads held the damage to Six. What
U||   happened?"
U||   "We don't know, exactly. Both generators on the tractor beam went out.
U||   At first, I thought that was all, but my neutralizers are dead and I
U||   don't know what else. When the G-4's went out the fusion must have
U||   shorted the neutralizers. They would make a mess; it must have burned a
U||   hole down into number six tube. Cleveland and I will come down, and
U||   we'll all look around."
U||   Donning space-suits, the scientists let themselves into the damaged
U||   compartment through the emergency air-locks, and what a sight they saw!
U||   Both outer and inner walls of alloy armor had been blown away by the
U||   awful force of the explosion. Jagged plates hung awry; bent, twisted,
U||   and broken. The great torpedo tube, with all its intricate automatic
U||   machinery, had been driven violently backward and lay piled in hideous
U||   confusion against the backing bulkheads. Practically nothing remained
U||   whole in the entire compartment.
U||   "Nothing much we can do here," Rodebush said finally, through his
U||   transmitter, "Let's go see what number four generator room looks like."
U||   That room, although not affected by the explosion from without, had
U||   been quite as effectively wrecked from within. It was still stiflingly
U||   hot; its air was still reeking with the stench of burning lubricant,
U||   insulation, and metal; its floor was half covered by a semi-molten mass
U||   of what had once been vital machinery. For with the burning out of the
U||   generator bars the energy of the disintegrating allotropic iron had had
U||   no outlet, and had built up until it had broken through its insulation
U||   and in an irresistible flood of power had torn through all obstacles in
U||   its path of neutralization.
U||   "Hm-m-m. Should have had an automatic shut-off--one detail we
U||   overlooked," Rodebush mused. "The electricians can rebuild this stuff
U||   here, though--that hole in the hull is something else again."
U||   "I'll say it's something else," the grizzled Chief Engineer agreed.
U||   "She's lost all her spherical strength--anchoring a tractor with this
U||   ship now would turn her inside out. Back to the nearest Triplanetary
U||   shop for us, I would say."
U||   "Come again, Chief!" Cleveland advised the engineer. "None of us would
U||   live long enough to get there. We can't travel inertialess until the
U||   repairs are made, so if they can't be made without very much traveling,
U||   it's just too bad."
U||   "I don't see how we could support our jacks...." The engineer paused,
U||   then went on. "If you can't give me Mars or Tellus, how about some
U||   other planet? I don't care about atmosphere, or about anything but
U||   mass. I can stiffen her up in three or four days if I can sit down on
U||   something heavy enough to hold our jacks and presses; but if we have to
U||   rig up space-cradles around the ship herself it'll take a long
U||   time--months, probably. Haven't got a spare planet on hand, have you?"
U||   "We might have, at that," Rodebush made surprising answer. "A couple of
U||   seconds before we engaged we were heading toward a sun with at least
U||   two planets. I was just getting ready to dodge them when we cut the
U||   neutralizers, so they should be fairly close somewhere--yes, there's
U||   the sun, right over there. Rather pale and small; but it's close,
U||   comparatively speaking. We'll go back up into the control room and find
U||   out about the planets."
U||   The strange sun was found to have three large and easily located
U||   children, and observation showed that the crippled space-ship could
U||   reach the nearest of these in about five days. Power was therefore fed
U||   to the driving projectors, and each scientist, electrician, and
U||   mechanic bent to the task of repairing the ruined generators;
U||   rebuilding them to handle any load which the converters could possibly
U||   put upon them. For two days the Boise drove on; then her acceleration
U||   was reversed, and finally a landing was effected upon the forbidding,
U||   rocky soil of the strange world.
U||   It was larger than the earth, and of a somewhat stronger gravitation.
U||   Although its climate was bitterly cold, even in its short daytime, it
U||   supported a luxuriant but outlandish vegetation. Its atmosphere, while
U||   rich enough in oxygen and not really poisonous, was so rank with
U||   indescribably fetid vapors as to be scarcely breathable.
U||   But these things bothered the engineers not at all. Paying no attention
U||   to temperature or to scenery and without waiting for chemical analysis
U||   of the air, the space-suited mechanics leaped to their tasks; and in
U||   only a little more time than had been mentioned by the chief engineer
U||   the hull and giant frame of the super-ship were as staunch as of yore.
U||   "All right, Skipper!" came finally the welcome word. "You might try her
U||   out with a fast hop around this world before you shove off in earnest."
U||   Under the fierce blast of her projectors the vessel leaped ahead, and
U||   time after time, as Rodebush hurled her mass upon tractor beam or
U||   pressor, the engineers sought in vain for any sign of weakness. The
U||   strange planet half girdled and the severest tests passed flawlessly,
U||   Rodebush reached for his neutralizer switches. Reached and paused,
U||   dumfounded, for a brilliant purple light had sprung into being upon his
U||   panel and a bell rang out insistently.
U||   "What the blue blazes!" Rodebush shot out an exploring beam along the
U||   detector line and gasped. He stared, mouth open, then yelled:
U||   "Roger is here, rebuilding his planetoid! STATIONS ALL!"
U||CHAPTER XI
U||  Roger Carries On
U||   For gray Roger had not perished in the floods of Nevian energy which
U||   had destroyed his planetoid. While those terrific streamers of force
U||   emanating from the crimson obscurity surrounding the amphibians'
U||   space-ship were driving into his defensive screens, Roger sat impassive
U||   and immobile at his desk. His hard gray eyes moved methodically over
U||   his instruments and recorders; and after a few minutes he smiled
U||   coldly, while an expression of relief struggled fleetingly to move his
U||   expressionless face. Even though his screens were better than anyone
U||   had supposed, why admit it?
U||   "Baxter, Hartkopf, Chatelier, Anandrusung, Penrose, Nishimura,
U||   Mirsky...." He called off a list of names. "Report to me here at once!"
U||   "The planetoid is lost," he informed his select group of scientists
U||   when they had assembled, "and we must abandon it in exactly fifteen
U||   minutes, which will be the time required for the robots to fill this
U||   first section with our most necessary machinery and instruments. Pack
U||   each of you one box of the things he most wishes to take with him, and
U||   report back here in not more than thirteen minutes. Say nothing to
U||   anyone else."
U||   They filed out calmly, and as they passed out into the hall Baxter,
U||   perhaps a trifle less case-hardened than his fellows, at least voiced a
U||   thought for those they were so brutally deserting.
U||   "I say, it seems a bit thick to dash off this way and leave the rest of
U||   them; but still, I suppose...."
U||   "You suppose correctly." Bland and heartless Nishimura filled in the
U||   pause. "A small part of the planetoid may be able to escape; which, to
U||   me at least, is pleasantly surprising news. It cannot carry all of our
U||   men and mechanisms, therefore only the most important of both are
U||   saved. What would you? For the rest it is simply what you call 'the
U||   fortune of war,' no?"
U||   "But the beautiful...." began the amorous Chatelier.
U||   "Hush, fool!" snorted Hartkopf. "One word of that to the ear of Roger
U||   and you too are left behind. Of such non-essentials the Universe is
U||   full, to be collected in times of ease, but in times hard to be
U||   disregarded. Und this is a time of schrecklichkeit indeed!"
U||   And through that terrific conduit came speeding package after package
U||   of destruction.
U||   The group broke up, each man going to his own quarters; to meet again
U||   in the First Section a few minutes before the zero time. Roger's
U||   "office" was now packed so tightly with machinery and supplies that but
U||   little room was left for the scientists. The gray monstrosity still sat
U||   unmoved behind his dials.
U||   "But of what use is it, Roger?" the Russian physicist demanded. "Those
U||   waves are of some ultra-band, of a frequency immensely higher than
U||   anything heretofore known. Our screens should not have stopped them for
U||   an instant. It is a mystery that they have held so long, and certainly
U||   this single section will not be permitted to leave the planetoid
U||   without being destroyed."
U||   "There are many things you do not know, Mirsky," came the cold and
U||   level answer. "Our screens, which you think are of your own devising,
U||   have several improvements of my own in the formulae, and would hold
U||   forever had I the power to drive them. The screens of this section,
U||   being smaller, can be held as long as will be found necessary."
U||   "Power!" the dumfounded Russian exclaimed. "Why, we have almost
U||   infinite power--unlimited--sufficient for a lifetime of high
U||   expenditure!"
U||   But Roger made no reply, for the time of departure was at hand. He
U||   pressed down a tiny lever, and a robot in the power room threw in the
U||   gigantic plunger switches which launched against the Nevians the
U||   stupendous beam which so upset the complacence of Nerado the
U||   amphibian--the beam into which was poured recklessly every resource of
U||   power afforded by the planetoid, careless alike of burn-out and of
U||   exhaustion. Then, all the attention of the Nevians and the greater part
U||   of their power output devoted to the neutralization of that last
U||   desperate thrust, the metal wall of the planetoid opened and the First
U||   Section shot out into space. Full-driven as they were, Roger's screens
U||   flared white as he drove through the temporarily lessened attack of the
U||   Nevians; but in their preoccupation the amphibians did not notice the
U||   additional disturbance and the section tore on, unobserved and
U||   undetected. Far out in space, Roger raised his eyes from the instrument
U||   panel and continued the conversation as though it had not been
U||   interrupted.
U||   "Everything is relative, Mirsky, and you have misused gravely the term
U||   'unlimited.' Our power was, and is, very definitely limited. True, it
U||   then seemed ample for our needs, and is far superior to that possessed
U||   by the inhabitants of any solar system with which I am familiar; but
U||   the beings behind that red screen, whoever they are, have sources of
U||   power as far above ours as ours are above those of the Solarians."
U||   "How do you know?"
U||   "That power, what is it?" "We have, then, the analyses of those fields
U||   recorded!" Came simultaneous questions and explanations.
U||   "Their power-source is very probably the intra-atomic energy of iron;
U||   and if so, much remains to be done before I can proceed with my plan. I
U||   must have the most powerful structure in the known Universe before I
U||   can act. In the light of what I have just learned, the loss of the
U||   planetoid is but a trifle." Roger, as unmoved as one of his own
U||   automatons, was coldly analyzing the situation, thinking the thing
U||   through to its logical conclusion, paying no attention whatever to the
U||   losses of life, time and treasure now behind him.
U||   "But what can you do about it?" growled the Russian.
U||   "Many things. From the charts of the recorders we can compute their
U||   fields of force, and from that point it is only a step to their method
U||   of liberating the energy. We shall build robots. They shall build other
U||   robots, who shall in turn construct another planetoid; one this time
U||   that, wielding the theoretical maximum of power, will be suited to my
U||   needs."
U||   "And where will you build it? We are marked. Invisibility now is
U||   useless. Triplanetary will find us, even if we take up an orbit beyond
U||   that of Pluto!"
U||   "We have already left your Solarian system far behind. We are going to
U||   another system; one far enough removed so that the spy-rays of
U||   Triplanetary will never find us, and yet one that we can reach in a
U||   reasonable length of time with the energies at our command. Some
U||   fifteen days will be required for the journey, however, and our
U||   quarters are cramped. Therefore make places for yourselves wherever you
U||   can, and lessen the tedium of those fifteen days by working upon
U||   whatever problems are most pressing in your respective researches."
U||   The gray monster fell silent, immersed in what thoughts no one knew,
U||   and the scientists set out to obey his orders. Baxter, the British
U||   chemist, followed Penrose, the lantern-jawed, saturnine American
U||   engineer and inventor, as he made his way to the furthermost cubicle of
U||   the section.
U||   "I say, Penrose, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions, if you
U||   don't mind?"
U||   "Go ahead. Ordinarily it's dangerous to be a cackling hen anywhere
U||   around him, but he can't hear anything here now. His system is pretty
U||   well shot to pieces. You want to know all I know about Roger?"
U||   "Exactly so. You have been with him so much longer than I have, you
U||   know. In some ways he impresses one as being scarcely human, if you
U||   know what I mean. Ridiculous, of course, but of late I have been
U||   wondering whether he really is human. He knows too much, about too many
U||   things. He seems to be acquainted with many solar systems, to visit
U||   which would require life-times. Then, too, he has dropped remarks which
U||   would imply that he actually saw things that happened long before any
U||   living man could possibly have been born. Finally, he looks--well,
U||   peculiar--and certainly does not act human. I have been wondering, and
U||   have been able to learn nothing about him; as you have said, such talk
U||   as this aboard the planetoid was impossible."
U||   "You needn't worry about being paid your price; that's one thing. If we
U||   live--and that was part of the agreement, you know--we will all get
U||   what we sold out for. You will become a belted earl. I have already
U||   made millions, and shall make many more. Similarly, Chatelier has had
U||   and will have his women, Anandrusung and Nishimura their cherished
U||   revenges. Hartkopf his power, and so on." He eyed the other
U||   speculatively, then went on:
U||   "I might as well spill it all, since I'll never have a better chance
U||   and since you should know what the rest of us do. You're in the same
U||   boat with us and tarred with the same brush. There's a lot of gossip,
U||   that may or may not be true, but I know one very startling fact. Here
U||   it is. My great-great-grandfather left some notes which, taken in
U||   connection with certain things I myself saw on the planetoid, prove
U||   beyond question that our Roger went to Harvard University at the same
U||   time he did. Roger was a grown man then, and the elder Penrose noted
U||   that he was marked, like this," and the American sketched a cabalistic
U||   design.
U||   "What!" Baxter exclaimed. "An adept of North Polar Jupiter--them?"
U||   "Yes. That was before the First Jovian War, you know, and it was those
U||   medicine-men--really high-caliber scientists--that prolonged that war
U||   so...."
U||   "But I say, Penrose, that's really a bit thick. When they were wiped
U||   out it was proved a lot of hocus-pocus...."
U||   "Some of it was, but most of it wasn't," Penrose interrupted in turn.
U||   "I'm not asking you to believe anything except that one fact; I'm just
U||   telling you the rest of it. But it is also a fact that those adepts
U||   knew things and did things that take a lot of explaining. Now for the
U||   gossip, none of which is guaranteed. Roger is undoubtedly of Tellurian
U||   parentage, and the story is that his father was a moon-pirate, his
U||   mother a Greek adventuress. When the pirates were chased off the moon
U||   they went to Ganymede, you know, and some of them were captured by the
U||   Jovians. It seems that Roger was born at an instant of time sacred to
U||   the adepts, so they took him on. He worked his way up through the
U||   Forbidden Society as all adepts did, by various kinds of murder and job
U||   lots of assorted deviltries, until he got clear to the top--the
U||   seventy-seventh mystery...."
U||   "The secret of eternal youth!" gasped Baxter, awed in spite of himself.
U||   "Right, and he stayed Chief Devil, in spite of all the efforts of all
U||   his ambitious sub-devils to kill him, until the turning-point of the
U||   First Jovian War. He cut away then in a space-ship, and ever since then
U||   he has been working--and working hard--on some stupendous plan of his
U||   own that nobody else has ever got even an inkling of. That's the story.
U||   True or not, it explains a lot of things that no other theory can
U||   touch. And now I think you'd better shuffle along; enough of this is a
U||   great plenty!"
U||   Baxter went to his own cubby, and each man of the adept's cold-blooded
U||   crew methodically took up his task. True to prediction, in fifteen days
U||   a planet loomed beneath them and their vessel settled through a reeking
U||   atmosphere toward a rocky and forbidding plain. Then for another day
U||   they plunged along, a few thousand feet above the surface of that
U||   strange world, while Roger with his analytical detectors sought the
U||   most favorable location from which to wrest the materials necessary for
U||   his program of construction.
U||   It was a world of cold; its sun was distant, pale, and wan. It had
U||   monstrous forms of vegetation, of which each branch and member writhed
U||   and fought with a grotesque and horrible individual activity. Ever and
U||   anon a struggling part broke from its parent plant and darted away in
U||   independent existence; leaping upon and consuming or being consumed by
U||   a fellow creature equally monstrous. This flora was of a uniform
U||   color--a lurid, sickly yellow. In form some of it was fern-like, some
U||   cactus-like, some vaguely tree-like; but it was all outrageous,
U||   inherently repulsive to all Solarian senses. And no less hideous were
U||   the animal-like forms of life, which slithered and slunk rapaciously
U||   through that fantastic pseudo-vegetation. Snake-like, reptile-like,
U||   bat-like, the creatures squirmed, crawled, and flew; each covered with
U||   a dankly oozing yellow hide and each motivated by twin common
U||   impulses--to kill and insatiably and indiscriminately to devour. Over
U||   this reeking wilderness Roger drove his vessel, untouched by its
U||   disgusting, its appalling ferocity and horror.
U||   "There should be intelligence, of a kind," he mused, and swept the
U||   surface of the planet with an exploring beam. "Ah, yes, there is a
U||   city, of sorts," and in a few minutes the outlaws were looking down
U||   upon a metal-walled city of roundly conical buildings.
U||   Inside these structures and between and around them there scuttled
U||   formless blobs of matter, one of which Roger brought up into his vessel
U||   by means of a tractor ray. Held immovable by the beam it lay upon the
U||   floor, a strangely extensile, amoeba-like metal-studded mass of
U||   leathery substance. Of eyes, ears, limbs, or organs it apparently had
U||   none, yet it radiated an intensely hostile aura; a mental effluvium
U||   concentrated of rage and of hatred.
U||   "Apparently the ruling intelligence of the planet," Roger commented.
U||   "Such creatures are useless to us; we can build robots in half the time
U||   required for their subjugation and training. Still, it should not be
U||   permitted to carry back what it may have learned of us." As he spoke
U||   the adept threw the peculiar being out into the air and dispassionately
U||   rayed it out of existence.
U||   "That thing reminds me of a man I used to know, back in Penobscot."
U||   Penrose was as coldly callous as his unfeeling master. "The
U||   evenest-tempered man in town--mad all the time!"
U||   Eventually Roger found a location which satisfied his requirements of
U||   raw materials, and made a landing upon that unfriendly soil. Sweeping
U||   beams denuded a great circle of life, and into that circle leaped
U||   robots. Robots requiring neither rest nor food, but only lubricants and
U||   power; robots insensible alike to that bitter cold and to that noxious
U||   atmosphere.
U||   But the outlaws were not to win a foothold upon that inimical planet
U||   easily, nor were they to hold it without effort. Through the weird
U||   vegetation of the circle's bare edge there scuttled and poured along a
U||   horde of the metal-studded men--if "men" they might be called--who,
U||   ferocity incarnate, rushed the robot line. Mowed down by hundreds,
U||   still they came on; willing, it seemed to expend any number of lives in
U||   order that one living creature might once touch a robot with one
U||   out-thrust metallic stud. Whenever that happened there was a flash as
U||   of lightning, the heavy smoke of burning insulation, grease and metal,
U||   and the robot went down out of control. Recalling his remaining
U||   automatons, Roger sent out a shielding screen, against which the
U||   defenders of their planet raged in impotent fury. For days they hurled
U||   themselves and their every force against that impenetrable barrier,
U||   then withdrew: temporarily stopped, but by no means acknowledging
U||   defeat.
U||   Then, while Roger and his cohorts directed affairs from within their
U||   comfortable and now sufficiently roomy vessel, there came into being
U||   around it an industrial city of metal, peopled by metallic and
U||   insensate mechanisms. Mines were sunk, furnaces were blown in, smelters
U||   belched forth into the already unbearable air their sulphurous fumes,
U||   rolling mills and machine shops were built and equipped: and as fast as
U||   new enterprises were completed additional robots were ready to man
U||   them. In record time the heavy work of girders, members, and plates was
U||   well under way; and shortly thereafter light, deft, and multi-fingered
U||   mechanical men began the interminable task of building and installing
U||   the prodigious amount of precise machinery required for the vast
U||   structure. Roger was well content: but one day he was rudely awakened
U||   from his dream of complete isolation.
U||   Even though he had no reason to believe that there was anything
U||   dangerous within hundreds of millions of miles, it was Roger's cautious
U||   custom to release the screens from time to time, in order to allow his
U||   detectors to range out. This day, as he sent out his beams, his hard
U||   gray eyes grew even harder.
U||   "Mirsky! Nishimura! Come here!" he snapped, and showed them upon his
U||   plate an enormous sphere of steel, its rays flaming viciously. "Is
U||   there any doubt whatever in your minds as to the System to which that
U||   ship belongs?"
U||   "None at all--Triplanetarian," replied the Russian. "While larger than
U||   any I have seen before, its construction is unmistakable. They managed
U||   to trace us, and are testing out their weapons before attacking. Do we
U||   attack or do we run away?"
U||   "If Triplanetarian, and it surely is, we attack," coldly. "This one
U||   section is armed and powered to defeat Triplanetary's entire navy. We
U||   shall take that ship, and shall add its slight resources to our own.
U||   And it may even be that they have picked up the three who escaped
U||   me.... I have never yet been balked for long. Yes, we shall take that
U||   vessel. And those three sooner or later. Bradley I care nothing about
U||   ... but Costigan handled me ... and the woman...." Diamond-hard eyes
U||   glared balefully at the urge of thoughts to a clean and normal mind
U||   unthinkable.
U||   "To your posts," he ordered. "The robots will continue to function
U||   under their automatic controls during the short time it will require to
U||   abate this nuisance."
U||   "One moment!" A strange voice roared from the speakers. "Consider
U||   yourselves under arrest, by order of the Triplanetary Council!
U||   Surrender and you shall receive impartial hearing; fight us and you
U||   shall never come to trial. From what we have learned of Roger, we do
U||   not expect him to surrender, but if any of you other men wish to avoid
U||   immediate death, leave your vessel at once. We will come back for you
U||   later."
U||   "Any of you wishing to leave this vessel have my full permission to do
U||   so," Roger announced, disdaining any reply to the challenge of the
U||   Boise. "Any such, however, will not be allowed inside the planetoid
U||   area after the rest of us return from wiping out that patrol. We attack
U||   in one minute."
U||   "Would not one do better by stopping on?" Baxter, in the quarters of
U||   the American, was in doubt as to the most profitable course to pursue.
U||   "I should leave immediately if I thought that that ship could win; but
U||   I do not fancy that it can, do you?"
U||   "That ship? One Triplanetary ship against us?" Penrose laughed
U||   raucously. "Do as you please. I'd go in a minute if I thought that
U||   there was any chance of us losing; but there isn't, so I'm staying. I
U||   know which side my bread's buttered on. Those cops are bluffing, that's
U||   all. Not bluffing exactly, either, because they'll go through with it
U||   as long as they last. Foolish, but it's a way they have--they'll die
U||   trying every time, instead of running away, even when they know they're
U||   licked before they start. They don't use good judgment."
U||   "None of you are leaving? Very well, you each know what to do," came
U||   Roger's emotionless voice. The stipulated minute having elapsed, he
U||   advanced a lever and the outlaw cruiser slid quietly into the air.
U||   Toward the poised Boise Roger steered. Within range, he flung out a
U||   weapon new-learned and supposedly irresistible to any ferrous thing or
U||   creature, the red converter-field of the Nevians. For Roger's
U||   analytical detectors had stood him in good stead during those frightful
U||   minutes in the course of which the planetoid had borne the brunt of
U||   Nerado's superhuman attack; in such good stead that from the records of
U||   those ingenious instruments he and his scientists had been able to
U||   reconstruct not only the generators of the attacking forces, but also
U||   the screens employed by the amphibians in the neutralization of similar
U||   beams. With a vastly inferior armament the smallest of Roger's vessels
U||   had defeated the most powerful battleships of Triplanetary; what had he
U||   to fear in such a heavy craft as the one he now was driving, one so
U||   superlatively armed and powered? Well it was for his peace of mind that
U||   he had no inkling that the harmless-looking sphere he was so blithely
U||   attacking was in reality the much-discussed, half-mythical "super-ship"
U||   of Triplanetary's Secret Service; nor that its already unprecedented
U||   armament had been re-enforced, thanks to that hated Costigan, with
U||   Roger's own every worth-while idea, as well as with every weapon and
U||   defense known to that arch-Nevian, Nerado!
U||   Unknowing and contemptuous, Roger launched his converter field, and
U||   instantly found himself fighting for his very life. For from Rodebush
U||   at the controls down, the men of the Secret Service countered with wave
U||   after wave and with salvo after salvo of vibratory and material
U||   destruction. No thought of mercy for the men of the pirate ship could
U||   enter their minds. The outlaws had each been given a chance to
U||   surrender, and each had refused it. Refusing, they knew, as the
U||   Triplanetarians knew and as all modern readers know, meant that they
U||   were staking their lives upon victory. For with modern armaments it is
U||   seldom indeed that a single man lives through the defeat in battle of a
U||   war-vessel of space.
U||   Roger launched his field of red opacity, but it did not reach even
U||   Boise's screens. All space seemed to explode into violet splendor as
U||   Rodebush neutralized it, drove it back with his obliterating zone of
U||   force; but even that all-devouring zone could not touch Roger's
U||   peculiarly efficient screen. The outlaw vessel stood out, unharmed.
U||   Ultra-violet, infra-red, pure heat, infra-sound, solid beams of
U||   high-tension high-frequency current in whose paths the most stubborn
U||   metals would be volatilized instantly; all iron-driven, every deadly
U||   and torturing vibration known was hurled against that screen; but it,
U||   too, was iron-driven, and it held. Even the awful force of the
U||   macro-beam was dissipated by it--reflected, hurled away on all sides in
U||   coruscating torrents of blinding, dazzling energy. Cooper, Adlington,
U||   Spencer, and Dutton hurled against it their bombs and torpedoes--and
U||   still it held. But Roger's fiercest blasts and heaviest projectiles
U||   were equally impotent against the force-shields of the super-ship. The
U||   adept, having no liking for a battle upon anything like equal terms,
U||   sought safety in flight, only to be brought to a crashing, stunning
U||   halt by a massive tractor beam.
U||   "That must be that sixth-phase polycyclic screen that Conway reported
U||   on," Cleveland frowned in thought. "I've been doing a lot of work on
U||   that, and I think I've calculated an opener for it, Fred, but I'll have
U||   to have number ten projector and the whole output of number ten power
U||   room. Can you let me play with that much juice for a while? All right,
U||   Blake, tune her up to fifty-five thousand--there, hold it! Now, you
U||   other fellows, listen! I'm going to try to drill a hole through that
U||   screen with a hollow, quasi-solid beam: like a diamond drill cutting
U||   out a core. You won't be able to shove anything into the hole from
U||   outside the beam, so you'll have to steer your cans out through the
U||   central orifice of number ten projector--that'll be cold, since I'm
U||   going to use only the edge. I don't know how long I'll be able to hold
U||   the hole open, though so shoot them along as fast as you can. Ready?
U||   Here goes!"
U||   He pressed a series of contacts. Far below, in number ten converter
U||   room, massive switches drove home and the enormous mass of the vessel
U||   quivered under the terrific reaction of the newly-calculated,
U||   semi-material beam of energy that was hurled out, backed by the
U||   mightiest of all the mighty converters and generators of Triplanetary's
U||   super-dreadnaught. That beam, a pipe-like hollow cylinder of
U||   intolerable energy, flashed out, and there was a rending, tearing crash
U||   as it struck Roger's hitherto impenetrable wall. Struck and clung,
U||   grinding, boring in, while from the raging inferno that marked the
U||   circle of contact of cylinder and shield the pirates' screen radiated
U||   scintillating torrents of cracking, streaming sparks, lightning-like in
U||   length and in intensity.
U||   Deeper and deeper the gigantic drill was driven. It was through!
U||   Pierced Roger's polycyclic screen; exposed the bare metal of Roger's
U||   walls! And now, concentrated upon one point, flamed out in seemingly
U||   redoubled fury Triplanetary's raging rays--in vain. For even as they
U||   could not penetrate the screen, neither could they penetrate the wall
U||   of Cleveland's drill, but rebounded from it in the cascaded brilliance
U||   of thwarted lightning.
U||   "Oh, what a dumb-bell I am!" groaned Cleveland. "Why, oh why didn't I
U||   have somebody rig up a secondary SX7 beam on Ten's inner rings? Hop to
U||   it, will you, Blake, so that we'll have it in case they are able to
U||   stop the cans?"
U||   But the pirates could not stop all of Triplanetary's projectiles, now
U||   hurrying along inside the pipe as fast as they could be driven. In
U||   fact, for a few minutes desperate Roger, knowing that he faced his long
U||   life's gravest crisis, paid no attention to them at all, nor to any of
U||   his own useless offensive weapons: he struggled only and madly to break
U||   away from the savage grip of the Boise's tractor rod. Futile. He could
U||   neither cut nor stretch that inexorably anchoring beam. Then he devoted
U||   his every resource to the closing of that unbelievable breach in his
U||   shield; the barrier which through all previous emergencies had kept
U||   death at bay. Equally futile. His most desperate efforts resulted only
U||   in more frenzied displays of incandescence along the curved surface of
U||   contact of that penetrant cylinder. And through that terrific conduit
U||   came speeding package after package of destruction. Bombs, and
U||   armor-piercing shells, gas shells, and shells of poisonous and
U||   corrosive fluids followed each other in close succession. The surviving
U||   scientists of the planetoid, expert gunners and ray-men all, destroyed
U||   many of the projectiles, but it was not humanly possible to frustrate
U||   them all. And the breach could not be forced shut against the all but
U||   irresistible force of Cleveland's "opener". And with all his power
U||   Roger could not shift his vessel's position in the grip of
U||   Triplanetary's tractors sufficiently to bring a projector to bear upon
U||   the super-ship along the now unprotected axis of that narrow, but
U||   deadly tube.
U||   Thus it was that the end came soon. A war-head touched steel plating
U||   and there ensued a world-wracking explosion of atomic iron. Gaping
U||   wide, helpless, with all defenses down, other torpedoes entered the
U||   stricken hulk and completed its destruction even before they could be
U||   recalled. Explosive bombs literally tore the pirate vessel to
U||   fragments, while vials of pure corrosion dissolved her substance into
U||   dripping corruption and reeking gases filled every cranny of the
U||   wreckage as its torn and dismembered fragments began their long plunge
U||   to the ground. The space-ship followed the pieces down, and Rodebush
U||   sent out an exploring ray.
U||   " ... resistance was such that it was necessary to use corrosive, and
U||   ship and contents were completely disintegrated," he dictated into his
U||   vessel's log, some time later. "While there were of course no remains
U||   recognizable as human, it is practically certain that Roger and his
U||   last eleven men died.
U||   "Look here, Fred," Cleveland called his attention to the plate, upon
U||   which was pictured a horde of the peculiar inhabitants of the ghastly
U||   planet, wreaking their frenzied electrical wrath upon everything within
U||   the circle bared by Roger. "I was just going to suggest that we clean
U||   up that planetoid Roger started, but I see that the local boys are
U||   attending to it."
U||   "Just as well, perhaps. I would like to stay and study these people a
U||   little while, but we must get back on the trail of the Nevians," and
U||   the Boise leaped away into space, toward the line of flight of the
U||   amphibians.
U||   They reached that line and along it they traveled at full normal blast.
U||   As they traveled their detecting receivers and amplifiers were reaching
U||   out with their utmost power; ultra-instruments capable of rendering
U||   audible any signal originating within many light-years of them, upon
U||   any known frequency. And constantly at least two men were listening to
U||   those instruments with every sense concentrated in their ears.
U||   Listening--straining to distinguish in the deafening roar of background
U||   noise from the over-driven tubes any sign of voice or signal.
U||   Listening--while, millions upon untold millions of miles beyond even
U||   the prodigious reach of those ultra-instruments, three human beings,
U||   pitted against overwhelming odds, were even then sending out into empty
U||   space an almost hopeless appeal for the aid so desperately needed!
U||CHAPTER XII
U||  The Specimens Escape
U||   Knowing well that conversation with its fellows is one of the greatest
U||   needs of any intelligent being, the Nevians had permitted the
U||   Terrestrial specimens to retain possession of their ultra-beam
U||   communicators. Thus it was that Costigan had been able to keep in touch
U||   with his sweetheart and with Bradley. He learned that each had been
U||   placed upon exhibition in a different Nevian city: that the three had
U||   been separated in response to an insistent popular demand for such a
U||   distribution of the peculiar, but highly interesting creatures from a
U||   distant solar system. They had not been harmed. In fact, each was
U||   visited daily by a specialist, who made sure that his charge was being
U||   kept in the pink of condition.
U||   As soon as he became aware of this condition of things Costigan became
U||   morose. He sat still, drooped, and pined away visibly. He refused to
U||   eat, and of the worried specialist he demanded liberty. Then, failing
U||   in that as he knew he would fail, he demanded something to do. They
U||   pointed out to him, reasonably enough, that in such a civilization as
U||   theirs there was nothing he could do. They assured him that they would
U||   do anything they could to alleviate his mental suffering, but that
U||   since he was a museum piece he must see, himself, that he must be kept
U||   on display for a short time. Wouldn't he please behave himself and eat,
U||   as a reasoning being should? Costigan sulked a little longer, then
U||   wavered. Finally he agreed to compromise. He would eat and exercise if
U||   they would fit up a laboratory in his apartment, so that he could
U||   continue the studies he had begun upon his own native planet. To this
U||   they agreed, and thus it came about that one day the following
U||   conversation was held:
U||   "Clio? Bradley? I've got something to tell you this time. Haven't said
U||   anything before, for fear things might not work out, but they did. I
U||   went on a hunger strike and made them give me a complete laboratory. As
U||   a chemist I'm a darn good electrician; but luckily, with the sea-water
U||   they've got here, it's a very simple thing to make...."
U||   "Hold on!" snapped Bradley. "Somebody may be listening in on us!"
U||   "They aren't. They can't, without my knowing it, and I'll cut off the
U||   second anybody tries to synchronize with my beam. To resume--making
U||   Vee-Two is a very simple process, and I've got everything around here
U||   that's hollow clear full of it...."
U||   "How come they let you?" asked Clio.
U||   "Oh, they don't know what I'm doing. They watched me for a few days,
U||   and all I did was make up and bottle the weirdest messes imaginable.
U||   Then I finally managed to separate oxygen and nitrogen, after trying
U||   hard all of one day; and when they thought they saw that I didn't know
U||   anything about either one of them or what to do with them after I had
U||   them, they gave me up in disgust as a plain dumb ape and haven't paid
U||   any attention to me since. So I've got me plenty of kilograms of liquid
U||   Vee-Two, all ready to touch off. I'm getting out of here in about three
U||   minutes and a half, and I'm coming over after you folks, in a new,
U||   iron-powered space-speedster that they don't know I know anything
U||   about. They've just given it its final tests, and it's the slickest
U||   thing you ever saw."
U||   "But Conway, dearest, you can't possibly rescue me," Clio's voice
U||   broke. "Why, there are thousands of them, all around here. If you can
U||   get away, go, dear, but don't...."
U||   "I said I was coming after you, and if I can get away I'll be there. A
U||   good whiff of this stuff will lay out a thousand of them just as easily
U||   as it will one. Here's the idea. I've made a gas mask for myself, since
U||   I'll be in it where it's thick, but you two won't need any. The gas is
U||   soluble enough in water so that three or four thicknesses of wet cloth
U||   over your noses will be enough. I'll tell you when to wet down. We're
U||   going to break away or go out trying--there aren't enough amphibians
U||   between here and Andromeda to keep us humans cooped up like menagerie
U||   animals forever! But here comes my specialist with the keys to the
U||   city; time for the overture to start. See you later!"
U||   The Nevian physician directed his key-tube upon the transparent wall of
U||   the chamber and an opening appeared, an opening which vanished as soon
U||   as he had stepped through it; Costigan kicked a valve open; and from
U||   various innocent tubes there belched forth into the water of the
U||   central lagoon and into the air over it a flood of deadly vapor. As the
U||   Nevian turned toward the prisoner there was an almost inaudible hiss
U||   and a tiny jet of the frightful, outlawed stuff struck his open gills,
U||   just below his huge, conical head. He tensed momentarily, twitched
U||   convulsively just once, and fell motionless to the floor. And outside,
U||   the streams of avidly soluble liquefied gas rushed out into air and
U||   into water. It spread, dissolved, and diffused with the extreme
U||   mobility which is one of its characteristics; and as it diffused and
U||   was borne outward the Nevians, in their massed hundreds, died. Died not
U||   knowing what killed them; not knowing even that they died. Costigan,
U||   bitterly resentful of the inhuman treatment accorded the three and
U||   fiercely anxious for the success of his plan of escape, held his breath
U||   and, grimly alert, watched the amphibians die. When he could see no
U||   more motion anywhere he donned his gas-mask, strapped upon his back a
U||   large canister of the poison--his capacious pockets were already full
U||   of smaller containers--and two savagely exultant sentences escaped him.
U||   "I am a poor, ignorant specimen of ape, that can be let play with
U||   apparatus, am I?" he rasped, as he picked up the key-tube of the
U||   specialist and opened the door of his prison. "Maybe they'll learn
U||   sometime that it ain't always safe to judge by the looks of a flea how
U||   far he can jump!"
U||   He stepped out through the opening into the water, and, burdened as he
U||   was, made shift to swim to the nearest ramp. Up it he ran, toward a
U||   main corridor. But ahead of him there was wafted a breath of dread
U||   Vee-Two, and where that breath went, went also unconsciousness--an
U||   unconsciousness which would deepen gradually into permanent oblivion
U||   save for the prompt intervention of one who possessed, not only the
U||   necessary antidote, but the equally important knowledge of exactly how
U||   to use it. Upon the floor of that corridor were strewn Nevians, who had
U||   dropped in their tracks. Past or over their bodies Costigan strode,
U||   pausing only to direct a jet of lethal vapor into whatever branching
U||   corridor or open doorway caught his eye. He was going to the intake of
U||   the city's ventilation plant, and no unmasked creature dependent for
U||   life upon oxygen could bar his path. He reached the intake, tore the
U||   canister from his back, and released its full, vast volume of horrid
U||   contents into the primary air stream of the entire city.
U||   And all throughout that doomed city Nevians dropped; quietly and
U||   without a struggle, unknowing. Busy executives dropped upon their
U||   cushioned, flat-topped desks; hurrying travelers and messengers dropped
U||   upon the floors of the corridors or relaxed in the noxious waters of
U||   the ways; lookouts and observers dropped before their flashing screens;
U||   central operators of communications dropped under the winking lights of
U||   their panels. Observers and centrals in the outlying sections of the
U||   city wondered briefly at the unwonted universal motionlessness and
U||   stagnation; then the racing taint in water and in air reached them,
U||   too, and they ceased wondering--forever.
U||   Then through those quiet halls Costigan stalked to a certain storage
U||   room, where with all due precaution he donned his own suit of
U||   Triplanetary armor. Making an ungainly bundle of the other Solarian
U||   equipment stored there, he dragged it along behind him as he clanked
U||   back toward his prison, until he neared the dock at which was moored
U||   the Nevian space-speedster which he was determined to take. Here, he
U||   knew, was the first of many critical points. The crew of the vessel was
U||   aboard, and, with its independent air-supply, unharmed. They had
U||   weapons, were undoubtedly alarmed, and were very probably highly
U||   suspicious. They, too, had ultra-beams and might see him, but his very
U||   closeness to them would tend to protect him from ultra-beam
U||   observation. Therefore he crouched tensely behind a buttress, staring
U||   through his spy-ray goggles, waiting for a moment when none of the
U||   Nevians would be near the entrance, but grimly resolved to act
U||   instantly should he feel any touch of a spying ultra-beam.
U||   "Here's where the pinch comes," he growled to himself. "I know the
U||   combination, but if they're suspicious enough and act quick enough they
U||   can seal that door on me before I can get it open, and then rub me out
U||   like a blot; but ... ah!"
U||   The moment had arrived, before the touch of any revealing ray. He
U||   trained the key-tube, the entrance opened, and through that opening in
U||   the instant of its appearance there shot a brittle bulb of glass, whose
U||   breaking meant death. It crashed into fragments against a metallic wall
U||   and Costigan, entering the vessel, consigned its erstwhile crew one by
U||   one to the already crowded waters of the lagoon. He then leaped to the
U||   controls and drove the captured speedster through the air, to plunge it
U||   down upon the surface of the lagoon beside the door of the isolated
U||   structure which had for so long been his prison. Carefully he
U||   transferred to the vessel the motley assortment of containers of
U||   Vee-Two, and after a quick check-up to make sure that he had overlooked
U||   nothing, he shot his craft straight up into the air. Then only did he
U||   close his ultra-wave circuits and speak.
U||   "Clio, Bradley--I got away clean, without a bit of trouble. Now I'm
U||   coming after you, Clio."
U||   "Oh, it's wonderful that you got away, Conway!" the girl exclaimed.
U||   "But hadn't you better get Captain Bradley first? Then, if anything
U||   should happen, he would be of some use, while I...."
U||   "I'll knock him into an outside loop if he does!" the captain snorted,
U||   and Costigan went on:
U||   "You won't need to. You come first, Clio, of course. But you're too far
U||   away for me to see you with my spy, and I don't want to use the
U||   high-powered beam of this boat for fear of detection; so you'd better
U||   keep on talking, so that I can trace you."
U||   "That's one thing I am good at!" Clio laughed in sheer relief. "If
U||   talking were music, I'd be a full brass band!" and she kept up a flow
U||   of inconsequential chatter, until Costigan told her that it was no
U||   longer necessary; that he had established the line.
U||   "Any excitement around there yet?" he asked her then.
U||   "Nothing unusual that I can see," she replied. "Why? Should there be
U||   some?"
U||   "I hope not, but when I made my get-away I couldn't kill them all, of
U||   course, and I thought maybe they might connect things up with my
U||   jail-break and tell the other cities to take steps about you two. But I
U||   guess they're pretty well disorganized back there yet, since they can't
U||   know who hit them, or what with, or why. I must have got about
U||   everybody that wasn't sealed up somewhere, and it doesn't stand to
U||   reason that those who are left can check up very closely for a while
U||   yet. But they're nobody's fools--they'll certainly get conscious when I
U||   snatch you, maybe before ... there, I see your city, I think."
U||   "What are you going to do?"
U||   "Same as I did back there, if I can. Poison their primary air and all
U||   the water I can reach...."
U||   "Oh, Conway!" Her voice rose to a scream. "They must know--they're all
U||   getting out of the water and are rushing inside the buildings as fast
U||   as they possibly can!"
U||   "I see they are," grimly. "I'm right over you now, 'way up. Been
U||   locating their primary intake. They've got a dozen ships around it, and
U||   have guards posted all along the corridors leading to it; and those
U||   guards are wearing masks! They're clever birds, all right, those
U||   amphibians--they know what they got back there and how they got it.
U||   That changes things, girl! If we use gas here we won't stand a chance
U||   in the world of getting old Bradley. Stand by to jump when I open that
U||   door!"
U||   "Hurry, dear! They are coming out here after me!"
U||   "Sure they are." Costigan had already seen the two Nevians swimming out
U||   toward Clio's cage, and had hurled his vessel downward in a screaming
U||   power dive. "You're too valuable a specimen for them to let you be
U||   gassed, but if they can get there before I do they're traveling fast!"
U||   He miscalculated slightly, so that instead of coming to a halt at the
U||   surface of the liquid medium the speedster struck with a crash that
U||   hurled solid masses of water for hundreds of yards. But no ordinary
U||   crash could harm that vessel's structure, her gravity controls were not
U||   overloaded, and she shot back to the surface; gallant ship and reckless
U||   pilot alike unharmed. Costigan trained his key-tube upon the doorway of
U||   Clio's cell, then tossed it aside.
U||   "Different combinations over here!" he barked. "Got to cut you out--lie
U||   down in that far corner!"
U||   His hands flashed over the panel, and as Clio fell prone without
U||   hesitation or question a heavy beam literally blasted away a large
U||   portion of the roof of the structure. The speedster shot into the air
U||   and dropped down until she rested upon the tops of opposite walls;
U||   walls still glowing, semi-molten. The girl piled a stool upon the table
U||   and stood upon it, reached upward, and seized the mailed hands extended
U||   downward toward her. Costigan heaved her up into the vessel with a
U||   powerful jerk, slammed the door shut, leaped to the controls, and the
U||   speedster darted away.
U||   "Your armor's in that bundle there. Better put it on, and check your
U||   Lewistons and pistols--no telling what kind of jams we'll get into," he
U||   snapped, without turning. "Bradley, start talking ... all right, I've
U||   got your line. Better get your wet rags ready and get organized
U||   generally--every second will count by the time we get there. We're
U||   coming so fast that our outer plating's white hot, but it may not be
U||   fast enough, at that."
U||   "It isn't fast enough, quite," Bradley announced, calmly. "They're
U||   coming out after me now."
U||   "Don't fight them and probably they won't paralyze you. Keep on
U||   talking, so that I can find out where they take you."
U||   "No good, Costigan." The voice of the old space-flea did not reveal a
U||   sign of emotion as he made his dread announcement. "They have it all
U||   figured out. They're not taking any chances at all--they're going to
U||   paral...." His voice broke off in the middle of the word.
U||   With a bitter imprecation Costigan flashed on the powerful ultra-beam
U||   projector of the speedster and focused the plate upon Bradley's prison;
U||   careless now of detection, since the Nevians were already warned. Upon
U||   that plate he watched the Nevians carry the helpless body of the
U||   captain into a small boat, and continued to watch as they bore it into
U||   one of the largest buildings of the city. Up a series of ramps they
U||   took the still form, placing it finally upon a soft couch in an
U||   enormous and heavily guarded central hall. Costigan turned to his
U||   companion, Clio, and even through the helmets she could see plainly the
U||   white agony of his expression. He moistened his lips and tried twice to
U||   speak--tried and failed: but he made no move either to cut off their
U||   power or to change their direction.
U||   "Of course," she approved, steadily. "We are going through. I know that
U||   you want to run with me, but if you actually did it, I would never want
U||   to see you or hear of you again, and you would hate me forever."
U||   "Hardly that." The anguish did not leave his eyes and his voice was
U||   hoarse and strained, but his hands did not vary the course of the
U||   speedster by so much as a hair's breadth. "You're the finest little
U||   fellow that ever waved a plume, and I would love you no matter what
U||   happened. I'd trade my immortal soul to the devil if it would get you
U||   out of this mess, but we're both in it up to our necks and we can't dog
U||   it now. If they kill him we beat it--he and I both knew that it was on
U||   the chance of that happening that I took you first--but as long as all
U||   three of us are alive it's all three or none."
U||   "Of course," she said again, as steadily, thrilled this time to the
U||   depths of her being by the sheer manhood of him who had thus simply
U||   voiced his Code; a man of such fiber that neither love of life, nor the
U||   infinitely more powerful love of her which she knew he bore, could make
U||   him lower its high standard.
U||   "We are going through. Forget that I am a woman. We are three human
U||   beings, fighting a world full of monsters. I am simply one of us three.
U||   I will steer your ship, fire your projectors, or throw your bombs. What
U||   can I do best?"
U||   "Throw bombs," he directed, briefly. He knew what must be done were
U||   they to have even the slightest chance of winning clear. "I'm going to
U||   blast a hole down into the auditorium, and when I do you stand by that
U||   port and start dropping bottles of perfume. Throw a couple of big ones
U||   right down the shaft I make, and the rest of them most anywhere, after
U||   I cut the wall open. They'll do good wherever they hit, land or water."
U||   "But Captain Bradley--he'll be gassed, too." Her fine eyes were
U||   troubled.
U||   "Can't be helped. I've got the antidote, and it'll work any time under
U||   an hour. That'll be lots of time--if we aren't gone in less than ten
U||   minutes we'll be staying here. They're bringing in platoons of militia
U||   in full armor, and if we don't beat those boys to it we're in for
U||   plenty of grief. All right--start throwing!"
U||   The speedster had come to a halt directly over the imposing edifice
U||   within which Bradley was incarcerated, and a mighty beam had flared
U||   downward, digging a fiery well through floor after floor of stubborn
U||   metal. The ceiling of the amphitheater pierced, the beam expired; and
U||   down into that assembly hall there dropped two canisters of Vee-Two; to
U||   crash and to fill its atmosphere with imperceptible death. Then the
U||   beam flashed on again, this time at maximum power, and with it Costigan
U||   burned away half of the gigantic building. Burned it away until room
U||   above room gaped open, shelf-like, to outer atmosphere; the great hall
U||   now resembling an over-size pigeon-hole surrounded by smaller ones.
U||   Into that largest pigeon-hole the speedster darted, and cushioned desks
U||   and benches crashed down, crushed flat under its enormous weight as it
U||   came to rest upon the floor.
U||   Every available guard had been thrown into that room, regardless of
U||   customary occupation or of equipment. Most of them had been ordinary
U||   watchmen, not even wearing masks, and all such were already down. Many,
U||   however, were protected by masks, and a few were dressed in full armor.
U||   But no portable armor could mount defenses of sufficient power to
U||   withstand the awful force of the speedster's weapons, and one flashing
U||   swing of a projector swept the hall almost clear of life.
U||   "Can't shoot very close to Bradley with this big beam, but I'll mop up
U||   on the rest of them by hand. Stay here and cover me, Clio!" Costigan
U||   ordered, and went to open the door.
U||   "I can't--I won't!" Clio replied instantly. "I don't know the controls
U||   well enough. I'd kill you or Captain Bradley, sure; but I can shoot,
U||   and I'm going to!" and she leaped out, close upon his heels.
U||   Thus, flaming Lewiston in one hand and barking automatic in the other,
U||   the two mailed figures advanced toward Bradley; now doubly helpless:
U||   paralyzed by his enemies and gassed by his friends. For a time the
U||   Nevians melted away before them, but as they approached more nearly the
U||   couch, upon which the captain was, they encountered six figures encased
U||   in armor fully as capable as their own. The beams of the Lewistons
U||   rebounded from that armor in futile pyrotechnics, the bullets of the
U||   automatics spattered and exploded impotently against it. And behind
U||   that single line of armored guards were massed perhaps twenty
U||   unarmored, but masked, soldiers; and scuttling up the ramps leading
U||   into the hall were coming the platoons of heavily-armored figures which
U||   Costigan had previously seen.
U||   Decision instantly made, Costigan ran back toward the speedster, but he
U||   was not deserting his companions.
U||   "Keep the good work up!" he instructed the girl as he ran. "I'll pick
U||   those jaspers off with a pencil ray and then stand off the bunch that's
U||   coming while you rub out the rest of that crew there and drag Bradley
U||   back here."
U||   Back at the control panel, he trained a narrow, but intensely dense
U||   pencil of livid flame, and one by one the six armored figures fell.
U||   Then, knowing that Clio could handle the remaining opposition, he
U||   devoted his attention to the reenforcements so rapidly approaching from
U||   the sides. Again and again the heavy beam lashed out, now upon this
U||   side, now upon that, and in its flaming path Nevians disappeared. And
U||   not only Nevians--in the incredible energy of that beam's blast, floor,
U||   walls, ramps, and every material thing vanished in clouds of thick and
U||   brilliant vapor. The room temporarily clear of foes, he sprang again to
U||   Clio's assistance, but her task was nearly done. She had "rubbed out"
U||   all opposition and, tugging lustily at Bradley's feet, had already
U||   dragged him almost to the side of the speedster.
U||   "'At-a-girl, Clio!" cheered Costigan, as he picked up the burly captain
U||   and tossed him through the doorway. "Highly useful, girl of my dreams,
U||   as well as ornamental. In with you, and we'll start out to go places!"
U||   But getting the speedster out of the now completely ruined hall proved
U||   to be much more of a task than driving it in had been, for scarcely had
U||   the Terrestrials closed their locks than a section of the building
U||   collapsed behind them, cutting off their retreat. Nevian submarines and
U||   airships were beginning to arrive upon the scene, and were raying the
U||   building viciously in an attempt to entrap or to crush the Terrestrials
U||   in its ruins. Costigan managed finally to blast his way out, but the
U||   Nevians had had time to assemble in force and he was met by a
U||   concentrated storm of beams and of metal from every inimical weapon
U||   within range.
U||   But not for nothing had Conway Costigan selected for his dash for
U||   liberty the craft which, save only for the two immense interstellar
U||   cruisers, was the most powerful vessel ever built upon red Nevia. And
U||   not for nothing had he studied minutely and to the last, least detail
U||   every item of its controls and of its armament during wearily long days
U||   and nights of solitary imprisonment. He had studied it under test, in
U||   action, and at rest; studied it until he knew thoroughly its every
U||   possibility--and what a ship it was! The iron-driven generators of his
U||   shielding screens handled with ease the terrific load of the Nevians'
U||   assault, his polycyclic screens were proof against any material
U||   projectile, and the machines supplying his offensive beams with power
U||   were more than equal to their tasks. Driven now at full rating those
U||   frightful weapons lashed out against the Nevian blocking the way, and
U||   under their impacts her screens flared brilliantly through the spectrum
U||   and went down. And in the instant of their failure the enemy vessel was
U||   literally blown into nothingness--no unprotected metal, however
U||   resistant, could exist for a moment in the pathway of those iron-driven
U||   tornadoes of pure energy.
U||   Ship after ship of the Nevians plunged toward the speedster in
U||   desperately suicidal attempts to ram her down, but each met the same
U||   flaming fate before its mass could collide with the ship of the
U||   Terrestrials. Then, from the grouped submarines far below, there
U||   reached up red rods of force, which seized the space-ship and began
U||   relentlessly to draw her down.
U||   "What are they doing that for, Conway? They can't fight us!"
U||   "They don't want to fight us. They want to hold us, but I know what to
U||   do about that, too," and the powerful tractor rods snapped as a plane
U||   of lurid light drove through them. Upward now at the highest
U||   permissible velocity the speedster leaped, and past the few ships
U||   remaining above her she dodged; there was nothing now between her and
U||   the freedom of boundless space.
U||   "You did it, Conway; you did it!" Clio exulted. "Oh, Conway, you're
U||   just simply wonderful!"
U||   "I haven't done it yet," Costigan cautioned her. "The worst is yet to
U||   come. Nerado. He's why they wanted to hold us back, and why I was in
U||   such a hurry to get away. That boat of his is bad medicine, girl, and
U||   we want to put plenty of kilometers behind us before he gets started."
U||   "But do you think he will chase us?"
U||   "Think so? I know so! The mere facts, that we are rare specimens and
U||   that he told us that we were going to stay there all the rest of our
U||   lives, would make him chase us clear to Dustheimer's Nebula. Besides
U||   that, we stepped on their toes pretty heavily before we left. We know
U||   altogether too much now to be let get back to Tellus; and finally,
U||   they'd all die of acute enlargement of the spleen if we get away with
U||   this prize ship of theirs. I hope to tell you they'll chase us!"
U||   He fell silent, devoting his whole attention to his piloting, driving
U||   his craft onward at such velocity that its outer plating held steadily
U||   at the highest point of temperature compatible with safety. Soon they
U||   were out in open space, hurtling toward the sun under the drive of
U||   every possible iota of power, and Costigan took off his armor and
U||   turned toward the helpless body of the captain.
U||   "He looks so ... so ... so dead, Conway! Are you really sure that you
U||   can bring him to?"
U||   "Absolutely. Lots of time yet. Just three simple squirts in the right
U||   places will do the trick." He took from a locked compartment of his
U||   armor a small steel box, which housed a surgeon's hypodermic and three
U||   vials. One, two, three, he injected small, but precisely measured
U||   amounts of the fluids into the three vital localities, then placed the
U||   inert form upon a deeply cushioned couch.
U||   "There! That'll take care of the gas in five or six hours. The
U||   paralysis will wear off before that, so he'll be all right when he
U||   wakes up; and we're going away from here with every watt of power we
U||   can put out. We have done everything I know how to do, for the
U||   present."
U||   Then only did Costigan turn and look down, directly into Clio's eyes.
U||   Wide, eloquent blue eyes that gazed back up into his, tender and
U||   unafraid; eyes freighted with the oldest message of woman to chosen
U||   man. His hard young face softened wonderfully as he stared at her;
U||   there were two quick steps and they were in each other's arms. Clio's
U||   lithely rounded form nestled against Costigan's powerful body as his
U||   mighty arms tightened around her; his neck and shoulder were no less
U||   enthusiastically clasped, and less strongly only because of her woman's
U||   slighter musculature. Lips upon eager lips, blue eyes to gray,
U||   motionless they stood clasped in ecstasy; thinking nothing of the
U||   dreadful past, nothing of the fearful future, conscious only of the
U||   glorious, the wonderful present.
U||   "Clio mine ... darling ... girl, girl, how I love you!" Costigan's deep
U||   voice was husky with emotion. "I haven't kissed you for seven thousand
U||   years! I don't rate you, by hundreds of steps; but if I can just get
U||   you out of this mess, I swear by all the space...."
U||   "You needn't, lover. Rate me? Good Heavens, Conway? It's just the other
U||   way...."
U||   "Chop it!" he commanded in her ear. "I'm still dizzy at the idea of
U||   your loving me at all, to say nothing of loving me this way! But you
U||   do, and that's all I ask, here or hereafter!"
U||   "Love you? Love you!" Their mutual embrace tightened and her low voice
U||   thrilled brokenly as she went on: "Conway, dearest.... I can't say a
U||   thing, but you know.... Oh, Conway!"
U||   After a time Clio drew a long and tremulous, but supremely happy breath
U||   as the realities of their predicament once more obtruded themselves
U||   upon her consciousness. She released herself gently from Costigan's
U||   arms.
U||   "Do you really think that there is a chance of us getting back to the
U||   earth, so that we can be together ... always?"
U||   "A chance, yes. A probability, no," he replied, unequivocally. "It
U||   depends upon two things. First, how much of a start we got on Nerado.
U||   His ship is the biggest and fastest thing I ever saw, and if he strips
U||   her down and drives her--which he will--he'll catch us long before we
U||   can make Tellus. On the other hand, I gave Rodebush a lot of data, and
U||   if he and Lyman Cleveland can add it to their own stuff and get that
U||   super-ship of ours rebuilt in time, they'll be out here on the prowl;
U||   and they'll have what can give even Nerado plenty of argument. No use
U||   worrying about it, anyway. We won't know anything until we can detect
U||   one or the other of them, and then will be the time to do something
U||   about it."
U||   "If Nerado catches us, will you...." She paused.
U||   "Rub you out? I will not. Even if he does catch us, and takes us back
U||   to Nevia, I won't. There's lots more time coming onto the clock. Nerado
U||   won't hurt either of us badly enough to leave scars, either physical,
U||   mental, or moral. I'd kill you in a second if it were Roger; he's dirty
U||   and he's thoroughly bad. But Nerado's a good enough old scout, in his
U||   way. He's big and he's clean. You know, I could really like that fish,
U||   if I could meet him on terms of equality sometime?"
U||   "I couldn't!" she declared, vigorously. "He's crawly and scaly and
U||   snaky; and he smells so ... so...."
U||   "So rank and fishy?" Costigan laughed deeply. "Details, girl; mere
U||   details. I've seen people who looked like money in the bank and who
U||   smelled like a bouquet of violets that you couldn't trust half the
U||   length of Nerado's neck."
U||   "But look what he did to us!" she protested. "And they weren't trying
U||   to recapture us back there; they were trying to kill us."
U||   "That was perfectly all right, what he did and what they did--what else
U||   could they have done?" he wanted to know. "And while you're looking,
U||   look at what we did to them--plenty, I'd say. But we all had it to do,
U||   and neither side will blame the other for doing it. He's a square
U||   shooter, I tell you."
U||   "Well, maybe, but I don't like him a bit, and let's not talk about him
U||   any more. Let's talk about us. Remember what you said once, when you
U||   advised me to 'let you lay,' or whatever it was?" Woman-like, she
U||   wished to dip again lightly into the waters of pure emotion, even
U||   though she had such a short time before led the man out of their
U||   profoundest depths. But Costigan, into whose hard life love of woman
U||   had never before entered, had not yet recovered sufficiently from his
U||   soul-shaking plunge to follow her lead. Inarticulate, distrusting his
U||   newly found supreme happiness, he must needs stay out of those
U||   enchanted waters or plunge again. And he was afraid to
U||   plunge--diffident, still deeming himself unworthy of the miracle of
U||   this wonder-girl's love--even though every fiber of his being shrieked
U||   its demand to feel again that slender body in his clasping arms. He did
U||   not consciously think those thoughts. He acted them without thinking;
U||   they were inherent in his personality.
U||   "I do remember, and I still think it's a sound idea, even though I am
U||   too far gone now to let you put it into effect," he assured her, half
U||   seriously. He kissed her, tenderly and reverently, then studied her
U||   carefully. "But you look as though you'd been on a Martian picnic. When
U||   did you eat last?"
U||   "I don't remember, exactly. This morning, I think."
U||   "Or maybe last night, or yesterday morning? I thought so! Bradley and I
U||   can eat anything that's chewable, and drink anything that will pour,
U||   but you can't. I'll scout around and see if I can't fix up something
U||   that you'll be able to eat."
U||   He rummaged through the store-rooms, emerging with sundry viands from
U||   which he prepared a highly satisfactory meal.
U||   "Think you can sleep now, sweetheart?" After supper, once more within
U||   the circle of Costigan's arms, Clio nodded her head against his
U||   shoulder.
U||   "Of course I can, dear. Now that you are with me, out here alone, I'm
U||   not a bit afraid any more. You will get us back to the earth some way,
U||   sometime; I just know that you will. Good-night, Conway."
U||   "Good-night, Clio ... little sweetheart," he whispered, and went back
U||   to Bradley's side.
U||   In due time the captain recovered consciousness, and slept. Then for
U||   days the speedster flashed on toward our distant solar system; days
U||   during which her wide-flung detector screens remained cold.
U||   "I don't know whether I'm afraid they'll hit something or afraid that
U||   they won't," Costigan remarked more than once, but finally those
U||   tenuous sentinels did in fact encounter an interfering vibration. Along
U||   the detector line a visibeam sped, and Costigan's face hardened as he
U||   saw the unmistakable outline of Nerado's interstellar cruiser, far
U||   behind them.
U||   "Well, a stern chase always was a long one," Costigan said finally. "He
U||   can't catch us for plenty of days yet ... now what?" for the alarms of
U||   the detectors had broken out anew. There was still another point of
U||   interference to be investigated. Costigan traced it; and there, almost
U||   dead ahead of them, between them and their sun, nearing them at the
U||   incomprehensible rate of the sum of the two vessels' velocities, came
U||   another cruiser of the Nevians!
U||   "Must be the sister-ship, coming back from our System with a load of
U||   iron," Costigan deduced. "Heavily loaded as she is, we may be able to
U||   dodge her; and she's coming so fast that if we can stay out of her
U||   range we'll be all right--she won't be able to stop for probably three
U||   or four days. But if our super-ship is anywhere in these parts, now's
U||   the time for her to rally 'round!"
U||   He gave the speedster all the side-thrust she would take; then, putting
U||   every available communicator tube behind a tight beam, he drove it
U||   sunward and began sending out a long-continued call to his fellows of
U||   Triplanetary's Secret Service.
U||   Nearer and nearer the Nevian flashed, trying with all her power to
U||   intercept the speedster; and it soon became evident that, heavily laden
U||   though she was, she could make enough sideway to bring her within range
U||   at the time of meeting.
U||   "Of course, they've got partial neutralization of inertia, the same as
U||   we have," Costigan cogitated, "and by the way he's coming I'd say that
U||   he had orders to blow us out of the ether--he knows as well as we do
U||   that he can't capture us alive at anything like the relative velocities
U||   we've got now. I can't give her any more side thrust without
U||   overloading the gravity controls, so overloaded they've got to be.
U||   Strap down, you two, because they may go out entirely."
U||   "Do you think that you can pull away from them, Conway?" Clio was
U||   staring in horrified fascination into the plate, watching the pictured
U||   vessel increase in size, moment by moment.
U||   "I don't know, girl, but I'm going to try. Just in case we don't,
U||   though, I'm going to keep on yelling for help. In solid? All right,
U||   boat, DO YOUR STUFF!"
U||CHAPTER XIII
U||  The Meeting of the Giants
U||   "Check your blast, Fred, I think I hear something trying to come
U||   through!" Cleveland called out, sharply. For days the Boise had torn
U||   through the illimitable reaches of empty space, and now the long vigil
U||   of the keen-eared listeners was to be ended. Rodebush cut off his
U||   power, and through the deafening roar of tube-noise an almost inaudible
U||   voice made itself heard.
U||   " ... all the help you can give us. Samms--Cleveland--Rodebush--anybody
U||   of Triplanetary who can hear me, listen! This is Costigan, with Miss
U||   Marsden and Captain Bradley, heading for where we think the sun is,
U||   from right ascension about six hours, declination about plus fourteen
U||   degrees. Distance unknown, but probably hundreds of light-years. Trace
U||   my call. One Nevian ship is overhauling us slowly, another is coming
U||   toward us from the sun. We may or may not be able to dodge it, but we
U||   need all the help you can give us. Samms--Rodebush--Cleveland--anybody
U||   of Triplanetary...."
U||   Endlessly the faint, faint voice went on, but Rodebush and Cleveland
U||   were no longer listening. Sensitive ultra-loops had been swung, and
U||   along the indicated line shot Triplanetary's super-ship at a velocity
U||   which she had never before even approached; the utterly
U||   incomprehensible, almost incalculable velocity attained by inertialess
U||   matter, driven through an almost perfect vacuum by the Boise's maximum
U||   projector blast--a blast which would lift her stupendous normal tonnage
U||   against a gravity five times that of earth's! At the full frightful
U||   measure of that velocity the super-ship literally annihilated distance,
U||   while ahead of her the furiously driven, but scarcely faster spy-ray
U||   beam tore on in quest of the three Terrestrials who were calling for
U||   help.
U||   "Got any idea how fast we're going?" Rodebush demanded, glancing up for
U||   an instant from the observation plate. "We should be able to see him,
U||   since we could hear him, and our range is certainly as great as
U||   anything he can have."
U||   "No, can't figure velocity without any reliable data on how many atoms
U||   of matter exist per cubic meter out here." Cleveland was staring at the
U||   calculator. "It's constant, of course, at the value at which the
U||   friction of the medium is equal to our thrust. Incidentally, we can't
U||   hold it long. We're running a temperature, which shows that we're
U||   stepping along faster than anybody ever computed before. Taking
U||   Throckmorton's estimates it figures somewhere near the order of
U||   magnitude of ten to the twenty-seventh. Fast enough, anyway, so you'd
U||   better bend an eye on that plate. Even after you see him you won't know
U||   anything about where he really is, because we don't know any of the
U||   velocities involved--our own, his, or that of the beam--and we may be
U||   right on top of him."
U||   "Or, if we are outrunning the beam, we won't see him at all. That makes
U||   it nice piloting."
U||   "How are you going to handle things when we get there?"
U||   "Lock to them and take them aboard if we're in time. If not, if they
U||   are fighting already--there they are!"
U||   The picture of the speedster's control room flashed upon the plate and
U||   Costigan's voice greeted them from the speaker.
U||   "Hello, fellows, welcome to our city! Where are you?"
U||   "We don't know," Cleveland snapped back, "and we don't know where you
U||   are, either. Can't figure anything without data. I see you're still
U||   breathing air. Where are the Nevians? How much time we got yet?"
U||   "Not enough, I'm afraid. By the looks of things they will be within
U||   range of us in a couple of hours, and you're so far away yet that it
U||   took our voices four minutes and about fifty seconds to make the round
U||   trip, on the ultra! Play that on your calculator, Lyman! You haven't
U||   even touched our detector screen yet. I'm mighty glad to have seen you
U||   fellows again, though, anyway."
U||   "A couple of hours!" In his relief Cleveland almost shouted the words.
U||   "That's time to burn. We can be clear out of the Galaxy in less
U||   than...." He broke off at a yell from Rodebush.
U||   "Broadcast, Conway, broadcast!" that worthy had cried, as Costigan's
U||   image had disappeared utterly from his plate.
U||   Now he cut off the Boise's power, stopping her instantaneously in
U||   mid-space, but the connection had been broken. Costigan could not
U||   possibly have heard the orders to change his beam signal to a
U||   broadcast, so that they could pick it up; nor would it have done any
U||   good if he had heard and had obeyed. So immeasurably great had been
U||   their velocity that they had flashed past the speedster without seeing
U||   it, even upon the ultra-plates, and now they were unknown billions of
U||   miles beyond the fugitives they had come so far to help--far beyond the
U||   range of any possible broadcast. But Cleveland had understood instantly
U||   what had happened. He now had a little data upon which to work, and his
U||   fingers were flying over the keys of the calculator.
U||   "Back blast, maximum, seventeen seconds!" he directed, crisply. "Not
U||   exact, of course, but that'll put us close enough to find 'em with our
U||   detectors!"
U||   Then for the calculated seventeen seconds the super-ship retraced her
U||   path, at the same awful speed with which she had come so far. The blast
U||   expired and there, plainly limned upon the observation plates, was the
U||   Nevian speedster.
U||   "As a computer you're good," Rodebush applauded. "So close that we
U||   can't use the neutralizers to catch him. If we use a dyne of driving
U||   force we'll overshoot him a million kilometers before I can snap the
U||   switches out."
U||   "And yet he's so far away and going so fast that if we keep our inertia
U||   on it'll take all day at full drive to overtake him." Cleveland was
U||   frankly puzzled. "What to do? Shunt in a potentiometer?"
U||   "No, we don't need it." Rodebush turned to the transmitter. "Costigan!
U||   We are going to take hold of you with a very light tractor. Don't cut
U||   it!"
U||   "A tractor--inertialess?" Cleveland wondered.
U||   "Why not?" Rodebush launched the tractor, set at its absolute minimum
U||   of power, and threw in his master switches.
U||   While hundreds of thousands of miles separating the two vessels and the
U||   tractor beam was exerting the least effort of which it was capable, yet
U||   the super-ship leaped toward the smaller craft at a pace which covered
U||   that distance in the twinkling of an eye. So rapidly were the
U||   objectives enlarging upon the plates that the automatic focusing
U||   devices could scarcely function rapidly enough to keep them in place.
U||   Cleveland flinched involuntarily and seized his arm-rests in a
U||   spasmodic clutch as he watched this, the first inertialess
U||   space-approach; and even Rodebush, who knew better than anyone else
U||   what to expect, held his breath and swallowed hard at the unbelievable
U||   rate at which the two vessels were rushing together.
U||   And if these two, who had rebuilt the space-flyer, could hardly control
U||   themselves, what of the three in the speedster, who knew nothing
U||   whatever of the super-ship's potentialities? Clio, staring into the
U||   plate with Costigan, uttered a piercing shriek, as she sank her fingers
U||   into his shoulders. Bradley swore a mighty deep-space oath and braced
U||   himself against certain annihilation. Costigan stared for an instant,
U||   unable to believe his eyes, then his hand darted to the contacts which
U||   would cut the beam. Too late. Before his flying fingers could reach the
U||   studs the Boise was upon them; had struck them in direct central
U||   impact. Moving at the full measure of her unthinkable velocity though
U||   the super-ship was at the moment of impact, yet the most delicate
U||   recording instruments of the speedster could not detect the slightest
U||   shock as the enormous globe struck the comparatively tiny torpedo and
U||   clung to it; accommodating instantly and effortlessly her own terrific
U||   pace to that of the smaller and infinitely slower craft. Clio sobbed in
U||   relief and Costigan, one arm around her, sighed hugely.
U||   "Hey, you space-fleas!" he cried. "Glad to see you and all that, but
U||   you might as well kill a man outright as scare him to death! So that's
U||   the super-ship, huh? SOME ship!"
U||   "Hello, Conway!" "Clear ether, Conway!" The two scientists answered the
U||   hail of their fellow.
U||   "I didn't realize that an inertialess approach would be quite such a
U||   terrifying spectacle, or I would have warned you," Rodebush went on.
U||   "Yes, thanks to you, the super-ship works as she should, at last. But
U||   you had better put on your suits and transfer. You might get your
U||   things ready...."
U||   "'Things' is good!" Costigan laughed, and Clio giggled sunnily.
U||   "We've made so many transfers already that what you see us in is all we
U||   have," Bradley explained. "We'll bring ourselves, and we'll hurry; that
U||   Nevian is coming up fast."
U||   "Is there anything on this ship you fellows want?" Costigan asked.
U||   "There may be, but we haven't any locks big enough to let her inside
U||   and we haven't time to study her now. You might leave her controls in
U||   neutral, so that Lyman can calculate her position if we should want her
U||   later on."
U||   "All right." The three armor-clad figures stepped into the Boise's open
U||   lock, the tractor beam was cut off, and the speedster flashed away from
U||   the now stationary super-ship.
U||   "Better let formalities go for a while," Captain Bradley interrupted
U||   the general introduction taking place. "I was scared out of nine years'
U||   growth when I saw you coming at us, and maybe I've still got the humps;
U||   but that Nevian is coming up fast, and if you don't already know it I
U||   can tell you that he's no light cruiser."
U||   "That's so, too," Costigan concurred. "Have you fellows got enough
U||   stuff so that you think you can take him? You've got the legs on him,
U||   anyway--you can certainly run if you want to!"
U||   "Run?" Cleveland laughed. "We have a bone of our own to pick with that
U||   ship. We licked her to a standstill once, until we burned out a set of
U||   generators, and since we got them fixed we've been chasing her all over
U||   space. We were chasing her when we picked up your call. See there?
U||   She's doing the running."
U||   The Nevian was running, in truth. Her commander had seen and had
U||   recognized the great vessel which had flashed out of nowhere to the
U||   rescue of the three Terrestrials; and, having once been at grips with
U||   that vengeful super-dreadnaught, he had little stomach for another
U||   encounter. Therefore his side-thrust was now being exerted in the
U||   opposite direction; he was frankly trying to put as much distance as
U||   possible between himself and Triplanetary's formidable cruiser. In
U||   vain. A light tractor was clamped on and the Boise flashed up to close
U||   range before Rodebush threw on her inertia and Cleveland brought the
U||   two vessels relatively to rest by increasing gradually his tractor's
U||   pull. And this time the Nevian could not cut the tractor. Again that
U||   shearing plane of force bit into it and tore at it, but it neither
U||   yielded nor broke. The rebuilt generators of Number Four were designed
U||   to carry the load, and they carried it. And again Triplanetary's every
U||   mighty weapon was brought into play.
U||   The "cans" were thrown, ultra-and infra-beams were driven, the furious
U||   macro-beam gnawed hungrily at the Nevian's defenses; and one by one
U||   those defenses went down. In desperation the enemy commander threw his
U||   every generator behind a polycyclic screen; only to see Cleveland's
U||   even more powerful drill bore relentlessly through it. Punctured that
U||   last defense, the end came soon. A secondary SX7 beam was now in place
U||   on mighty Ten's inner rings, and one fierce blast blew a hole
U||   completely through the Nevian cruiser. Into that hole entered
U||   Adlington's terrific bombs and their gruesome fellows, and where they
U||   entered, life departed. All defenses vanished, and under the blasts of
U||   the Boise's projectors, now unopposed, the metal of the Nevian vessel
U||   exploded instantly into a widely spreading cloud of vapor. Sparkling
U||   vapor, with perhaps here and there a droplet or two of material which
U||   had only been liquefied.
U||   So passed the sister-ship, and Rodebush turned his plates upon the
U||   vessel of Nerado. But that highly intelligent amphibian had seen all
U||   that had occurred. He had long since given over the pursuit of the
U||   speedster, and he did not rush in to do hopeless battle beside his
U||   fellow Nevians against the Terrestrials. His analytical detectors had
U||   written down each detail of every weapon and of every screen employed;
U||   and even while prodigious streamers of red force were raving out from
U||   his vessel, braking her terrific progress and swinging her around in an
U||   immense circle back toward far Nevia, his scientists and mechanics were
U||   doubling and redoubling the power of his already Titanic installations,
U||   to match and if possible to overmatch those of Triplanetary's
U||   super-dreadnaught.
U||   "Do we kill him now or do we let him suffer a while longer?" Costigan
U||   demanded.
U||   "I don't think so, yet," replied Rodebush. "Would you, Lyman?"
U||   "Not yet," replied Cleveland, grimly, reading the thought of the other
U||   and agreeing with it. "Let him pilot us to Nevia; we might not be able
U||   to find it without a guide. While we're at it we want to so pulverize
U||   that crowd that if they never come near the Solarian system again
U||   they'll think it's twenty minutes too soon!"
U||   Thus it was that the Boise, under only a few dynes of propulsion,
U||   pursued the Nevian ship. Apparently exerting every effort, she never
U||   came quite within range of the fleeing raider; yet never was she so far
U||   behind that the Nevian space-ship was not in clear register upon her
U||   observation plates. Nor was Nerado alone in strengthening his vessel.
U||   Costigan knew well and respected highly the Nevian scientist-captain,
U||   and at his suggestion the entire time of the long and uneventful flight
U||   was spent in re-enforcing the super-ship's armament to the iron-driven
U||   limit of theoretical and mechanical possibility.
U||   Thus, when Nevia and her hot, blue sun appeared upon his plates
U||   Rodebush was ready for any emergency, and hurled his battleship upon
U||   the Nevian with every weapon aflame. But so was Nerado ready; and,
U||   unlike her sister-ship, his vessel was manned by scientists well versed
U||   in the fundamental theory of the weapons with which they fought. Beams,
U||   rods, and lances of energy flamed and flared; planes and pencils cut,
U||   slashed, and stabbed; defensive screens glowed redly or flashed
U||   suddenly into intensely brilliant, coruscating incandescence. Crimson
U||   opacity struggled sullenly against violet curtain of annihilation.
U||   Material projectiles and torpedoes were launched under full beam
U||   control; only to be exploded harmlessly in mid-space, to be rayed into
U||   nothingness, or to disappear innocuously against impenetrable
U||   polycyclic screens. Both vessels were equipped completely with
U||   iron-driven mechanisms; both were manned by scientists capable of
U||   wringing the last possible watt of power from their sources. They were
U||   approximately equal in size, and each ship now wielded the theoretical
U||   ultimate of power for her mass; therefore neither could harm the other,
U||   furiously though each was trying. And more and more nearly they were
U||   approaching the red atmosphere of the world of the amphibians. Down
U||   into that crimson blanket the two warring space-ships dropped, down
U||   toward a city which Costigan recognized as that in which Nerado made
U||   his headquarters.
U||   "Better hold off a bit," Costigan cautioned. "If I know that bird at
U||   all, he's cooking up something," and even as he spoke there shot upward
U||   from the city a multitude of flashing balls. The Nevians had mastered
U||   the secret of the explosive of the fishes of the greater deeps and were
U||   launching it in a veritable storm against the Terrestrial visitor.
U||   "Those?" asked Rodebush, calmly. The detonating balls of destruction
U||   were literally annihilating even the atmosphere beyond the polycyclic
U||   screen, but that barrier was scarcely affected.
U||   "No, that," pointing out a hemispherical dome which, redly translucent,
U||   surrounded a group of buildings towering high above their neighbors.
U||   "Neither those high towers nor those screens were there the last time I
U||   was in this town. They're stalling for time down there, that's all
U||   those fireballs are for. Good sign, too--maybe they aren't ready for us
U||   yet. If not, you'd better take 'em while the taking's good; and if they
U||   are ready for us, we'd better get out of here while we're all in one
U||   piece."
U||   And in fact Nerado had been in touch with the scientists of his city;
U||   had been instructing them in the construction of converters and
U||   generators of such weight and power that they could crush even the
U||   defenses of the super-ship. They were not, however, quite done; the
U||   entirely unsuspected possibilities of speed inherent in absolute
U||   inertialessness had not entered into Nerado's calculations.
U||   "Better drop a few cans down on that dome, fellows, before they make
U||   trouble for us," suggested Rodebush to his gunners.
U||   "We can't," came Adlington's instant reply. "We've been trying it, but
U||   that's a polycyclic screen. Can you drill it? If you can, I've got a
U||   real bomb here--that special we built--that will do the trick if you
U||   can protect it from their beams until it gets down into the water."
U||   "I'll try it," Cleveland answered, at a nod from the physicist. "I
U||   couldn't drill Nerado's polycyclics, but I couldn't use any momentum on
U||   him. Couldn't ram him--he fell back with my thrust. But that screen
U||   down there can't back off, so maybe I can work on it. Get your special
U||   ready, and hang on, everybody!"
U||   The Boise looped upward, and from an altitude of miles dove downward
U||   through a storm of force-balls, rays, and shells; a dive checked
U||   abruptly as the hollow tube of energy, which was Cleveland's drill,
U||   snarled savagely down ahead of her and struck the shielding hemisphere
U||   with a grinding, lightning-splitting shock. As it struck, backed by all
U||   the enormous momentum of the plunging space-ship and driven by the full
U||   power of her mightiest generators, it bored in, clawing and gouging
U||   viciously through the tissue of that rigid and unyielding barrier of
U||   pure energy. Then, mighty drill and plunging mass against iron-driven
U||   wall, eye-tearing and furiously spectacular warfare was waged. Well it
U||   was for Triplanetary, that day, that its super ship carried ample
U||   supply of allotropic iron; well it was that her originally Gargantuan
U||   converters and generators had been doubled and quadrupled in power on
U||   the long Nevian way! For that oven-girdled fortress was powered to
U||   withstand any conceivable assault; but the Boise's power and momentum
U||   were now inconceivable, and every watt and every dyne was solidly
U||   behind that hellishly flaming, that voraciously tearing, that
U||   irresistibly ravening cylinder of energy incredible!
U||   Through the Nevian shield that cylinder gnawed its frightful way, and
U||   down its protecting length there drove Adlington's "Special" bomb.
U||   "Special" it was indeed; so great of girth that it could barely pass
U||   through the central orifice of Ten's mighty projector, so heavily
U||   charged with sensitized atomic iron that its detonation upon any planet
U||   would not have been considered for an instant if that planet's
U||   integrity meant anything to its attackers. Down the shielding pipe of
U||   force the "Special" screamed under full propulsion, and beneath the
U||   surface of Nevia's ocean it plunged.
U||   "Cut!" yelled Adlington, and as the scintillating drill expired, the
U||   bomber snapped his detonating switch.
U||   For a moment the effect of the explosion seemed unimportant. A dull,
U||   low rumble was all that was to be heard of a concussion that jarred red
U||   Nevia to her very center; and all that could be seen was a slow heaving
U||   of the water. But that heaving did not cease. Slowly, so slowly it
U||   seemed to the observers now high in the heavens, the waters rose up and
U||   parted; revealing a vast chasm blown deep into the ocean's rocky bed.
U||   Higher and higher the lazy, mountains of water reared; effortlessly to
U||   pick up, to smash, to grind into fragments, and finally to toss aside
U||   every building, every structure, every scrap of material substance
U||   pertaining to the whole Nevian city.
U||   Flattened out, driven backward for miles the tortured waters were
U||   urged, leaving exposed bare ground and broken rock where once had been
U||   the ocean's busy floor; while tremendous blasts of incandescent gas
U||   raved upward, buffeting even the enormous masses of the two
U||   space-ships, poised by their breathless crews so high above the site of
U||   the explosion. Then the displaced millions of tons of water rushed back
U||   into that newly rived pit, seeming to seek in that mad rush to make
U||   even more complete the already total destruction of the city. The
U||   raging torrents poured into that yawning cavern, filled it, and piled
U||   mountainously above it; receding and piling up, again and again,
U||   causing tidal waves which swept a full half of Nevia's mighty, watery
U||   globe.
U||   The city forever silenced, Rodebush again directed his weapons upon
U||   Nerado's vessel, but the Nevian was no longer fighting. For the first
U||   time in that long and bitter engagement, not a Nevian beam was in
U||   operation. His screens, however, were as capable as ever, and after a
U||   few fruitless attempts to make an impression upon them, Rodebush cut
U||   off his own offensive and turned to Costigan.
U||   "What do you make of it, Conway? You know these people better than we
U||   do; what are they up to?"
U||   "I wish to talk to you," Nerado's voice came from the speaker, "and I
U||   could not do so while the beams were operating. You are, I now
U||   perceive, a much higher form of life than any of us had thought
U||   possible; a form perhaps as high in evolution as our own. It is a pity
U||   that we did not meet you when we first neared your planet, so that much
U||   life, both Tellurian and Nevian, might have been spared. But what is
U||   past cannot be recalled. As reasoning beings, however, you will see the
U||   futility of continuing a contest in which neither of us is capable of
U||   injuring the other. You may, of course, destroy more of our Nevian
U||   cities, in which case I should be compelled to go and destroy similarly
U||   upon your earth; but, to reasoning minds, such a course of procedure is
U||   sheerest folly."
U||   Rodebush cut the communicator beam.
U||   "Does he mean it?" he demanded of Costigan. "It sounds reasonable,
U||   but...."
U||   "But fishy," broke in Cleveland. "Altogether too reasonable for a...."
U||   "Yes, he means it; every word of it," interrupted Costigan in turn.
U||   "That's the way they are. Reasonable, passionless. Funny--they lack a
U||   lot of things we have, but they've got a lot of things that I wish more
U||   of us Tellurians had too. Give me the plate--I'll talk for
U||   Triplanetary," and the beam was restored.
U||   "Captain Nerado." he greeted the Nevian commander. "Having been with
U||   you and among your people, I know that you mean what you say and that
U||   you speak for your race. Similarly, I believe that I can speak for the
U||   Triplanetary Council--the government of three of the planets of our
U||   solar system--in saying that there need be no more conflict between our
U||   peoples. I also was compelled by circumstances to do certain things
U||   which I now wish could be undone; but as you have said, the past is
U||   past. Our two races have much to gain from each other by friendly
U||   exchanges of materials and of ideas, while we can expect nothing except
U||   mutual extermination, if we elect to continue this warfare. I offer you
U||   the friendship of Triplanetary. Will you release your screens and come
U||   aboard to sign a treaty?"
U||   "I will come; my screens are down." Rodebush likewise cut off his
U||   power, although somewhat apprehensively, and a Nevian lifeboat entered
U||   the main airlock of the Boise.
U||   Then, at a table in the control room of Triplanetary's first
U||   super-ship, there was written the first Inter-Systemic Treaty. Upon one
U||   side the three Nevians; amphibious, cone-headed, loop-necked,
U||   scale-bodies, four-legged things to us monstrosities: upon the other
U||   the three humans, air-breathing, rounded-headed, shortnecked,
U||   smooth-bodied, two-legged creatures equally monstrous to the fastidious
U||   Nevians. Yet each of these representatives, of two races so different,
U||   felt respect for the other race increase within him minute by minute as
U||   the conversation went on.
U||   The Nevians had destroyed Pittsburgh, but Adlington's bomb had blown an
U||   equally populous Nevian city out of existence. One Nevian vessel had
U||   wiped out an entire unit of Triplanetary's fleet; but Costigan,
U||   practically unaided, had depopulated one Nevian city and had seriously
U||   damaged another. He had also beamed down many Nevian ships. Therefore
U||   loss of life and material could be balanced. The Solarian system was
U||   rich in iron, to which the Nevians were welcome; red Nevia possessed
U||   abundant stores of substances which upon earth were extremely rare and
U||   of vital importance. Therefore commerce was to be encouraged. The
U||   Nevians had knowledges and skills unknown to earthly science, but were
U||   entirely ignorant of many things, to us commonplace. Therefore
U||   interchange of students and of books was highly desirable. And so on.
U||   Thus was signed the Triplanetario-Nevian Treaty of Eternal Peace.
U||   Nerado and his two companions were escorted ceremoniously to their
U||   vessel, and the Boise took off in an inertialess dash toward earth,
U||   bearing the good news that the Nevian menace was no more.
U||   Clio, now a hardened space-flea, immune even to the horrible nausea of
U||   inertialessness, wriggled lithely in the curve of Costigan's arm and
U||   laughed up at him.
U||   "You can talk all you want to, Conway, but I don't like them a bit.
U||   They give me the purple jitters! I suppose that they are really
U||   estimable folks; talented, cultured, and everything; but just the same
U||   I'll bet that it will be a long, long time before anybody on earth will
U||   really, truly like them!"

U||   Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
U||   law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so

U||   States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
U||   Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this
U||   license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg™
U||   electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™ concept and

U||   Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
U||   eBook, complying with the trademark license is very easy. You may use
U||   this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works,
U||   reports, performances and research. Project Gutenberg eBooks may be

U||   work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept
U||   all the terms of this license and intellectual property
U||   (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

U||   terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
U||   entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
U||   1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be used
U||   on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree
U||   to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that
U||   you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without
U||   complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C
U||   below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™
U||   electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help
U||   preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. See
U||   paragraph 1.E below.
U||   1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
U||   Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
U||   of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works
U||   in the collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
U||   individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States
U||   and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to
U||   prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or
U||   creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references
U||   to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will
U||   support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to
U||   electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in
U||   compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project
U||   Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily comply with
U||   the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format
U||   with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when you share it
U||   without charge with others.
U||   1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
U||   what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
U||   a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
U||   the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
U||   before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
U||   creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
U||   Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning the
U||   copyright status of any work in any country other than the United
U||   States.
U||   1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
U||   1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
U||   access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear prominently
U||   whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work on which the
U||   phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project
U||   Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
U||   copied or distributed:
U||   This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
U||   most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
U||   restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
U||   under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
U||   eBook or online at [2]www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
U||   United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you
U||   are located before using this eBook.
U||   1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is derived
U||   from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a
U||   notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright
U||   holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United
U||   States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or
U||   providing access to a work with the phrase “Project Gutenberg”
U||   associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with
U||   the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission
U||   for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™ trademark as set
U||   forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
U||   1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
U||   with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
U||   must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
U||   terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked
U||   to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works posted with the
U||   permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

U||   License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

U||   electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
U||   prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
U||   active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
U||   Gutenberg™ License.
U||   1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
U||   compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
U||   any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
U||   to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other
U||   than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version
U||   posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website (www.gutenberg.org),
U||   you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
U||   copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
U||   request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other
U||   form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg™
U||   License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
U||   1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
U||   performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works unless
U||   you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
U||   1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
U||   access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works provided
U||   that:
U||     * • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
U||       the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you
U||       already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to
U||       the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to
U||       donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg
U||       Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within
U||       60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally
U||       required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments
U||       should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg
U||       Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4,
U||       “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
U||       Archive Foundation.”
U||     * • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who
U||       notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt
U||       that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project
U||       Gutenberg™ License. You must require such a user to return or
U||       destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and
U||       discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project
U||       Gutenberg™ works.
U||     * • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
U||       any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
U||       electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
U||       receipt of the work.
U||     * • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
U||       distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
U||   1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg™
U||   electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth
U||   in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from the
U||   Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of the
U||   Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in
U||   Section 3 below.
U||   1.F.
U||   1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
U||   effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
U||   works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
U||   Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
U||   electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
U||   contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
U||   or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
U||   intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
U||   other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
U||   be read by your equipment.
U||   1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
U||   of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
U||   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
U||   Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
U||   Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability
U||   to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE
U||   THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF
U||   WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH
U||   1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY
U||   DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL,
U||   DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF
U||   YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
U||   1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
U||   defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
U||   receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
U||   written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
U||   received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
U||   your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
U||   the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
U||   refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
U||   providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
U||   receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
U||   is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
U||   opportunities to fix the problem.
U||   1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
U||   in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER
U||   WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
U||   TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
U||   1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
U||   warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
U||   If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates
U||   the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall
U||   be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted
U||   by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
U||   provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
U||   1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
U||   trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
U||   providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance
U||   with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
U||   promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works,
U||   harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
U||   that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you
U||   do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project
U||   Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or
U||   deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
U||   Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
U||   Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
U||   electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
U||   including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
U||   because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
U||   people in all walks of life.
U||   Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
U||   assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
U||   goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
U||   freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
U||   Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
U||   and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To
U||   learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and
U||   how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
U||   Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
U||   Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
U||   Foundation
U||   The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
U||   501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state
U||   of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue
U||   Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is
U||   64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
U||   Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S.
U||   federal laws and your state’s laws.
U||   The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
U||   Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
U||   date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and
U||   official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
U||   Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
U||   Literary Archive Foundation
U||   Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
U||   public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
U||   number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
U||   distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of
U||   equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
U||   $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
U||   with the IRS.
U||   The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
U||   charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
U||   States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
U||   considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
U||   with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
U||   we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
U||   DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
U||   state visit [3]www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||   While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
U||   have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
U||   against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
U||   approach us with offers to donate.
U||   International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
U||   statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
U||   the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
U||   Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
U||   methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
U||   including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
U||   please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||   Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic
U||   works
U||   Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
U||   concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
U||   with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
U||   Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
U||   Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
U||   editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
U||   the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
U||   necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
U||   edition.
U||   Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:
U||   [4]www.gutenberg.org.
U||   This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including
U||   how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
U||   Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
U||   our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
