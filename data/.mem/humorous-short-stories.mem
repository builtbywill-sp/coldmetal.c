U||INTRODUCTION
U||   This volume does not aim to contain all “the best American humorous
U||   short stories”; there are many other stories equally as good, I
U||   suppose, in much the same vein, scattered through the range of American
U||   literature. I have tried to keep a certain unity of aim and impression
U||   in selecting these stories. In the first place I determined that the
U||   pieces of brief fiction which I included must first of all be not
U||   merely good stories, but good short stories. I put myself in the
U||   position of one who was about to select the best short stories in the
U||   whole range of American literature,[2][1] but who, just before he
U||   started to do this, was notified that he must refrain from selecting
U||   any of the best American short stories that did not contain the element
U||   of humor to a marked degree. But I have kept in mind the wide
U||   boundaries of the term humor, and also the fact that the humorous
U||   standard should be kept second—although a close second—to the short
U||   story standard.
U||   In view of the necessary limitations as to the volume’s size, I could
U||   not hope to represent all periods of American literature adequately,
U||   nor was this necessary in order to give examples of the best that has
U||   been done in the short story in a humorous vein in American literature.
U||   Probably all types of the short story of humor are included here, at
U||   any rate. Not only copyright restrictions but in a measure my own
U||   opinion have combined to exclude anything by Joel Chandler Harris—Uncle
U||   Remus—from the collection. Harris is primarily—in his best work—a
U||   humorist, and only secondarily a short story writer. As a humorist he
U||   is of the first rank; as a writer of short stories his place is hardly
U||   so high. His humor is not mere funniness and diversion; he is a
U||   humorist in the fundamental and large sense, as are Cervantes,
U||   Rabelais, and Mark Twain.
U||   No book is duller than a book of jokes, for what is refreshing in small
U||   doses becomes nauseating when perused in large assignments. Humor in
U||   literature is at its best not when served merely by itself but when
U||   presented along with other ingredients of literary force in order to
U||   give a wide representation of life. Therefore “professional literary
U||   humorists,” as they may be called, have not been much considered in
U||   making up this collection. In the history of American humor there are
U||   three names which stand out more prominently than all others before
U||   Mark Twain, who, however, also belongs to a wider classification: “Josh
U||   Billings” (Henry Wheeler Shaw, 1815–1885), “Petroleum V. Nasby” (David
U||   Ross Locke, 1833–1888), and “Artemus Ward” (Charles Farrar Browne,
U||   1834–1867). In the history of American humor these names rank high; in
U||   the field of American literature and the American short story they do
U||   not rank so high. I have found nothing of theirs that was first-class
U||   both as humor and as short story. Perhaps just below these three should
U||   be mentioned George Horatio Derby (1823–1861), author of Phoenixiana
U||   (1855) and the Squibob Papers (1859), who wrote under the name “John
U||   Phoenix.” As has been justly said, “Derby, Shaw, Locke and Browne
U||   carried to an extreme numerous tricks already invented by earlier
U||   American humorists, particularly the tricks of gigantic exaggeration
U||   and calm-faced mendacity, but they are plainly in the main channel of
U||   American humor, which had its origin in the first comments of settlers
U||   upon the conditions of the frontier, long drew its principal
U||   inspiration from the differences between that frontier and the more
U||   settled and compact regions of the country, and reached its highest
U||   development in Mark Twain, in his youth a child of the American
U||   frontier, admirer and imitator of Derby and Browne, and eventually a
U||   man of the world and one of its greatest humorists.”[3][2] Nor have
U||   such later writers who were essentially humorists as “Bill Nye” (Edgar
U||   Wilson Nye, 1850–1896) been considered, because their work does not
U||   attain the literary standard and the short story standard as creditably
U||   as it does the humorous one. When we come to the close of the
U||   nineteenth century the work of such men as “Mr. Dooley” (Finley Peter
U||   Dunne, 1867- ) and George Ade (1866- ) stands out. But while these two
U||   writers successfully conform to the exacting critical requirements of
U||   good humor and—especially the former—of good literature, neither—though
U||   Ade more so—attains to the greatest excellence of the short story. Mr.
U||   Dooley of the Archey Road is essentially a wholesome and wide-poised
U||   humorous philosopher, and the author of Fables in Slang is chiefly a
U||   satirist, whether in fable, play or what not.
U||   This volume might well have started with something by Washington
U||   Irving, I suppose many critics would say. It does not seem to me,
U||   however, that Irving’s best short stories, such as The Legend of Sleepy
U||   Hollow and Rip Van Winkle, are essentially humorous stories, although
U||   they are o’erspread with the genial light of reminiscence. It is the
U||   armchair geniality of the eighteenth century essayists, a constituent
U||   of the author rather than of his material and product. Irving’s best
U||   humorous creations, indeed, are scarcely short stories at all, but
U||   rather essaylike sketches, or sketchlike essays. James Lawson
U||   (1799–1880) in his Tales and Sketches: by a Cosmopolite (1830), notably
U||   in The Dapper Gentleman’s Story, is also plainly a follower of Irving.
U||   We come to a different vein in the work of such writers as William
U||   Tappan Thompson (1812–1882), author of the amusing stories in letter
U||   form, Major Jones’s Courtship (1840); Johnson Jones Hooper (1815–1862),
U||   author of Widow Rugby’s Husband, and Other Tales of Alabama (1851);
U||   Joseph G. Baldwin (1815–1864), who wrote The Flush Times of Alabama and
U||   Mississippi (1853); and Augustus Baldwin Longstreet (1790–1870), whose
U||   Georgia Scenes (1835) are as important in “local color” as they are
U||   racy in humor. Yet none of these writers yield the excellent short
U||   story which is also a good piece of humorous literature. But they
U||   opened the way for the work of later writers who did attain these
U||   combined excellences.
U||   The sentimental vein of the midcentury is seen in the work of Seba
U||   Smith (1792–1868), Eliza Leslie (1787–1858), Frances Miriam Whitcher
U||   (“Widow Bedott,” 1811–1852), Mary W. Janvrin (1830–1870), and Alice
U||   Bradley Haven Neal (1828–1863). The well-known work of Joseph Clay Neal
U||   (1807–1847) is so all pervaded with caricature and humor that it
U||   belongs with the work of the professional humorist school rather than
U||   with the short story writers. To mention his Charcoal Sketches, or
U||   Scenes in a Metropolis (1837–1849) must suffice. The work of Seba Smith
U||   is sufficiently expressed in his title, Way Down East, or Portraitures
U||   of Yankee Life (1854), although his Letters of Major Jack Downing
U||   (1833) is better known. Of his single stories may be mentioned The
U||   General Court and Jane Andrews’ Firkin of Butter (October, 1847,
U||   Graham’s Magazine). The work of Frances Miriam Whitcher (“Widow
U||   Bedott”) is of somewhat finer grain, both as humor and in other
U||   literary qualities. Her stories or sketches, such as Aunt Magwire’s
U||   Account of Parson Scrantum’s Donation Party (March, 1848, Godey’s
U||   Lady’s Book) and Aunt Magwire’s Account of the Mission to Muffletegawmy
U||   (July, 1859, Godey’s), were afterwards collected in The Widow Bedott
U||   Papers (1855-56-80). The scope of the work of Mary B. Haven is
U||   sufficiently suggested by her story, Mrs. Bowen’s Parlor and Spare
U||   Bedroom (February, 1860, Godey’s), while the best stories of Mary W.
U||   Janvrin include The Foreign Count; or, High Art in Tattletown (October,
U||   1860, Godey’s) and City Relations; or, the Newmans’ Summer at
U||   Clovernook (November, 1861, Godey’s). The work of Alice Bradley Haven
U||   Neal is of somewhat similar texture. Her book, The Gossips of
U||   Rivertown, with Sketches in Prose and Verse (1850) indicates her field,
U||   as does the single title, The Third-Class Hotel (December, 1861,
U||   Godey’s). Perhaps the most representative figure of this school is
U||   Eliza Leslie (1787–1858), who as “Miss Leslie” was one of the most
U||   frequent contributors to the magazines of the 1830’s, 1840’s and
U||   1850’s. One of her best stories is The Watkinson Evening (December,
U||   1846, Godey’s Lady’s Book), included in the present volume; others are
U||   The Batson Cottage (November, 1846, Godey’s Lady’s Book) and Juliet
U||   Irwin; or, the Carriage People (June, 1847, Godey’s Lady’s Book). One
U||   of her chief collections of stories is Pencil Sketches (1833–1837).
U||   “Miss Leslie,” wrote Edgar Allan Poe, “is celebrated for the homely
U||   naturalness of her stories and for the broad satire of her comic
U||   style.” She was the editor of The Gift one of the best annuals of the
U||   time, and in that position perhaps exerted her chief influence on
U||   American literature When one has read three or four representative
U||   stories by these seven authors one can grasp them all. Their titles as
U||   a rule strike the keynote. These writers, except “the Widow Bedott,”
U||   are perhaps sentimentalists rather than humorists in intention, but
U||   read in the light of later days their apparent serious delineations of
U||   the frolics and foibles of their time take on a highly humorous aspect.
U||   George Pope Morris (1802–1864) was one of the founders of The New York
U||   Mirror, and for a time its editor. He is best known as the author of
U||   the poem, Woodman, Spare That Tree, and other poems and songs. The
U||   Little Frenchman and His Water Lots (1839), the first story in the
U||   present volume, is selected not because Morris was especially prominent
U||   in the field of the short story or humorous prose but because of this
U||   single story’s representative character. Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849)
U||   follows with The Angel of the Odd (October, 1844, Columbian Magazine),
U||   perhaps the best of his humorous stories. The System of Dr. Tarr and
U||   Prof. Fether (November, 1845, Graham’s Magazine) may be rated higher,
U||   but it is not essentially a humorous story. Rather it is incisive
U||   satire, with too biting an undercurrent to pass muster in the company
U||   of the genial in literature. Poe’s humorous stories as a whole have
U||   tended to belittle rather than increase his fame, many of them verging
U||   on the inane. There are some, however, which are at least excellent
U||   fooling; few more than that.
U||   Probably this is hardly the place for an extended discussion of Poe,
U||   since the present volume covers neither American literature as a whole
U||   nor the American short story in general, and Poe is not a humorist in
U||   his more notable productions. Let it be said that Poe invented or
U||   perfected—more exactly, perfected his own invention of—the modern short
U||   story; that is his general and supreme achievement. He also stands
U||   superlative for the quality of three varieties of short stories, those
U||   of terror, beauty and ratiocination. In the first class belong A
U||   Descent into the Maelstrom (1841), The Pit and the Pendulum (1842), The
U||   Black Cat (1843), and The Cask of Amontillado (1846). In the realm of
U||   beauty his notable productions are The Assignation (1834), Shadow: a
U||   Parable (1835), Ligeia (1838), The Fall of the House of Usher (1839),
U||   Eleonora (1841), and The Masque of the Red Death (1842). The tales of
U||   ratiocination—what are now generally termed detective stories—include
U||   The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) and its sequel, The Mystery of
U||   Marie Rogêt (1842–1843), The Gold-Bug (1843), The Oblong Box (1844),
U||   “Thou Art the Man” (1844), and The Purloined Letter (1844).
U||   Then, too, Poe was a master of style, one of the greatest in English
U||   prose, possibly the greatest since De Quincey, and quite the most
U||   remarkable among American authors. Poe’s influence on the short story
U||   form has been tremendous. Although the effects of structure may be
U||   astounding in their power or unexpectedness, yet the means by which
U||   these effects are brought about are purely mechanical. Any student of
U||   fiction can comprehend them, almost any practitioner of fiction with a
U||   bent toward form can fairly master them. The merit of any short story
U||   production depends on many other elements as well—the value of the
U||   structural element to the production as a whole depends first on the
U||   selection of the particular sort of structural scheme best suited to
U||   the story in hand, and secondly, on the way in which this is combined
U||   with the piece of writing to form a well-balanced whole. Style is more
U||   difficult to imitate than structure, but on the other hand the origin
U||   of structural influence is more difficult to trace than that of style.
U||   So while, in a general way, we feel that Poe’s influence on structure
U||   in the short story has been great, it is difficult rather than obvious
U||   to trace particular instances. It is felt in the advance of the general
U||   level of short story art. There is nothing personal about
U||   structure—there is everything personal about style. Poe’s style is both
U||   too much his own and too superlatively good to be successfully
U||   imitated—whom have we had who, even if he were a master of structural
U||   effects, could be a second Poe? Looking at the matter in another way,
U||   Poe’s style is not his own at all. There is nothing “personal” about it
U||   in the petty sense of that term. Rather we feel that, in the case of
U||   this author, universality has been attained. It was Poe’s good fortune
U||   to be himself in style, as often in content, on a plane of universal
U||   appeal. But in some general characteristics of his style his work can
U||   be, not perhaps imitated, but emulated. Greater vividness, deft
U||   impressionism, brevity that strikes instantly to a telling effect—all
U||   these an author may have without imitating any one’s style but rather
U||   imitating excellence. Poe’s “imitators” who have amounted to anything
U||   have not tried to imitate him but to vie with him. They are striving
U||   after perfectionism. Of course the sort of good style in which Poe
U||   indulged is not the kind of style—or the varieties of style—suited for
U||   all purposes, but for the purposes to which it is adapted it may well
U||   be called supreme.
U||   Then as a poet his work is almost or quite as excellent in a somewhat
U||   more restricted range. In verse he is probably the best artist in
U||   American letters. Here his sole pursuit was beauty, both of form and
U||   thought; he is vivid and apt, intensely lyrical but without much range
U||   of thought. He has deep intuitions but no comprehensive grasp of life.
U||   His criticism is, on the whole, the least important part of his work.
U||   He had a few good and brilliant ideas which came at just the right time
U||   to make a stir in the world, and these his logical mind and telling
U||   style enabled him to present to the best advantage. As a critic he is
U||   neither broad-minded, learned, nor comprehensive. Nor is he, except in
U||   the few ideas referred to, deep. He is, however, limitedly
U||   original—perhaps intensely original within his narrow scope. But the
U||   excellences and limitations of Poe in any one part of his work were his
U||   limitations and excellences in all.
U||   As Poe’s best short stories may be mentioned: Metzengerstein (Jan. 14,
U||   1832, Philadelphia Saturday Courier), Ms. Found in a Bottle (October
U||   19, 1833, Baltimore Saturday Visiter), The Assignation (January, 1834,
U||   Godey’s Lady’s Book), Berenice (March, 1835, Southern Literary
U||   Messenger), Morella (April, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger), The
U||   Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall (June, 1835, Southern
U||   Literary Messenger), King Pest: a Tale Containing an Allegory
U||   (September, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger), Shadow: a Parable
U||   (September, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger), Ligeia (September,
U||   1838, American Museum), The Fall of the House of Usher (September,
U||   1839, Burton’s Gentleman’s Magazine), William Wilson (1839: Gift for
U||   1840), The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion (December, 1839, Burton’s
U||   Gentleman’s Magazine), The Murders in the Rue Morgue (April, 1841,
U||   Graham’s Magazine), A Descent into the Maelstrom (May, 1841, Graham’s
U||   Magazine), Eleonora (1841: Gift for 1842), The Masque of the Red Death
U||   (May, 1842, Graham’s Magazine), The Pit and the Pendulum (1842: Gift
U||   for 1843), The Tell-Tale Heart (January, 1843, Pioneer), The Gold-Bug
U||   (June 21 and 28, 1843, Dollar Newspaper), The Black Cat (August 19,
U||   1843, United States Saturday Post), The Oblong Box (September, 1844,
U||   Godey’s Lady’s Book), The Angel of the Odd (October, 1844, Columbian
U||   Magazine), “Thou Art the Man” (November, 1844, Godey’s Lady’s Book),
U||   The Purloined Letter (1844: Gift for 1845), The Imp of the Perverse
U||   (July, 1845, Graham’s Magazine), The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof.
U||   Fether (November, 1845, Graham’s Magazine), The Facts in the Case of M.
U||   Valdemar (December, 1845, American Whig Review), The Cask of
U||   Amontillado (November, 1846, Godey’s Lady’s Book), and Lander’s Cottage
U||   (June 9, 1849, Flag of Our Union). Poe’s chief collections are: Tales
U||   of the Grotesque and Arabesque (1840), Tales (1845), and The Works of
U||   the Late Edgar Allan Poe (1850–56). These titles have been dropped from
U||   recent editions of his works, however, and the stories brought together
U||   under the title Tales, or under subdivisions furnished by his editors,
U||   such as Tales of Ratiocination, etc.
U||   Caroline Matilda Stansbury Kirkland (1801–1864) wrote of the frontier
U||   life of the Middle West in the mid-nineteenth century. Her principal
U||   collection of short stories is Western Clearings (1845), from which The
U||   Schoolmaster’s Progress, first published in The Gift for 1845 (out in
U||   1844), is taken. Other stories republished in that collection are The
U||   Ball at Thram’s Huddle (April, 1840, Knickerbocker Magazine),
U||   Recollections of the Land-Fever (September, 1840, Knickerbocker
U||   Magazine), and The Bee-Tree (The Gift for 1842; out in 1841). Her
U||   description of the country schoolmaster, “a puppet cut out of shingle
U||   and jerked by a string,” and the local color in general of this and
U||   other stories give her a leading place among the writers of her period
U||   who combined fidelity in delineating frontier life with sufficient
U||   fictional interest to make a pleasing whole of permanent value.
U||   George William Curtis (1824–1892) gained his chief fame as an essayist,
U||   and probably became best known from the department which he conducted,
U||   from 1853, as The Editor’s Easy Chair for Harper’s Magazine for many
U||   years. His volume, Prue and I (1856), contains many fictional elements,
U||   and a story from it, Titbottom’s Spectacles, which first appeared in
U||   Putnam’s Monthly for December, 1854, is given in this volume because it
U||   is a good humorous short story rather than because of its author’s
U||   general eminence in this field. Other stories of his worth noting are
U||   The Shrouded Portrait (in The Knickerbocker Gallery, 1855) and The
U||   Millenial Club (November, 1858, Knickerbocker Magazine).
U||   Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909) is chiefly known as the author of the
U||   short story, The Man Without a Country (December, 1863, Atlantic
U||   Monthly), but his venture in the comic vein, My Double; and How He
U||   Undid Me (September, 1859, Atlantic Monthly), is equally worthy of
U||   appreciation. It was his first published story of importance. Other
U||   noteworthy stories of his are: The Brick Moon (October, November and
U||   December, 1869, Atlantic Monthly), Life in the Brick Moon (February,
U||   1870, Atlantic Monthly), and Susan’s Escort (May, 1890, Harper’s
U||   Magazine). His chief volumes of short stories are: The Man Without a
U||   Country, and Other Tales (1868); The Brick Moon, and Other Stories
U||   (1873); Crusoe in New York, and Other Tales (1880); and Susan’s Escort,
U||   and Others (1897). The stories by Hale which have made his fame all
U||   show ability of no mean order; but they are characterized by invention
U||   and ingenuity rather than by suffusing imagination. There is not much
U||   homogeneity about Hale’s work. Almost any two stories of his read as if
U||   they might have been written by different authors. For the time being
U||   perhaps this is an advantage—his stories charm by their novelty and
U||   individuality. In the long run, however, this proves rather a handicap.
U||   True individuality, in literature as in the other arts, consists not in
U||   “being different” on different occasions—in different works—so much as
U||   in being samely different from other writers; in being consistently
U||   one’s self, rather than diffusedly various selves. This does not lessen
U||   the value of particular stories, of course. It merely injures Hale’s
U||   fame as a whole. Perhaps some will chiefly feel not so much that his
U||   stories are different among themselves, but that they are not strongly
U||   anything—anybody’s—in particular, that they lack strong personality.
U||   The pathway to fame is strewn with stray exhibitions of talent. Apart
U||   from his purely literary productions, Hale was one of the large moral
U||   forces of his time, through “uplift” both in speech and the written
U||   word.
U||   Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809–1894), one of the leading wits of American
U||   literature, is not at all well known as a short story writer, nor did
U||   he write many brief pieces of fiction. His fame rests chiefly on his
U||   poems and on the Breakfast-Table books (1858-1860-1872-1890). Old
U||   Ironsides, The Last Leaf, The Chambered Nautilus and Homesick in Heaven
U||   are secure of places in the anthologies of the future, while his
U||   lighter verse has made him one of the leading American writers of
U||   “familiar verse.” Frederick Locker-Lampson in the preface to the first
U||   edition of his Lyra Elegantiarum (1867) declared that Holmes was
U||   “perhaps the best living writer of this species of verse.” His
U||   trenchant attack on Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions (1842) makes
U||   us wonder what would have been his attitude toward some of the beliefs
U||   of our own day; Christian Science, for example. He might have “exposed”
U||   it under some such title as The Religio-Medical Masquerade, or brought
U||   the batteries of his humor to bear on it in the manner of Robert Louis
U||   Stevenson’s fable, Something In It: “Perhaps there is not much in it,
U||   as I supposed; but there is something in it after all. Let me be
U||   thankful for that.” In Holmes’ long works of fiction, Elsie Venner
U||   (1861), The Guardian Angel (1867) and A Mortal Antipathy (1885), the
U||   method is still somewhat that of the essayist. I have found a short
U||   piece of fiction by him in the March, 1832, number of The New England
U||   Magazine, called The Début, signed O.W.H. The Story of Iris in The
U||   Professor at the Breakfast Table, which ran in The Atlantic throughout
U||   1859, and A Visit to the Asylum for Aged and Decayed Punsters (January,
U||   1861, Atlantic) are his only other brief fictions of which I am aware.
U||   The last named has been given place in the present selection because it
U||   is characteristic of a certain type and period of American humor,
U||   although its short story qualities are not particularly strong.
U||   Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835–1910), who achieved fame as “Mark
U||   Twain,” is only incidentally a short story writer, although he wrote
U||   many short pieces of fiction. His humorous quality, I mean, is so
U||   preponderant, that one hardly thinks of the form. Indeed, he is never
U||   very strong in fictional construction, and of the modern short story
U||   art he evidently knew or cared little. He is a humorist in the large
U||   sense, as are Rabelais and Cervantes, although he is also a humorist in
U||   various restricted applications of the word that are wholly American.
U||   The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County was his first
U||   publication of importance, and it saw the light in the Nov. 18, 1865,
U||   number of The Saturday Press. It was republished in the collection, The
U||   Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches, in
U||   1867. Others of his best pieces of short fiction are: The Canvasser’s
U||   Tale (December, 1876, Atlantic Monthly), The £1,000,000 Bank Note
U||   (January, 1893, Century Magazine), The Esquimau Maiden’s Romance
U||   (November, 1893, Cosmopolitan), Traveling with a Reformer (December,
U||   1893, Cosmopolitan), The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg (December, 1899,
U||   Harper’s), A Double-Barrelled Detective Story (January and February,
U||   1902, Harper’s) A Dog’s Tale (December, 1903, Harper’s), and Eve’s
U||   Diary (December, 1905, Harper’s). Among Twain’s chief collections of
U||   short stories are: The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and
U||   Other Sketches (1867); The Stolen White Elephant (1882), The £1,000,000
U||   Bank Note (1893), and The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg, and Other
U||   Stories and Sketches (1900).
U||   Harry Stillwell Edwards (1855– ), a native of Georgia, together with
U||   Sarah Barnwell Elliott (? – ) and Will N. Harben (1858–1919) have
U||   continued in the vein of that earlier writer, Augustus Baldwin
U||   Longstreet (1790–1870), author of Georgia Scenes (1835). Edwards’ best
U||   work is to be found in his short stories of black and white life after
U||   the manner of Richard Malcolm Johnston. He has written several novels,
U||   but he is essentially a writer of human-nature sketches. “He is
U||   humorous and picturesque,” says Fred Lewis Pattee, “and often he is for
U||   a moment the master of pathos, but he has added nothing new and nothing
U||   commandingly distinctive.”[4][3] An exception to this might be made in
U||   favor of Elder Brown’s Backslide (August, 1885, Harper’s), a story in
U||   which all the elements are so nicely balanced that the result may well
U||   be called a masterpiece of objective humor and pathos. Others of his
U||   short stories especially worthy of mention are: Two Runaways (July,
U||   1886, Century), Sister Todhunter’s Heart (July, 1887, Century), “De
U||   Valley an’ de Shadder” (January, 1888, Century), An Idyl of “Sinkin’
U||   Mount’in” (October, 1888, Century), The Rival Souls (March, 1889,
U||   Century), The Woodhaven Goat (March, 1899, Century), and The Shadow
U||   (December, 1906, Century). His chief collections are Two Runaways, and
U||   Other Stories (1889) and His Defense, and Other Stories (1898).
U||   The most notable, however, of the group of short story writers of
U||   Georgia life is perhaps Richard Malcolm Johnston (1822–1898). He stands
U||   between Longstreet and the younger writers of Georgia life. His first
U||   book was Georgia Sketches, by an Old Man (1864). The Goose Pond School,
U||   a short story, had been written in 1857; it was not published, however,
U||   till it appeared in the November and December, 1869, numbers of a
U||   Southern magazine, The New Eclectic, over the pseudonym “Philemon
U||   Perch.” His famous Dukesborough Tales (1871–1874) was largely a
U||   republication of the earlier book. Other noteworthy collections of his
U||   are: Mr. Absalom Billingslea and Other Georgia Folk (1888), Mr.
U||   Fortner’s Marital Claims, and Other Stories (1892), and Old Times in
U||   Middle Georgia (1897). Among individual stories stand out: The
U||   Organ-Grinder (July, 1870, New Eclectic), Mr. Neelus Peeler’s
U||   Conditions (June, 1879, Scribner’s Monthly), The Brief Embarrassment of
U||   Mr. Iverson Blount (September, 1884, Century); The Hotel Experience of
U||   Mr. Pink Fluker (June, 1886, Century), republished in the present
U||   collection; The Wimpy Adoptions (February, 1887, Century), The
U||   Experiments of Miss Sally Cash (September, 1888, Century), and Our
U||   Witch (March, 1897, Century). Johnston must be ranked almost with Bret
U||   Harte as a pioneer in “local color” work, although his work had little
U||   recognition until his Dukesborough Tales were republished by Harper &
U||   Brothers in 1883.
U||   Bret Harte (1839–1902) is mentioned here owing to the late date of his
U||   story included in this volume, Colonel Starbottle for the Plaintiff
U||   (March, 1901, Harper’s), although his work as a whole of course belongs
U||   to an earlier period of our literature. It is now well-thumbed literary
U||   history that The Luck of Roaring Camp (August, 1868, Overland) and The
U||   Outcasts of Poker Flat (January, 1869, Overland) brought him a
U||   popularity that, in its suddenness and extent, had no precedent in
U||   American literature save in the case of Mrs. Stowe and Uncle Tom’s
U||   Cabin. According to Harte’s own statement, made in the retrospect of
U||   later years, he set out deliberately to add a new province to American
U||   literature. Although his work has been belittled because he has chosen
U||   exceptional and theatric happenings, yet his real strength came from
U||   his contact with Western life.
U||   Irving and Dickens and other models served only to teach him his art.
U||   “Finally,” says Prof. Pattee, “Harte was the parent of the modern form
U||   of the short story. It was he who started Kipling and Cable and Thomas
U||   Nelson Page. Few indeed have surpassed him in the mechanics of this
U||   most difficult of arts. According to his own belief, the form is an
U||   American product ... Harte has described the genesis of his own art. It
U||   sprang from the Western humor and was developed by the circumstances
U||   that surrounded him. Many of his short stories are models. They contain
U||   not a superfluous word, they handle a single incident with grapic
U||   power, they close without moral or comment. The form came as a natural
U||   evolution from his limitations and powers. With him the story must of
U||   necessity be brief.... Bret Harte was the artist of impulse, the
U||   painter of single burning moments, the flashlight photographer who
U||   caught in lurid detail one dramatic episode in the life of a man or a
U||   community and left the rest in darkness.”[5][4]
U||   Harte’s humor is mostly “Western humor” There is not always uproarious
U||   merriment, but there is a constant background of humor. I know of no
U||   more amusing scene in American literature than that in the courtroom
U||   when the Colonel gives his version of the deacon’s method of signaling
U||   to the widow in Harte’s story included in the present volume, Colonel
U||   Starbottle for the Plaintiff. Here is part of it:
U||   True to the instructions she had received from him, her lips part in
U||   the musical utterance (the Colonel lowered his voice in a faint
U||   falsetto, presumably in fond imitation of his fair client) “Kerree!”
U||   Instantly the night becomes resonant with the impassioned reply (the
U||   Colonel here lifted his voice in stentorian tones), “Kerrow!” Again, as
U||   he passes, rises the soft “Kerree!”; again, as his form is lost in the
U||   distance, comes back the deep “Kerrow!”
U||   While Harte’s stories all have in them a certain element or background
U||   of humor, yet perhaps the majority of them are chiefly romantic or
U||   dramatic even more than they are humorous.
U||   Among the best of his short stories may be mentioned: The Luck of
U||   Roaring Camp (August, 1868, Overland), The Outcasts of Poker Flat
U||   (January, 1869, Overland), Tennessee’s Partner (October, 1869,
U||   Overland), Brown of Calaveras (March, 1870, Overland), Flip: a
U||   California Romance (in Flip, and Other Stories, 1882), Left Out on Lone
U||   Star Mountain (January, 1884, Longman’s), An Ingenue of the Sierras
U||   (July, 1894, McClure’s), The Bell-Ringer of Angel’s (in The Bell-Ringer
U||   of Angel’s, and Other Stories, 1894), Chu Chu (in The Bell-Ringer of
U||   Angel’s, and Other Stories, 1894), The Man and the Mountain (in The
U||   Ancestors of Peter Atherly, and Other Tales, 1897), Salomy Jane’s Kiss
U||   (in Stories in Light and Shadow, 1898), The Youngest Miss Piper
U||   (February, 1900, Leslie’s Monthly), Colonel Starbottle for the
U||   Plaintiff (March, 1901, Harper’s), A Mercury of the Foothills (July,
U||   1901, Cosmopolitan), Lanty Foster’s Mistake (December, 1901, New
U||   England), An Ali Baba of the Sierras (January 4, 1902, Saturday Evening
U||   Post), and Dick Boyle’s Business Card (in Trent’s Trust, and Other
U||   Stories, 1903). Among his notable collections of stories are: The Luck
U||   of Roaring Camp, and Other Sketches (1870), Flip, and Other Stories
U||   (1882), On the Frontier (1884), Colonel Starbottle’s Client, and Some
U||   Other People (1892), A Protégé of Jack Hamlin’s, and Other Stories
U||   (1894), The Bell-Ringer of Angel’s, and Other Stories (1894), The
U||   Ancestors of Peter Atherly, and Other Tales (1897), Openings in the Old
U||   Trail (1902), and Trent’s Trust, and Other Stories (1903). The titles
U||   and makeup of several of his collections were changed when they came to
U||   be arranged in the complete edition of his works.[6][5]
U||   Henry Cuyler Bunner (1855–1896) is one of the humorous geniuses of
U||   American literature. He is equally at home in clever verse or the brief
U||   short story. Prof. Fred Lewis Pattee has summed up his achievement as
U||   follows: “Another [than Stockton] who did much to advance the short
U||   story toward the mechanical perfection it had attained to at the close
U||   of the century was Henry Cuyler Bunner, editor of Puck and creator of
U||   some of the most exquisite vers de société of the period. The title of
U||   one of his collections, Made in France: French Tales Retold with a U.S.
U||   Twist (1893), forms an introduction to his fiction. Not that he was an
U||   imitator; few have been more original or have put more of their own
U||   personality into their work. His genius was Gallic. Like Aldrich, he
U||   approached the short story from the fastidious standpoint of the lyric
U||   poet. With him, as with Aldrich, art was a matter of exquisite touches,
U||   of infinite compression, of almost imperceptible shadings. The lurid
U||   splashes and the heavy emphasis of the local colorists offended his
U||   sensitive taste: he would work with suggestion, with microscopic
U||   focussings, and always with dignity and elegance. He was more American
U||   than Henry James, more even than Aldrich. He chose always distinctively
U||   American subjects—New York City was his favorite theme—and his work had
U||   more depth of soul than Stockton’s or Aldrich’s. The story may be
U||   trivial, a mere expanded anecdote, yet it is sure to be so vitally
U||   treated that, like Maupassant’s work, it grips and remains, and, what
U||   is more, it lifts and chastens or explains. It may be said with
U||   assurance that Short Sixes marks one of the high places which have been
U||   attained by the American short story.”[7][6]
U||   Among Bunner’s best stories are: Love in Old Cloathes (September, 1883,
U||   Century), A Successful Failure (July, 1887, Puck), The Love-Letters of
U||   Smith (July 23, 1890, Puck) The Nice People (July 30, 1890, Puck), The
U||   Nine Cent-Girls (August 13, 1890, Puck), The Two Churches of ’Quawket
U||   (August 27, 1890, Puck), A Round-Up (September 10, 1890, Puck), A
U||   Sisterly Scheme (September 24, 1890, Puck), Our Aromatic Uncle (August,
U||   1895, Scribner’s), The Time-Table Test (in The Suburban Sage, 1896). He
U||   collaborated with Prof. Brander Matthews in several stories, notably in
U||   The Documents in the Case (Sept., 1879, Scribner’s Monthly). His best
U||   collections are: Short Sixes: Stories to be Read While the Candle Burns
U||   (1891), More Short Sixes (1894), and Love in Old Cloathes, and Other
U||   Stories (1896).
U||   After Poe and Hawthorne almost the first author in America to make a
U||   vertiginous impression by his short stories was Bret Harte. The wide
U||   and sudden popularity he attained by the publication of his two short
U||   stories, The Luck of Roaring Camp (1868) and The Outcasts of Poker Flat
U||   (1869), has already been noted.[8][7] But one story just before Harte
U||   that astonished the fiction audience with its power and art was Harriet
U||   Prescott Spofford’s (1835– ) The Amber Gods (January and February,
U||   1860, Atlantic), with its startling ending, “I must have died at ten
U||   minutes past one.” After Harte the next story to make a great sensation
U||   was Thomas Bailey Aldrich’s Marjorie Daw (April, 1873, Atlantic), a
U||   story with a surprise at the end, as had been his A Struggle for Life
U||   (July, 1867, Atlantic), although it was only Marjorie Daw that
U||   attracted much attention at the time. Then came George Washington
U||   Cable’s (1844– ) “Posson Jone’,” (April 1, 1876, Appleton’s Journal)
U||   and a little later Charles Egbert Craddock’s (1850– ) The Dancin’ Party
U||   at Harrison’s Cove (May, 1878, Atlantic) and The Star in the Valley
U||   (November, 1878, Atlantic). But the work of Cable and Craddock, though
U||   of sterling worth, won its way gradually. Even Edward Everett Hale’s
U||   (1822–1909) My Double; and How He Undid Me (September, 1859, Atlantic)
U||   and The Man Without a Country (December, 1863, Atlantic) had fallen
U||   comparatively still-born. The truly astounding short story successes,
U||   after Poe and Hawthorne, then, were Spofford, Bret Harte and Aldrich.
U||   Next came Frank Richard Stockton (1834–1902). “The interest created by
U||   the appearance of Marjorie Daw,” says Prof. Pattee, “was mild compared
U||   with that accorded to Frank R. Stockton’s The Lady or the Tiger?
U||   (1884). Stockton had not the technique of Aldrich nor his naturalness
U||   and ease. Certainly he had not his atmosphere of the beau monde and his
U||   grace of style, but in whimsicality and unexpectedness and in that
U||   subtle art that makes the obviously impossible seem perfectly plausible
U||   and commonplace he surpassed not only him but Edward Everett Hale and
U||   all others. After Stockton and The Lady or the Tiger? it was realized
U||   even by the uncritical that short story writing had become a subtle art
U||   and that the master of its subtleties had his reader at his
U||   mercy.”[9][8] The publication of Stockton’s short stories covers a
U||   period of over forty years, from Mahala’s Drive (November, 1868,
U||   Lippincott’s) to The Trouble She Caused When She Kissed (December,
U||   1911, Ladies’ Home Journal), published nine years after his death.
U||   Among the more notable of his stories may be mentioned: The Transferred
U||   Ghost (May, 1882, Century), The Lady or the Tiger? (November, 1882,
U||   Century), The Reversible Landscape (July, 1884, Century), The
U||   Remarkable Wreck of the “Thomas Hyke” (August, 1884, Century), “His
U||   Wife’s Deceased Sister” (January, 1884, Century), A Tale of Negative
U||   Gravity (December, 1884, Century), The Christmas Wreck (in The
U||   Christmas Wreck, and Other Stories, 1886), Amos Kilbright (in Amos
U||   Kilbright, His Adscititious Experiences, with Other Stories, 1888),
U||   Asaph (May, 1892, Cosmopolitan), My Terminal Moraine (April 26, 1892,
U||   Collier’s Once a Week Library), The Magic Egg (June, 1894, Century),
U||   The Buller-Podington Compact (August, 1897, Scribner’s), and The
U||   Widow’s Cruise (in A Story-Teller’s Pack, 1897). Most of his best work
U||   was gathered into the collections: The Lady or the Tiger?, and Other
U||   Stories (1884), The Bee-Man of Orn, and Other Fanciful Tales (1887),
U||   Amos Kilbright, His Adscititious Experiences, with Other Stories
U||   (1888), The Clocks of Rondaine, and Other Stories (1892), A Chosen Few
U||   (1895), A Story-Teller’s Pack (1897), and The Queen’s Museum, and Other
U||   Fanciful Tales (1906).
U||   After Stockton and Bunner come O. Henry (1862–1910) and Jack London
U||   (1876–1916), apostles of the burly and vigorous in fiction. Beside or
U||   above them stand Henry James (1843–1916)—although he belongs to an
U||   earlier period as well—Edith Wharton (1862– ), Alice Brown (1857– ),
U||   Margaret Wade Deland (1857– ), and Katharine Fullerton Gerould (1879–
U||   ), practitioners in all that O. Henry and London are not, of the finer
U||   fields, the more subtle nuances of modern life. With O. Henry and
U||   London, though perhaps less noteworthy, are to be grouped George
U||   Randolph Chester (1869– ) and Irvin Shrewsbury Cobb (1876– ). Then,
U||   standing rather each by himself, are Melville Davisson Post (1871– ), a
U||   master of psychological mystery stories, and Wilbur Daniel Steele
U||   (1886– ), whose work it is hard to classify. These ten names represent
U||   much that is best in American short story production since the
U||   beginning of the twentieth century (1900). Not all are notable for
U||   humor; but inasmuch as any consideration of the American humorous short
U||   story cannot be wholly dissociated from a consideration of the American
U||   short story in general, it has seemed not amiss to mention these
U||   authors here. Although Sarah Orne Jewett (1849–1909) lived on into the
U||   twentieth century and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman (1862– ) is still with
U||   us, the best and most typical work of these two writers belongs in the
U||   last two decades of the previous century. To an earlier period also
U||   belong Charles Egbert Craddock (1850– ), George Washington Cable (1844–
U||   ), Thomas Nelson Page (1853– ), Constance Fenimore Woolson (1848–1894),
U||   Harriet Prescott Spofford (1835– ), Hamlin Garland (1860– ), Ambrose
U||   Bierce (1842–?), Rose Terry Cooke (1827–1892), and Kate Chopin
U||   (1851–1904).
U||   “O. Henry” was the pen name adopted by William Sydney Porter. He began
U||   his short story career by contributing Whistling Dick’s Christmas
U||   Stocking to McClure’s Magazine in 1899. He followed it with many
U||   stories dealing with Western and South- and Central-American life, and
U||   later came most of his stories of the life of New York City, in which
U||   field lies most of his best work. He contributed more stories to the
U||   New York World than to any other one publication—as if the stories of
U||   the author who later came to be hailed as “the American Maupassant”
U||   were not good enough for the “leading” magazines but fit only for the
U||   sensation-loving public of the Sunday papers! His first published story
U||   that showed distinct strength was perhaps A Blackjack Bargainer
U||   (August, 1901, Munsey’s). He followed this with such masterly stories
U||   as: The Duplicity of Hargraves (February, 1902, Junior Munsey), The
U||   Marionettes (April, 1902, Black Cat), A Retrieved Reformation (April,
U||   1903, Cosmopolitan), The Guardian of the Accolade (May, 1903,
U||   Cosmopolitan), The Enchanted Kiss (February, 1904, Metropolitan), The
U||   Furnished Room (August 14, 1904, New York World), An Unfinished Story
U||   (August, 1905, McClure’s), The Count and the Wedding Guest (October 8,
U||   1905, New York World), The Gift of the Magi (December 10, 1905, New
U||   York World), The Trimmed Lamp (August, 1906, McClure’s), Phoebe
U||   (November, 1907, Everybody’s), The Hiding of Black Bill (October, 1908,
U||   Everybody’s), No Story (June, 1909, Metropolitan), A Municipal Report
U||   (November, 1909, Hampton’s), A Service of Love (in The Four Million,
U||   1909), The Pendulum (in The Trimmed Lamp, 1910), Brickdust Row (in The
U||   Trimmed Lamp, 1910), and The Assessor of Success (in The Trimmed Lamp,
U||   1910). Among O. Henry’s best volumes of short stories are: The Four
U||   Million (1909), Options (1909), Roads of Destiny (1909), The Trimmed
U||   Lamp (1910), Strictly Business: More Stories of the Four Million
U||   (1910), Whirligigs (1910), and Sixes and Sevens (1911).
U||   “Nowhere is there anything just like them. In his best work—and his
U||   tales of the great metropolis are his best—he is unique. The soul of
U||   his art is unexpectedness. Humor at every turn there is, and sentiment
U||   and philosophy and surprise. One never may be sure of himself. The end
U||   is always a sensation. No foresight may predict it, and the sensation
U||   always is genuine. Whatever else O. Henry was, he was an artist, a
U||   master of plot and diction, a genuine humorist, and a philosopher. His
U||   weakness lay in the very nature of his art. He was an entertainer bent
U||   only on amusing and surprising his reader. Everywhere brilliancy, but
U||   too often it is joined to cheapness; art, yet art merging swiftly into
U||   caricature. Like Harte, he cannot be trusted. Both writers on the whole
U||   may be said to have lowered the standards of American literature, since
U||   both worked in the surface of life with theatric intent and always
U||   without moral background, O. Henry moves, but he never lifts. All is
U||   fortissimo; he slaps the reader on the back and laughs loudly as if he
U||   were in a bar-room. His characters, with few exceptions, are extremes,
U||   caricatures. Even his shop girls, in the limning of whom he did his
U||   best work, are not really individuals; rather are they types, symbols.
U||   His work was literary vaudeville, brilliant, highly amusing, and yet
U||   vaudeville.”[10][9] The Duplicity of Hargraves, the story by O. Henry
U||   given in this volume, is free from most of his defects. It has a blend
U||   of humor and pathos that puts it on a plane of universal appeal.
U||   George Randolph Chester (1869– ) gained distinction by creating the
U||   genial modern business man of American literature who is not content to
U||   “get rich quick” through the ordinary channels. Need I say that I refer
U||   to that amazing compound of likeableness and sharp practices,
U||   Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford? The story of his included in this volume,
U||   Bargain Day at Tutt House (June, 1905, McClure’s), was nearly his first
U||   story; only two others, which came out in The Saturday Evening Post in
U||   1903 and 1904, preceded it. Its breathless dramatic action is well
U||   balanced by humor. Other stories of his deserving of special mention
U||   are: A Corner in Farmers (February, 29, 1908, Saturday Evening Post), A
U||   Fortune in Smoke (March 14, 1908, Saturday Evening Post), Easy Money
U||   (November 14, 1908, Saturday Evening Post), The Triple Cross (December
U||   5, 1908, Saturday Evening Post), Spoiling the Egyptians (December 26,
U||   1908, Saturday Evening Post), Whipsawed! (January 16, 1909, Saturday
U||   Evening Post), The Bubble Bank (January 30 and February 6, 1909,
U||   Saturday Evening Post), Straight Business (February 27, 1909, Saturday
U||   Evening Post), Sam Turner: a Business Man’s Love Story (March 26, April
U||   2 and 9, 1910, Saturday Evening Post), Fundamental Justice (July 25,
U||   1914, Saturday Evening Post), A Scropper Patcher (October, 1916,
U||   Everybody’s), and Jolly Bachelors (February, 1918, Cosmopolitan). His
U||   best collections are: Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford (1908), Young
U||   Wallingford (1910), Wallingford in His Prime (1913), and Wallingford
U||   and Blackie Daw (1913). It is often difficult to find in his books
U||   short stories that one may be looking for, for the reason that the
U||   titles of the individual stories have been removed in order to make the
U||   books look like novels subdivided into chapters.
U||   Grace MacGowan Cooke (1863– ) is a writer all of whose work has
U||   interest and perdurable stuff in it, but few are the authors whose
U||   achievements in the American short story stand out as a whole. In A
U||   Call (August, 1906, Harper’s) she surpasses herself and is not perhaps
U||   herself surpassed by any of the humorous short stories that have come
U||   to the fore so far in America in the twentieth century. The story is no
U||   less delightful in its fidelity to fact and understanding of young
U||   human nature than in its relish of humor. Some of her stories deserving
U||   of special mention are: The Capture of Andy Proudfoot (June, 1904,
U||   Harper’s), In the Strength of the Hills (December, 1905, Metropolitan),
U||   The Machinations of Ocoee Gallantine (April, 1906, Century), A Call
U||   (August, 1906, Harper’s), Scott Bohannon’s Bond (May 4, 1907,
U||   Collier’s), and A Clean Shave (November, 1912, Century). Her best short
U||   stories do not seem to have been collected in volumes as yet, although
U||   she has had several notable long works of fiction published, such as
U||   The Power and the Glory (1910), and several good juveniles.
U||   William James Lampton (?–1917), who was known to many of his admirers
U||   as Will Lampton or as W.J.L. merely, was one of the most unique and
U||   interesting characters of literary and Bohemian New York from about
U||   1895 to his death in 1917. I remember walking up Fifth Avenue with him
U||   one Sunday afternoon just after he had shown me a letter from the man
U||   who was then Comptroller of the Currency. The letter was signed so
U||   illegibly that my companion was in doubts as to the sender, so he
U||   suggested that we stop at a well-known hotel at the corner of 59th
U||   Street, and ask the manager who the Comptroller of the Currency then
U||   was, so that he might know whom the letter was from. He said that the
U||   manager of a big hotel like that, where many prominent people stayed,
U||   would be sure to know. When this problem had been solved to our
U||   satisfaction, John Skelton Williams proving to be the man, Lampton
U||   said, “Now you’ve told me who he is, I’ll show you who I am.” So he
U||   asked for a copy of The American Magazine at a newsstand in the hotel
U||   corridor, opened it, and showed the manager a full-page picture of
U||   himself clad in a costume suggestive of the time of Christopher
U||   Columbus, with high ruffs around his neck, that happened to appear in
U||   the magazine the current month. I mention this incident to illustrate
U||   the lack of conventionality and whimsical originality of the man, that
U||   stood out no less forcibly in his writings than in his daily life. He
U||   had little use for “doing the usual thing in the usual sort of way.” He
U||   first gained prominence by his book of verse, Yawps (1900). His poems
U||   were free from convention in technique as well as in spirit, although
U||   their chief innovation was simply that as a rule there was no regular
U||   number of syllables in a line; he let the lines be any length they
U||   wanted to be, to fit the sense or the length of what he had to say. He
U||   once said to me that if anything of his was remembered he thought it
U||   would be his poem, Lo, the Summer Girl. His muse often took the
U||   direction of satire, but it was always good-natured even when it hit
U||   the hardest. He had in his makeup much of the detached philosopher,
U||   like Cervantes and Mark Twain.
U||   There was something cosmic about his attitude to life, and this showed
U||   in much that he did. He was the only American writer of humorous verse
U||   of his day whom I always cared to read, or whose lines I could remember
U||   more than a few weeks. This was perhaps because his work was never
U||   merely humorous, but always had a big sweep of background to it, like
U||   the ruggedness of the Kentucky mountains from which he came. It was
U||   Colonel George Harvey, then editor of Harper’s Weekly, who had started
U||   the boom to make Woodrow Wilson President. Wilson afterwards, at least
U||   seemingly, repudiated his sponsor, probably because of Harvey’s
U||   identification with various moneyed interests. Lampton’s poem on the
U||   subject, with its refrain, “Never again, said Colonel George,” I
U||   remember as one of the most notable of his poems on current topics. But
U||   what always seemed to me the best of his poems dealing with matters of
U||   the hour was one that I suggested he write, which dealt with
U||   gift-giving to the public, at about the time that Andrew Carnegie was
U||   making a big stir with his gifts for libraries, beginning:
U||   Dunno, perhaps
U||   One of the yaps
U||   Like me would make
U||   A holy break
U||   Doing his turn
U||   With money to burn.
U||   Anyhow, I
U||   Wouldn’t shy
U||   Making a try!
U||   and containing, among many effective touches, the pathetic lines,
U||   . . . I’d help
U||   The poor who try to help themselves,
U||   Who have to work so hard for bread
U||   They can’t get very far ahead.
U||   When James Lane Allen’s novel, The Reign of Law, came out (1900), a
U||   little quatrain by Lampton that appeared in The Bookman (September,
U||   1900) swept like wildfire across the country, and was read by a hundred
U||   times as many people as the book itself:
U||   “The Reign of Law”?
U||   Well, Allen, you’re lucky;
U||   It’s the first time it ever
U||   Rained law in Kentucky!
U||   The reader need not be reminded that at that period Kentucky family
U||   feuds were well to the fore. As Lampton had started as a poet, the
U||   editors were bound to keep him pigeon-holed as far as they could, and
U||   his ambition to write short stories was not at first much encouraged by
U||   them. His predicament was something like that of the chief character of
U||   Frank R. Stockton’s story, “His Wife’s Deceased Sister” (January, 1884,
U||   Century), who had written a story so good that whenever he brought the
U||   editors another story they invariably answered in substance, “We’re
U||   afraid it won’t do. Can’t you give us something like ‘His Wife’s
U||   Deceased Sister’?” This was merely Stockton’s turning to account his
U||   own somewhat similar experience with the editors after his story, The
U||   Lady or the Tiger? (November, 1882, Century) appeared. Likewise the
U||   editors didn’t want Lampton’s short stories for a while because they
U||   liked his poems so well.
U||   Do I hear some critics exclaiming that there is nothing remarkable
U||   about How the Widow Won the Deacon, the story by Lampton included in
U||   this volume? It handles an amusing situation lightly and with grace. It
U||   is one of those things that read easily and are often difficult to
U||   achieve. Among his best stories are: The People’s Number of the
U||   Worthyville Watchman (May 12, 1900, Saturday Evening Post), Love’s
U||   Strange Spell (April 27, 1901, Saturday Evening Post), Abimelech
U||   Higgins’ Way (August 24, 1001, Saturday Evening Post), A Cup of Tea
U||   (March, 1902, Metropolitan), Winning His Spurs (May, 1904,
U||   Cosmopolitan), The Perfidy of Major Pulsifer (November, 1909,
U||   Cosmopolitan), How the Widow Won the Deacon (April, 1911, Harper’s
U||   Bazaar), and A Brown Study (December, 1913, Lippincott’s). There is no
U||   collection as yet of his short stories. Although familiarly known as
U||   “Colonel” Lampton, and although of Kentucky, he was not merely a
U||   “Kentucky Colonel,” for he was actually appointed Colonel on the staff
U||   of the governor of Kentucky. At the time of his death he was about to
U||   be made a brigadier-general and was planning to raise a brigade of
U||   Kentucky mountaineers for service in the Great War. As he had just
U||   struck his stride in short story writing, the loss to literature was
U||   even greater than the patriotic loss.
U||   Gideon (April, 1914, Century), by Wells Hastings (1878– ), the story
U||   with which this volume closes, calls to mind the large number of
U||   notable short stories in American literature by writers who have made
U||   no large name for themselves as short story writers, or even otherwise
U||   in letters. American literature has always been strong in its “stray”
U||   short stories of note. In Mr. Hastings’ case, however, I feel that the
U||   fame is sure to come. He graduated from Yale in 1902, collaborated with
U||   Brian Hooker (1880- ) in a novel, The Professor’s Mystery (1911) and
U||   alone wrote another novel, The Man in the Brown Derby (1911). His short
U||   stories include: The New Little Boy (July, 1911, American), That Day
U||   (September, 1911, American), The Pick-Up (December, 1911, Everybody’s),
U||   and Gideon (April, 1914, Century). The last story stands out. It can be
U||   compared without disadvantage to the best work, or all but the very
U||   best work, of Thomas Nelson Page, it seems to me. And from the reader’s
U||   standpoint it has the advantage—is this not also an author’s
U||   advantage?—of a more modern setting and treatment. Mr. Hastings is, I
U||   have been told, a director in over a dozen large corporations. Let us
U||   hope that his business activities will not keep him too much away from
U||   the production of literature—for to rank as a piece of literature,
U||   something of permanent literary value, Gideon is surely entitled.

U||THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN AND HIS WATER LOTS[39][10]
U||   By George Pope Morris (1802–1864)
U||   Look into those they call unfortunate,
U||   And, closer view’d, you’ll find they are unwise.—Young.
U||   Let wealth come in by comely thrift,
U||   And not by any foolish shift:
U||   ’Tis haste
U||   Makes waste:
U||   Who gripes too hard the dry and slippery sand
U||   Holds none at all, or little, in his hand.—Herrick.
U||   Let well alone.—Proverb.
U||   How much real comfort every one might enjoy if he would be contented
U||   with the lot in which heaven has cast him, and how much trouble would
U||   be avoided if people would only “let well alone.” A moderate
U||   independence, quietly and honestly procured, is certainly every way
U||   preferable even to immense possessions achieved by the wear and tear of
U||   mind and body so necessary to procure them. Yet there are very few
U||   individuals, let them be doing ever so well in the world, who are not
U||   always straining every nerve to do better; and this is one of the many
U||   causes why failures in business so frequently occur among us. The
U||   present generation seem unwilling to “realize” by slow and sure
U||   degrees; but choose rather to set their whole hopes upon a single cast,
U||   which either makes or mars them forever!
U||   Gentle reader, do you remember Monsieur Poopoo? He used to keep a small
U||   toy-store in Chatham, near the corner of Pearl Street. You must
U||   recollect him, of course. He lived there for many years, and was one of
U||   the most polite and accommodating of shopkeepers. When a juvenile, you
U||   have bought tops and marbles of him a thousand times. To be sure you
U||   have; and seen his vinegar-visage lighted up with a smile as you flung
U||   him the coppers; and you have laughed at his little straight queue and
U||   his dimity breeches, and all the other oddities that made up the
U||   everyday apparel of my little Frenchman. Ah, I perceive you recollect
U||   him now.
U||   Well, then, there lived Monsieur Poopoo ever since he came from “dear,
U||   delightful Paris,” as he was wont to call the city of his
U||   nativity—there he took in the pennies for his kickshaws—there he laid
U||   aside five thousand dollars against a rainy day—there he was as happy
U||   as a lark—and there, in all human probability, he would have been to
U||   this very day, a respected and substantial citizen, had he been willing
U||   to “let well alone.” But Monsieur Poopoo had heard strange stories
U||   about the prodigious rise in real estate; and, having understood that
U||   most of his neighbors had become suddenly rich by speculating in lots,
U||   he instantly grew dissatisfied with his own lot, forthwith determined
U||   to shut up shop, turn everything into cash, and set about making money
U||   in right-down earnest. No sooner said than done; and our quondam
U||   storekeeper a few days afterward attended an extensive sale of real
U||   estate, at the Merchants’ Exchange.
U||   There was the auctioneer, with his beautiful and inviting lithographic
U||   maps—all the lots as smooth and square and enticingly laid out as
U||   possible—and there were the speculators—and there, in the midst of
U||   them, stood Monsieur Poopoo.
U||   “Here they are, gentlemen,” said he of the hammer, “the most valuable
U||   lots ever offered for sale. Give me a bid for them!”
U||   “One hundred each,” said a bystander.
U||   “One hundred!” said the auctioneer, “scarcely enough to pay for the
U||   maps. One hundred—going—and fifty—gone! Mr. H., they are yours. A noble
U||   purchase. You’ll sell those same lots in less than a fortnight for
U||   fifty thousand dollars profit!”
U||   Monsieur Poopoo pricked up his ears at this, and was lost in
U||   astonishment. This was a much easier way certainly of accumulating
U||   riches than selling toys in Chatham Street, and he determined to buy
U||   and mend his fortune without delay.
U||   The auctioneer proceeded in his sale. Other parcels were offered and
U||   disposed of, and all the purchasers were promised immense advantages
U||   for their enterprise. At last came a more valuable parcel than all the
U||   rest. The company pressed around the stand, and Monsieur Poopoo did the
U||   same.
U||   “I now offer you, gentlemen, these magnificent lots, delightfully
U||   situated on Long Island, with valuable water privileges. Property in
U||   fee—title indisputable—terms of sale, cash—deeds ready for delivery
U||   immediately after the sale. How much for them? Give them a start at
U||   something. How much?” The auctioneer looked around; there were no
U||   bidders. At last he caught the eye of Monsieur Poopoo. “Did you say one
U||   hundred, sir? Beautiful lots—valuable water privileges—shall I say one
U||   hundred for you?”
U||   “Oui, monsieur; I will give you von hundred dollar apiece, for de lot
U||   vid de valuarble vatare privalege; c’est ça.”
U||   “Only one hundred apiece for these sixty valuable lots—only one
U||   hundred—going—going—going—gone!”
U||   Monsieur Poopoo was the fortunate possessor. The auctioneer
U||   congratulated him—the sale closed—and the company dispersed.
U||   “Pardonnez-moi, monsieur,” said Poopoo, as the auctioneer descended his
U||   pedestal, “you shall excusez-moi, if I shall go to votre bureau, your
U||   counting-house, ver quick to make every ting sure wid respec to de lot
U||   vid de valuarble vatare privalege. Von leetle bird in de hand he vorth
U||   two in de tree, c’est vrai—eh?”
U||   “Certainly, sir.”
U||   “Vell den, allons.”
U||   And the gentlemen repaired to the counting-house, where the six
U||   thousand dollars were paid, and the deeds of the property delivered.
U||   Monsieur Poopoo put these carefully in his pocket, and as he was about
U||   taking his leave, the auctioneer made him a present of the lithographic
U||   outline of the lots, which was a very liberal thing on his part,
U||   considering the map was a beautiful specimen of that glorious art.
U||   Poopoo could not admire it sufficiently. There were his sixty lots, as
U||   uniform as possible, and his little gray eyes sparkled like diamonds as
U||   they wandered from one end of the spacious sheet to the other.
U||   Poopoo’s heart was as light as a feather, and he snapped his fingers in
U||   the very wantonness of joy as he repaired to Delmonico’s, and ordered
U||   the first good French dinner that had gladdened his palate since his
U||   arrival in America.
U||   After having discussed his repast, and washed it down with a bottle of
U||   choice old claret, he resolved upon a visit to Long Island to view his
U||   purchase. He consequently immediately hired a horse and gig, crossed
U||   the Brooklyn ferry, and drove along the margin of the river to the
U||   Wallabout, the location in question.
U||   Our friend, however, was not a little perplexed to find his property.
U||   Everything on the map was as fair and even as possible, while all the
U||   grounds about him were as undulated as they could well be imagined, and
U||   there was an elbow of the East River thrusting itself quite into the
U||   ribs of the land, which seemed to have no business there. This puzzled
U||   the Frenchman exceedingly; and, being a stranger in those parts, he
U||   called to a farmer in an adjacent field.
U||   “Mon ami, are you acquaint vid dis part of de country—eh?”
U||   “Yes, I was born here, and know every inch of it.”
U||   “Ah, c’est bien, dat vill do,” and the Frenchman got out of the gig,
U||   tied the horse, and produced his lithographic map.
U||   “Den maybe you vill have de kindness to show me de sixty lot vich I
U||   have bought, vid de valuarble vatare privalege?”
U||   The farmer glanced his eye over the paper.
U||   “Yes, sir, with pleasure; if you will be good enough to get into my
U||   boat, I will row you out to them!”
U||   “Vat dat you say, sure?”
U||   “My friend,” said the farmer, “this section of Long Island has recently
U||   been bought up by the speculators of New York, and laid out for a great
U||   city; but the principal street is only visible at low tide. When this
U||   part of the East River is filled up, it will be just there. Your lots,
U||   as you will perceive, are beyond it; and are now all under water.”
U||   At first the Frenchman was incredulous. He could not believe his
U||   senses. As the facts, however, gradually broke upon him, he shut one
U||   eye, squinted obliquely at the heavens—-the river—the farmer—and then
U||   he turned away and squinted at them all over again! There was his
U||   purchase sure enough; but then it could not be perceived for there was
U||   a river flowing over it! He drew a box from his waistcoat pocket,
U||   opened it, with an emphatic knock upon the lid, took a pinch of snuff
U||   and restored it to his waistcoat pocket as before. Poopoo was evidently
U||   in trouble, having “thoughts which often lie too deep for tears”; and,
U||   as his grief was also too big for words, he untied his horse, jumped
U||   into his gig, and returned to the auctioneer in hot haste.
U||   It was near night when he arrived at the auction-room—his horse in a
U||   foam and himself in a fury. The auctioneer was leaning back in his
U||   chair, with his legs stuck out of a low window, quietly smoking a cigar
U||   after the labors of the day, and humming the music from the last new
U||   opera.
U||   “Monsieur, I have much plaisir to fin’ you, chez vous, at home.”
U||   “Ah, Poopoo! glad to see you. Take a seat, old boy.”
U||   “But I shall not take de seat, sare.”
U||   “No—why, what’s the matter?”
U||   “Oh, beaucoup de matter. I have been to see de gran lot vot you sell me
U||   to-day.”
U||   “Well, sir, I hope you like your purchase?”
U||   “No, monsieur, I no like him.”
U||   “I’m sorry for it; but there is no ground for your complaint.”
U||   “No, sare; dare is no ground at all—de ground is all vatare!”
U||   “You joke!”
U||   “I no joke. I nevare joke; je n’entends pas la raillerie, Sare,
U||   voulez-vous have de kindness to give me back de money vot I pay!”
U||   “Certainly not.”
U||   “Den vill you be so good as to take de East River off de top of my
U||   lot?”
U||   “That’s your business, sir, not mine.”
U||   “Den I make von mauvaise affaire—von gran mistake!”
U||   “I hope not. I don’t think you have thrown your money away in the
U||   land.”
U||   “No, sare; but I tro it avay in de vatare!”
U||   “That’s not my fault.”
U||   “Yes, sare, but it is your fault. You’re von ver gran rascal to swindle
U||   me out of de l’argent.”
U||   “Hello, old Poopoo, you grow personal; and if you can’t keep a civil
U||   tongue in your head, you must go out of my counting-room.”
U||   “Vare shall I go to, eh?”
U||   “To the devil, for aught I care, you foolish old Frenchman!” said the
U||   auctioneer, waxing warm.
U||   “But, sare, I vill not go to de devil to oblige you!” replied the
U||   Frenchman, waxing warmer. “You sheat me out of all de dollar vot I make
U||   in Shatham Street; but I vill not go to de devil for all dat. I vish
U||   you may go to de devil yourself you dem yankee-doo-dell, and I vill go
U||   and drown myself, tout de suite, right avay.”
U||   “You couldn’t make a better use of your water privileges, old boy!”
U||   “Ah, miséricorde! Ah, mon dieu, je suis abîmé. I am ruin! I am done up!
U||   I am break all into ten sousan leetle pieces! I am von lame duck, and I
U||   shall vaddle across de gran ocean for Paris, vish is de only valuarble
U||   vatare privalege dat is left me à present!”
U||   Poor Poopoo was as good as his word. He sailed in the next packet, and
U||   arrived in Paris almost as penniless as the day he left it.
U||   Should any one feel disposed to doubt the veritable circumstances here
U||   recorded, let him cross the East River to the Wallabout, and farmer J——
U||   will row him out to the very place where the poor Frenchman’s lots
U||   still remain under water.

U||THE ANGEL OF THE ODD[41][11]
U||   By Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849)
U||   It was a chilly November afternoon. I had just consummated an unusually
U||   hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic truffe formed not the least
U||   important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room with my feet
U||   upon the fender and at my elbow a small table which I had rolled up to
U||   the fire, and upon which were some apologies for dessert, with some
U||   miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit, and liqueur. In the morning I
U||   had been reading Glover’s Leonidas, Wilkie’s Epigoniad, Lamartine’s
U||   Pilgrimage, Barlow’s Columbiad, Tuckerman’s Sicily, and Griswold’s
U||   Curiosities, I am willing to confess, therefore, that I now felt a
U||   little stupid. I made effort to arouse myself by frequent aid of
U||   Lafitte, and all failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper in
U||   despair. Having carefully perused the column of “Houses to let,” and
U||   the column of “Dogs lost,” and then the columns of “Wives and
U||   apprentices runaway,” I attacked with great resolution the editorial
U||   matter, and reading it from beginning to end without understanding a
U||   syllable, conceived the possibility of its being Chinese, and so
U||   re-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no more satisfactory
U||   result. I was about throwing away in disgust
U||   This folio of four pages, happy work
U||   Which not even critics criticise,
U||   when I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which
U||   follows:
U||   “The avenues to death are numerous and strange. A London paper mentions
U||   the decease of a person from a singular cause. He was playing at ‘puff
U||   the dart,’ which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted,
U||   and blown at a target through a tin tube. He placed the needle at the
U||   wrong end of the tube, and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart
U||   forward with force, drew the needle into his throat. It entered the
U||   lungs, and in a few days killed him.”
U||   Upon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing why.
U||   “This thing,” I exclaimed, “is a contemptible falsehood—a poor hoax—the
U||   lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner, of some wretched
U||   concocter of accidents in Cocaigne. These fellows knowing the
U||   extravagant gullibility of the age set their wits to work in the
U||   imagination of improbable possibilities, of odd accidents as they term
U||   them, but to a reflecting intellect (like mine, I added, in
U||   parenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my
U||   nose), to a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it
U||   seems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these ‘odd
U||   accidents’ is by far the oddest accident of all. For my own part, I
U||   intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the
U||   ‘singular’ about it.”
U||   “Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!” replied one of the most
U||   remarkable voices I ever heard. At first I took it for a rumbling in my
U||   ears—such as a man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk—but
U||   upon second thought, I considered the sound as more nearly resembling
U||   that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick; and,
U||   in fact, this I should have concluded it to be, but for the
U||   articulation of the syllables and words. I am by no means naturally
U||   nervous, and the very few glasses of Lafitte which I had sipped served
U||   to embolden me a little, so that I felt nothing of trepidation, but
U||   merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement and looked carefully
U||   around the room for the intruder. I could not, however, perceive any
U||   one at all.
U||   “Humph!” resumed the voice as I continued my survey, “you mus pe so
U||   dronk as de pig den for not zee me as I zit here at your zide.”
U||   Hereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and
U||   there, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage
U||   nondescript, although not altogether indescribable. His body was a
U||   wine-pipe or a rum puncheon, or something of that character, and had a
U||   truly Falstaffian air. In its nether extremity were inserted two kegs,
U||   which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs. For arms there dangled
U||   from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles with
U||   the necks outward for hands. All the head that I saw the monster
U||   possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens which resemble a large
U||   snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid. This canteen (with a
U||   funnel on its top like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes) was set
U||   on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and through
U||   this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise
U||   old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling
U||   noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk.
U||   “I zay,” said he, “you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not zee
U||   me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de goose, vor to
U||   dispelief vat iz print in de print. ’Tiz de troof—dat it iz—ebery vord
U||   ob it.”
U||   “Who are you, pray?” said I with much dignity, although somewhat
U||   puzzled; “how did you get here? and what is it you are talking about?”
U||   “As vor ow I com’d ere,” replied the figure, “dat iz none of your
U||   pizziness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat I
U||   tink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I com’d here
U||   for to let you zee for yourself.”
U||   “You are a drunken vagabond,” said I, “and I shall ring the bell and
U||   order my footman to kick you into the street.”
U||   “He! he! he!” said the fellow, “hu! hu! hu! dat you can’t do.”
U||   “Can’t do!” said I, “what do you mean? I can’t do what?”
U||   “Ring de pell,” he replied, attempting a grin with his little
U||   villainous mouth.
U||   Upon this I made an effort to get up in order to put my threat into
U||   execution, but the ruffian just reached across the table very
U||   deliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of one
U||   of the long bottles, knocked me back into the armchair from which I had
U||   half arisen. I was utterly astounded, and for a moment was quite at a
U||   loss what to do. In the meantime he continued his talk.
U||   “You zee,” said he, “it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall
U||   know who I pe. Look at me! zee! I am te Angel ov te Odd.”
U||   “And odd enough, too,” I ventured to reply; “but I was always under the
U||   impression that an angel had wings.”
U||   “Te wing!” he cried, highly incensed, “vat I pe do mit te wing? Mein
U||   Gott! do you take me for a shicken?”
U||   “No—oh, no!” I replied, much alarmed; “you are no chicken—certainly
U||   not.”
U||   “Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I’ll rap you again mid me
U||   vist. It iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing, und te imp ab
U||   te wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing. Te angel ab not te wing, and I
U||   am te Angel ov te Odd.”
U||   “And your business with me at present is—is——”
U||   “My pizziness!” ejaculated the thing, “vy vat a low-bred puppy you mos
U||   pe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness!”
U||   This language was rather more than I could bear, even from an angel;
U||   so, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay within reach,
U||   and hurled it at the head of the intruder. Either he dodged, however,
U||   or my aim was inaccurate; for all I accomplished was the demolition of
U||   the crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon the mantelpiece.
U||   As for the Angel, he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two
U||   or three hard, consecutive raps upon the forehead as before. These
U||   reduced me at once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess
U||   that, either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my
U||   eyes.
U||   “Mein Gott!” said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened at my
U||   distress; “mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry. You
U||   mos not trink it so strong—you mos put te water in te wine. Here, trink
U||   dis, like a good veller, and don’t gry now—don’t!”
U||   Hereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was about a
U||   third full of port) with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of
U||   his hand-bottles. I observed that these bottles had labels about their
U||   necks, and that these labels were inscribed “Kirschenwässer.”
U||   The considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little
U||   measure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my port more
U||   than once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very
U||   extraordinary discourse. I cannot pretend to recount all that he told
U||   me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was a genius who presided
U||   over the contretemps of mankind, and whose business it was to bring
U||   about the odd accidents which are continually astonishing the skeptic.
U||   Once or twice, upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in
U||   respect to his pretensions, he grew very angry indeed, so that at
U||   length I considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all, and let
U||   him have his own way. He talked on, therefore, at great length, while I
U||   merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and amused myself
U||   with munching raisins and filiping the stems about the room. But, by
U||   and by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior of mine into
U||   contempt. He arose in a terrible passion, slouched his funnel down over
U||   his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some character, which
U||   I did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a low bow and
U||   departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in “Gil Bias,”
U||   beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens.
U||   His departure afforded me relief. The very few glasses of Lafitte that
U||   I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and I felt inclined
U||   to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my custom after
U||   dinner. At six I had an appointment of consequence, which it was quite
U||   indispensable that I should keep. The policy of insurance for my
U||   dwelling-house had expired the day before; and some dispute having
U||   arisen it was agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of directors
U||   of the company and settle the terms of a renewal. Glancing upward at
U||   the clock on the mantelpiece (for I felt too drowsy to take out my
U||   watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five minutes
U||   to spare. It was half-past five; I could easily walk to the insurance
U||   office in five minutes; and my usual siestas had never been known to
U||   exceed five-and-twenty. I felt sufficiently safe, therefore, and
U||   composed myself to my slumbers forthwith.
U||   Having completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward the
U||   timepiece, and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd
U||   accidents when I found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty
U||   minutes, I had been dozing only three; for it still wanted
U||   seven-and-twenty of the appointed hour. I betook myself again to my
U||   nap, and at length a second time awoke, when, to my utter amazement, it
U||   still wanted twenty-seven minutes of six. I jumped up to examine the
U||   clock, and found that it had ceased running. My watch informed me that
U||   it was half-past seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I was
U||   too late for my appointment. “It will make no difference,” I said: “I
U||   can call at the office in the morning and apologize; in the meantime
U||   what can be the matter with the clock?” Upon examining it I discovered
U||   that one of the raisin stems which I had been filiping about the room
U||   during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd had flown through the
U||   fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in the keyhole, with
U||   an end projecting outward, had thus arrested the revolution of the
U||   minute hand.
U||   “Ah!” said I, “I see how it is. This thing speaks for itself. A natural
U||   accident, such as will happen now and then!”
U||   I gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour
U||   retired to bed. Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand at
U||   the bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the
U||   Omnipresence of the Deity, I unfortunately fell asleep in less than
U||   twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was.
U||   My dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of the
U||   Odd. Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside the
U||   curtains, and in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum puncheon,
U||   menaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which I
U||   had treated him. He concluded a long harangue by taking off his
U||   funnel-cap, inserting the tube into my gullet, and thus deluging me
U||   with an ocean of Kirschenwässer, which he poured in a continuous flood,
U||   from one of the long-necked bottles that stood him instead of an arm.
U||   My agony was at length insufferable, and I awoke just in time to
U||   perceive that a rat had run off with the lighted candle from the stand,
U||   but not in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the
U||   hole, Very soon a strong, suffocating odor assailed my nostrils; the
U||   house, I clearly perceived, was on fire. In a few minutes the blaze
U||   broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly brief period the entire
U||   building was wrapped in flames. All egress from my chamber, except
U||   through a window, was cut off. The crowd, however, quickly procured and
U||   raised a long ladder. By means of this I was descending rapidly, and in
U||   apparent safety, when a huge hog, about whose rotund stomach, and
U||   indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy, there was something which
U||   reminded me of the Angel of the Odd—when this hog, I say, which
U||   hitherto had been quietly slumbering in the mud, took it suddenly into
U||   his head that his left shoulder needed scratching, and could find no
U||   more convenient rubbing-post than that afforded by the foot of the
U||   ladder. In an instant I was precipitated, and had the misfortune to
U||   fracture my arm.
U||   This accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more serious
U||   loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off by the fire,
U||   predisposed me to serious impressions, so that finally I made up my
U||   mind to take a wife. There was a rich widow disconsolate for the loss
U||   of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I offered the balm of
U||   my vows. She yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers. I knelt at her
U||   feet in gratitude and adoration. She blushed and bowed her luxuriant
U||   tresses into close contact with those supplied me temporarily by
U||   Grandjean. I know not how the entanglement took place but so it was. I
U||   arose with a shining pate, wigless; she in disdain and wrath,
U||   half-buried in alien hair. Thus ended my hopes of the widow by an
U||   accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but which
U||   the natural sequence of events had brought about.
U||   Without despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less implacable
U||   heart. The fates were again propitious for a brief period, but again a
U||   trivial incident interfered. Meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged
U||   with the elite of the city, I was hastening to greet her with one of my
U||   best considered bows, when a small particle of some foreign matter
U||   lodging in the corner of my eye rendered me for the moment completely
U||   blind. Before I could recover my sight, the lady of my love had
U||   disappeared—irreparably affronted at what she chose to consider my
U||   premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted. While I stood
U||   bewildered at the suddenness of this accident (which might have
U||   happened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while I still
U||   continued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel of the Odd,
U||   who proffered me his aid with a civility which I had no reason to
U||   expect. He examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and skill,
U||   informed me that I had a drop in it, and (whatever a “drop” was) took
U||   it out, and afforded me relief.
U||   I now considered it high time to die (since fortune had so determined
U||   to persecute me), and accordingly made my way to the nearest river.
U||   Here, divesting myself of my clothes (for there is no reason why we
U||   cannot die as we were born), I threw myself headlong into the current;
U||   the sole witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been seduced
U||   into the eating of brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered away
U||   from his fellows. No sooner had I entered the water than this bird took
U||   it into his head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my
U||   apparel. Postponing, therefore, for the present, my suicidal design, I
U||   just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat, and
U||   betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which
U||   the case required and its circumstances would admit. But my evil
U||   destiny attended me still. As I ran at full speed, with my nose up in
U||   the atmosphere, and intent only upon the purloiner of my property, I
U||   suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon terra firma; the
U||   fact is, I had thrown myself over a precipice, and should inevitably
U||   have been dashed to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end
U||   of a long guide-rope, which depended from a passing balloon.
U||   As soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the
U||   terrific predicament in which I stood, or rather hung, I exerted all
U||   the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the aeronaut
U||   overhead. But for a long time I exerted myself in vain. Either the fool
U||   could not, or the villain would not perceive me. Meanwhile the machine
U||   rapidly soared, while my strength even more rapidly failed. I was soon
U||   upon the point of resigning myself to my fate, and dropping quietly
U||   into the sea, when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow
U||   voice from above, which seemed to be lazily humming an opera air.
U||   Looking up, I perceived the Angel of the Odd. He was leaning, with his
U||   arms folded, over the rim of the car; and with a pipe in his mouth, at
U||   which he puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms with
U||   himself and the universe. I was too much exhausted to speak, so I
U||   merely regarded him with an imploring air.
U||   For several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he said
U||   nothing. At length, removing carefully his meerschaum from the right to
U||   the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak.
U||   “Who pe you,” he asked, “und what der teuffel you pe do dare?”
U||   To this piece of impudence, cruelty, and affectation, I could reply
U||   only by ejaculating the monosyllable “Help!”
U||   “Elp!” echoed the ruffian, “not I. Dare iz te pottle—elp yourself, und
U||   pe tam’d!”
U||   With these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwässer, which,
U||   dropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to imagine that
U||   my brains were entirely knocked out. Impressed with this idea I was
U||   about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace,
U||   when I was arrested by the cry of the Angel, who bade me hold on.
U||   “’Old on!” he said: “don’t pe in te ’urry—don’t. Will you pe take de
U||   odder pottle, or ’ave you pe got zober yet, and come to your zenzes?”
U||   I made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice—once in the negative,
U||   meaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle at
U||   present; and once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply that I
U||   was sober and had positively come to my senses. By these means I
U||   somewhat softened the Angel.
U||   “Und you pelief, ten,” he inquired, “at te last? You pelief, ten, in te
U||   possibility of te odd?”
U||   I again nodded my head in assent.
U||   “Und you ave pelief in me, te Angel of te Odd?”
U||   I nodded again.
U||   “Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk und te vool?”
U||   I nodded once more.
U||   “Put your right hand into your left preeches pocket, ten, in token ov
U||   your vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd.”
U||   This thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible to
U||   do. In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall from the
U||   ladder, and therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand I must
U||   have let go altogether. In the second place, I could have no breeches
U||   until I came across the crow. I was therefore obliged, much to my
U||   regret, to shake my head in the negative, intending thus to give the
U||   Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that moment,
U||   to comply with his very reasonable demand! No sooner, however, had I
U||   ceased shaking my head than—
U||   “Go to der teuffel, ten!” roared the Angel of the Odd.
U||   In pronouncing these words he drew a sharp knife across the guide-rope
U||   by which I was suspended, and as we then happened to be precisely over
U||   my own house (which, during my peregrinations, had been handsomely
U||   rebuilt), it so occurred that I tumbled headlong down the ample chimney
U||   and alit upon the dining-room hearth.
U||   Upon coming to my senses (for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me)
U||   I found it about four o’clock in the morning. I lay outstretched where
U||   I had fallen from the balloon. My head groveled in the ashes of an
U||   extinguished fire, while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small
U||   table, overthrown, and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert,
U||   intermingled with a newspaper, some broken glasses and shattered
U||   bottles, and an empty jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwässer. Thus revenged
U||   himself the Angel of the Odd.

U||THE SCHOOLMASTER’S PROGRESS[43][12]
U||   By Caroline M.S. Kirkland (1801–1864)
U||   Master William Horner came to our village to school when he was about
U||   eighteen years old: tall, lank, straight-sided, and straight-haired,
U||   with a mouth of the most puckered and solemn kind. His figure and
U||   movements were those of a puppet cut out of shingle and jerked by a
U||   string; and his address corresponded very well with his appearance.
U||   Never did that prim mouth give way before a laugh. A faint and misty
U||   smile was the widest departure from its propriety, and this
U||   unaccustomed disturbance made wrinkles in the flat, skinny cheeks like
U||   those in the surface of a lake, after the intrusion of a stone. Master
U||   Horner knew well what belonged to the pedagogical character, and that
U||   facial solemnity stood high on the list of indispensable
U||   qualifications. He had made up his mind before he left his father’s
U||   house how he would look during the term. He had not planned any smiles
U||   (knowing that he must “board round”), and it was not for ordinary
U||   occurrences to alter his arrangements; so that when he was betrayed
U||   into a relaxation of the muscles, it was “in such a sort” as if he was
U||   putting his bread and butter in jeopardy.
U||   Truly he had a grave time that first winter. The rod of power was new
U||   to him, and he felt it his “duty” to use it more frequently than might
U||   have been thought necessary by those upon whose sense the privilege had
U||   palled. Tears and sulky faces, and impotent fists doubled fiercely when
U||   his back was turned, were the rewards of his conscientiousness; and the
U||   boys—and girls too—were glad when working time came round again, and
U||   the master went home to help his father on the farm.
U||   But with the autumn came Master Horner again, dropping among us as
U||   quietly as the faded leaves, and awakening at least as much serious
U||   reflection. Would he be as self-sacrificing as before, postponing his
U||   own ease and comfort to the public good, or would he have become more
U||   sedentary, and less fond of circumambulating the school-room with a
U||   switch over his shoulder? Many were fain to hope he might have learned
U||   to smoke during the summer, an accomplishment which would probably have
U||   moderated his energy not a little, and disposed him rather to reverie
U||   than to action. But here he was, and all the broader-chested and
U||   stouter-armed for his labors in the harvest-field.
U||   Let it not be supposed that Master Horner was of a cruel and ogrish
U||   nature—a babe-eater—a Herod—one who delighted in torturing the
U||   helpless. Such souls there may be, among those endowed with the awful
U||   control of the ferule, but they are rare in the fresh and natural
U||   regions we describe. It is, we believe, where young gentlemen are to be
U||   crammed for college, that the process of hardening heart and skin
U||   together goes on most vigorously. Yet among the uneducated there is so
U||   high a respect for bodily strength, that it is necessary for the
U||   schoolmaster to show, first of all, that he possesses this inadmissible
U||   requisite for his place. The rest is more readily taken for granted.
U||   Brains he may have—a strong arm he must have: so he proves the more
U||   important claim first. We must therefore make all due allowance for
U||   Master Horner, who could not be expected to overtop his position so far
U||   as to discern at once the philosophy of teaching.
U||   He was sadly brow-beaten during his first term of service by a great
U||   broad-shouldered lout of some eighteen years or so, who thought he
U||   needed a little more “schooling,” but at the same time felt quite
U||   competent to direct the manner and measure of his attempts.
U||   “You’d ought to begin with large-hand, Joshuay,” said Master Horner to
U||   this youth.
U||   “What should I want coarse-hand for?” said the disciple, with great
U||   contempt; “coarse-hand won’t never do me no good. I want a fine-hand
U||   copy.”
U||   The master looked at the infant giant, and did as he wished, but we say
U||   not with what secret resolutions.
U||   At another time, Master Horner, having had a hint from some one more
U||   knowing than himself, proposed to his elder scholars to write after
U||   dictation, expatiating at the same time quite floridly (the ideas
U||   having been supplied by the knowing friend), upon the advantages likely
U||   to arise from this practice, and saying, among other things,
U||   “It will help you, when you write letters, to spell the words good.”
U||   “Pooh!” said Joshua, “spellin’ ain’t nothin’; let them that finds the
U||   mistakes correct ’em. I’m for every one’s havin’ a way of their own.”
U||   “How dared you be so saucy to the master?” asked one of the little
U||   boys, after school.
U||   “Because I could lick him, easy,” said the hopeful Joshua, who knew
U||   very well why the master did not undertake him on the spot.
U||   Can we wonder that Master Horner determined to make his empire good as
U||   far as it went?
U||   A new examination was required on the entrance into a second term, and,
U||   with whatever secret trepidation, the master was obliged to submit. Our
U||   law prescribes examinations, but forgets to provide for the competency
U||   of the examiners; so that few better farces offer than the course of
U||   question and answer on these occasions. We know not precisely what were
U||   Master Horner’s trials; but we have heard of a sharp dispute between
U||   the inspectors whether a-n-g-e-l spelt angle or angel. Angle had it,
U||   and the school maintained that pronunciation ever after. Master Horner
U||   passed, and he was requested to draw up the certificate for the
U||   inspectors to sign, as one had left his spectacles at home, and the
U||   other had a bad cold, so that it was not convenient for either to write
U||   more than his name. Master Homer’s exhibition of learning on this
U||   occasion did not reach us, but we know that it must have been
U||   considerable, since he stood the ordeal.
U||   “What is orthography?” said an inspector once, in our presence.
U||   The candidate writhed a good deal, studied the beams overhead and the
U||   chickens out of the window, and then replied,
U||   “It is so long since I learnt the first part of the spelling-book, that
U||   I can’t justly answer that question. But if I could just look it over,
U||   I guess I could.”
U||   Our schoolmaster entered upon his second term with new courage and
U||   invigorated authority. Twice certified, who should dare doubt his
U||   competency? Even Joshua was civil, and lesser louts of course
U||   obsequious; though the girls took more liberties, for they feel even at
U||   that early age, that influence is stronger than strength.
U||   Could a young schoolmaster think of feruling a girl with her hair in
U||   ringlets and a gold ring on her finger? Impossible—and the immunity
U||   extended to all the little sisters and cousins; and there were enough
U||   large girls to protect all the feminine part of the school. With the
U||   boys Master Horner still had many a battle, and whether with a view to
U||   this, or as an economical ruse, he never wore his coat in school,
U||   saying it was too warm. Perhaps it was an astute attention to the
U||   prejudices of his employers, who love no man that does not earn his
U||   living by the sweat of his brow. The shirt-sleeves gave the idea of a
U||   manual-labor school in one sense at least. It was evident that the
U||   master worked, and that afforded a probability that the scholars worked
U||   too.
U||   Master Horner’s success was most triumphant that winter. A year’s
U||   growth had improved his outward man exceedingly, filling out the limbs
U||   so that they did not remind you so forcibly of a young colt’s, and
U||   supplying the cheeks with the flesh and blood so necessary where
U||   mustaches were not worn. Experience had given him a degree of
U||   confidence, and confidence gave him power. In short, people said the
U||   master had waked up; and so he had. He actually set about reading for
U||   improvement; and although at the end of the term he could not quite
U||   make out from his historical studies which side Hannibal was on, yet
U||   this is readily explained by the fact that he boarded round, and was
U||   obliged to read generally by firelight, surrounded by ungoverned
U||   children.
U||   After this, Master Horner made his own bargain. When schooltime came
U||   round with the following autumn, and the teacher presented himself for
U||   a third examination, such a test was pronounced no longer necessary;
U||   and the district consented to engage him at the astounding rate of
U||   sixteen dollars a month, with the understanding that he was to have a
U||   fixed home, provided he was willing to allow a dollar a week for it.
U||   Master Horner bethought him of the successive “killing-times,” and
U||   consequent doughnuts of the twenty families in which he had sojourned
U||   the years before, and consented to the exaction.
U||   Behold our friend now as high as district teacher can ever hope to
U||   be—his scholarship established, his home stationary and not revolving,
U||   and the good behavior of the community insured by the fact that he,
U||   being of age, had now a farm to retire upon in case of any disgust.
U||   Master Horner was at once the preëminent beau of the neighborhood,
U||   spite of the prejudice against learning. He brushed his hair straight
U||   up in front, and wore a sky-blue ribbon for a guard to his silver
U||   watch, and walked as if the tall heels of his blunt boots were
U||   egg-shells and not leather. Yet he was far from neglecting the duties
U||   of his place. He was beau only on Sundays and holidays; very
U||   schoolmaster the rest of the time.
U||   It was at a “spelling-school” that Master Horner first met the educated
U||   eyes of Miss Harriet Bangle, a young lady visiting the Engleharts in
U||   our neighborhood. She was from one of the towns in Western New York,
U||   and had brought with her a variety of city airs and graces somewhat
U||   caricatured, set off with year-old French fashions much travestied.
U||   Whether she had been sent out to the new country to try, somewhat late,
U||   a rustic chance for an establishment, or whether her company had been
U||   found rather trying at home, we cannot say. The view which she was at
U||   some pains to make understood was, that her friends had contrived this
U||   method of keeping her out of the way of a desperate lover whose
U||   addresses were not acceptable to them.
U||   If it should seem surprising that so high-bred a visitor should be
U||   sojourning in the wild woods, it must be remembered that more than one
U||   celebrated Englishman and not a few distinguished Americans have farmer
U||   brothers in the western country, no whit less rustic in their exterior
U||   and manner of life than the plainest of their neighbors. When these are
U||   visited by their refined kinsfolk, we of the woods catch glimpses of
U||   the gay world, or think we do.
U||   That great medicine hath
U||   With its tinct gilded—
U||   many a vulgarism to the satisfaction of wiser heads than ours.
U||   Miss Bangle’s manner bespoke for her that high consideration which she
U||   felt to be her due. Yet she condescended to be amused by the rustics
U||   and their awkward attempts at gaiety and elegance; and, to say truth,
U||   few of the village merry-makings escaped her, though she wore always
U||   the air of great superiority.
U||   The spelling-school is one of the ordinary winter amusements in the
U||   country. It occurs once in a fortnight, or so, and has power to draw
U||   out all the young people for miles round, arrayed in their best clothes
U||   and their holiday behavior. When all is ready, umpires are elected, and
U||   after these have taken the distinguished place usually occupied by the
U||   teacher, the young people of the school choose the two best scholars to
U||   head the opposing classes. These leaders choose their followers from
U||   the mass, each calling a name in turn, until all the spellers are
U||   ranked on one side or the other, lining the sides of the room, and all
U||   standing. The schoolmaster, standing too, takes his spelling-book, and
U||   gives a placid yet awe-inspiring look along the ranks, remarking that
U||   he intends to be very impartial, and that he shall give out nothing
U||   that is not in the spelling-book. For the first half hour or so he
U||   chooses common and easy words, that the spirit of the evening may not
U||   be damped by the too early thinning of the classes. When a word is
U||   missed, the blunderer has to sit down, and be a spectator only for the
U||   rest of the evening. At certain intervals, some of the best speakers
U||   mount the platform, and “speak a piece,” which is generally as
U||   declamatory as possible.
U||   The excitement of this scene is equal to that afforded by any city
U||   spectacle whatever; and towards the close of the evening, when
U||   difficult and unusual words are chosen to confound the small number who
U||   still keep the floor, it becomes scarcely less than painful. When
U||   perhaps only one or two remain to be puzzled, the master, weary at last
U||   of his task, though a favorite one, tries by tricks to put down those
U||   whom he cannot overcome in fair fight. If among all the curious,
U||   useless, unheard-of words which may be picked out of the spelling-book,
U||   he cannot find one which the scholars have not noticed, he gets the
U||   last head down by some quip or catch. “Bay” will perhaps be the sound;
U||   one scholar spells it “bey,” another, “bay,” while the master all the
U||   time means “ba,” which comes within the rule, being in the
U||   spelling-book.
U||   It was on one of these occasions, as we have said, that Miss Bangle,
U||   having come to the spelling-school to get materials for a letter to a
U||   female friend, first shone upon Mr. Horner. She was excessively amused
U||   by his solemn air and puckered mouth, and set him down at once as fair
U||   game. Yet she could not help becoming somewhat interested in the
U||   spelling-school, and after it was over found she had not stored up half
U||   as many of the schoolmaster’s points as she intended, for the benefit
U||   of her correspondent.
U||   In the evening’s contest a young girl from some few miles’ distance,
U||   Ellen Kingsbury, the only child of a substantial farmer, had been the
U||   very last to sit down, after a prolonged effort on the part of Mr.
U||   Horner to puzzle her, for the credit of his own school. She blushed,
U||   and smiled, and blushed again, but spelt on, until Mr. Horner’s cheeks
U||   were crimson with excitement and some touch of shame that he should be
U||   baffled at his own weapons. At length, either by accident or design,
U||   Ellen missed a word, and sinking into her seat was numbered with the
U||   slain.
U||   In the laugh and talk which followed (for with the conclusion of the
U||   spelling, all form of a public assembly vanishes), our schoolmaster
U||   said so many gallant things to his fair enemy, and appeared so much
U||   animated by the excitement of the contest, that Miss Bangle began to
U||   look upon him with rather more respect, and to feel somewhat indignant
U||   that a little rustic like Ellen should absorb the entire attention of
U||   the only beau. She put on, therefore, her most gracious aspect, and
U||   mingled in the circle; caused the schoolmaster to be presented to her,
U||   and did her best to fascinate him by certain airs and graces which she
U||   had found successful elsewhere. What game is too small for the
U||   close-woven net of a coquette?
U||   Mr. Horner quitted not the fair Ellen until he had handed her into her
U||   father’s sleigh; and he then wended his way homewards, never thinking
U||   that he ought to have escorted Miss Bangle to her uncle’s, though she
U||   certainly waited a little while for his return.
U||   We must not follow into particulars the subsequent intercourse of our
U||   schoolmaster with the civilized young lady. All that concerns us is the
U||   result of Miss Bangle’s benevolent designs upon his heart. She tried
U||   most sincerely to find its vulnerable spot, meaning no doubt to put Mr.
U||   Homer on his guard for the future; and she was unfeignedly surprised to
U||   discover that her best efforts were of no avail. She concluded he must
U||   have taken a counter-poison, and she was not slow in guessing its
U||   source. She had observed the peculiar fire which lighted up his eyes in
U||   the presence of Ellen Kingsbury, and she bethought her of a plan which
U||   would ensure her some amusement at the expense of these impertinent
U||   rustics, though in a manner different somewhat from her original more
U||   natural idea of simple coquetry.
U||   A letter was written to Master Horner, purporting to come from Ellen
U||   Kingsbury, worded so artfully that the schoolmaster understood at once
U||   that it was intended to be a secret communication, though its
U||   ostensible object was an inquiry about some ordinary affair. This was
U||   laid in Mr. Horner’s desk before he came to school, with an intimation
U||   that he might leave an answer in a certain spot on the following
U||   morning. The bait took at once, for Mr. Horner, honest and true
U||   himself, and much smitten with the fair Ellen, was too happy to be
U||   circumspect. The answer was duly placed, and as duly carried to Miss
U||   Bangle by her accomplice, Joe Englehart, an unlucky pickle who “was
U||   always for ill, never for good,” and who found no difficulty in
U||   obtaining the letter unwatched, since the master was obliged to be in
U||   school at nine, and Joe could always linger a few minutes later. This
U||   answer being opened and laughed at, Miss Bangle had only to contrive a
U||   rejoinder, which being rather more particular in its tone than the
U||   original communication, led on yet again the happy schoolmaster, who
U||   branched out into sentiment, “taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,”
U||   talked of hills and dales and rivulets, and the pleasures of
U||   friendship, and concluded by entreating a continuance of the
U||   correspondence.
U||   Another letter and another, every one more flattering and encouraging
U||   than the last, almost turned the sober head of our poor master, and
U||   warmed up his heart so effectually that he could scarcely attend to his
U||   business. The spelling-schools were remembered, however, and Ellen
U||   Kingsbury made one of the merry company; but the latest letter had not
U||   forgotten to caution Mr. Horner not to betray the intimacy; so that he
U||   was in honor bound to restrict himself to the language of the eyes hard
U||   as it was to forbear the single whisper for which he would have given
U||   his very dictionary. So, their meeting passed off without the
U||   explanation which Miss Bangle began to fear would cut short her
U||   benevolent amusement.
U||   The correspondence was resumed with renewed spirit, and carried on
U||   until Miss Bangle, though not overburdened with sensitiveness, began to
U||   be a little alarmed for the consequences of her malicious pleasantry.
U||   She perceived that she herself had turned schoolmistress, and that
U||   Master Horner, instead of being merely her dupe, had become her pupil
U||   too; for the style of his replies had been constantly improving and the
U||   earnest and manly tone which he assumed promised any thing but the
U||   quiet, sheepish pocketing of injury and insult, upon which she had
U||   counted. In truth, there was something deeper than vanity in the
U||   feelings with which he regarded Ellen Kingsbury. The encouragement
U||   which he supposed himself to have received, threw down the barrier
U||   which his extreme bashfulness would have interposed between himself and
U||   any one who possessed charms enough to attract him; and we must excuse
U||   him if, in such a case, he did not criticise the mode of encouragement,
U||   but rather grasped eagerly the proffered good without a scruple, or one
U||   which he would own to himself, as to the propriety with which it was
U||   tendered. He was as much in love as a man can be, and the seriousness
U||   of real attachment gave both grace and dignity to his once awkward
U||   diction.
U||   The evident determination of Mr. Horner to come to the point of asking
U||   papa brought Miss Bangle to a very awkward pass. She had expected to
U||   return home before matters had proceeded so far, but being obliged to
U||   remain some time longer, she was equally afraid to go on and to leave
U||   off, a dénouement being almost certain to ensue in either case. Things
U||   stood thus when it was time to prepare for the grand exhibition which
U||   was to close the winter’s term.
U||   This is an affair of too much magnitude to be fully described in the
U||   small space yet remaining in which to bring out our veracious history.
U||   It must be “slubber’d o’er in haste”—its important preliminaries left
U||   to the cold imagination of the reader—its fine spirit perhaps
U||   evaporating for want of being embodied in words. We can only say that
U||   our master, whose school-life was to close with the term, labored as
U||   man never before labored in such a cause, resolute to trail a cloud of
U||   glory after him when he left us. Not a candlestick nor a curtain that
U||   was attainable, either by coaxing or bribery, was left in the village;
U||   even the only piano, that frail treasure, was wiled away and placed in
U||   one corner of the rickety stage. The most splendid of all the pieces in
U||   the Columbian Orator, the American Speaker, the——but we must not
U||   enumerate—in a word, the most astounding and pathetic specimens of
U||   eloquence within ken of either teacher or scholars, had been selected
U||   for the occasion; and several young ladies and gentlemen, whose
U||   academical course had been happily concluded at an earlier period,
U||   either at our own institution or at some other, had consented to lend
U||   themselves to the parts, and their choicest decorations for the
U||   properties, of the dramatic portion of the entertainment.
U||   Among these last was pretty Ellen Kingsbury, who had agreed to
U||   personate the Queen of Scots, in the garden scene from Schiller’s
U||   tragedy of Mary Stuart; and this circumstance accidentally afforded
U||   Master Horner the opportunity he had so long desired, of seeing his
U||   fascinating correspondent without the presence of peering eyes. A
U||   dress-rehearsal occupied the afternoon before the day of days, and the
U||   pathetic expostulations of the lovely Mary—
U||   Mine all doth hang—my life—my destiny—
U||   Upon my words—upon the force of tears!—
U||   aided by the long veil, and the emotion which sympathy brought into
U||   Ellen’s countenance, proved too much for the enforced prudence of
U||   Master Horner. When the rehearsal was over, and the heroes and heroines
U||   were to return home, it was found that, by a stroke of witty invention
U||   not new in the country, the harness of Mr. Kingsbury’s horses had been
U||   cut in several places, his whip hidden, his buffalo-skins spread on the
U||   ground, and the sleigh turned bottom upwards on them. This afforded an
U||   excuse for the master’s borrowing a horse and sleigh of somebody, and
U||   claiming the privilege of taking Miss Ellen home, while her father
U||   returned with only Aunt Sally and a great bag of bran from the
U||   mill—companions about equally interesting.
U||   Here, then, was the golden opportunity so long wished for! Here was the
U||   power of ascertaining at once what is never quite certain until we have
U||   heard it from warm, living lips, whose testimony is strengthened by
U||   glances in which the whole soul speaks or—seems to speak. The time was
U||   short, for the sleighing was but too fine; and Father Kingsbury, having
U||   tied up his harness, and collected his scattered equipment, was driving
U||   so close behind that there was no possibility of lingering for a
U||   moment. Yet many moments were lost before Mr. Horner, very much in
U||   earnest, and all unhackneyed in matters of this sort, could find a word
U||   in which to clothe his new-found feelings. The horse seemed to fly—the
U||   distance was half past—and at length, in absolute despair of anything
U||   better, he blurted out at once what he had determined to avoid—a direct
U||   reference to the correspondence.
U||   A game at cross-purposes ensued; exclamations and explanations, and
U||   denials and apologies filled up the time which was to have made Master
U||   Horner so blest. The light from Mr. Kingsbury’s windows shone upon the
U||   path, and the whole result of this conference so longed for, was a
U||   burst of tears from the perplexed and mortified Ellen, who sprang from
U||   Mr. Horner’s attempts to detain her, rushed into the house without
U||   vouchsafing him a word of adieu, and left him standing, no bad
U||   personification of Orpheus, after the last hopeless flitting of his
U||   Eurydice.
U||   “Won’t you ’light, Master?” said Mr. Kingsbury.
U||   “Yes—no—thank you—good evening,” stammered poor Master Horner, so
U||   stupefied that even Aunt Sally called him “a dummy.”
U||   The horse took the sleigh against the fence, going home, and threw out
U||   the master, who scarcely recollected the accident; while to Ellen the
U||   issue of this unfortunate drive was a sleepless night and so high a
U||   fever in the morning that our village doctor was called to Mr.
U||   Kingsbury’s before breakfast.
U||   Poor Master Horner’s distress may hardly be imagined. Disappointed,
U||   bewildered, cut to the quick, yet as much in love as ever, he could
U||   only in bitter silence turn over in his thoughts the issue of his
U||   cherished dream; now persuading himself that Ellen’s denial was the
U||   effect of a sudden bashfulness, now inveighing against the fickleness
U||   of the sex, as all men do when they are angry with any one woman in
U||   particular. But his exhibition must go on in spite of wretchedness; and
U||   he went about mechanically, talking of curtains and candles, and music,
U||   and attitudes, and pauses, and emphasis, looking like a somnambulist
U||   whose “eyes are open but their sense is shut,” and often surprising
U||   those concerned by the utter unfitness of his answers.
U||   It was almost evening when Mr. Kingsbury, having discovered, through
U||   the intervention of the Doctor and Aunt Sally the cause of Ellen’s
U||   distress, made his appearance before the unhappy eyes of Master Horner,
U||   angry, solemn and determined; taking the schoolmaster apart, and
U||   requiring, an explanation of his treatment of his daughter. In vain did
U||   the perplexed lover ask for time to clear himself, declare his respect
U||   for Miss Ellen and his willingness to give every explanation which she
U||   might require; the father was not to be put off; and though excessively
U||   reluctant, Mr. Horner had no resource but to show the letters which
U||   alone could account for his strange discourse to Ellen. He unlocked his
U||   desk, slowly and unwillingly, while the old man’s impatience was such
U||   that he could scarcely forbear thrusting in his own hand to snatch at
U||   the papers which were to explain this vexatious mystery. What could
U||   equal the utter confusion of Master Horner and the contemptuous anger
U||   of the father, when no letters were to be found! Mr. Kingsbury was too
U||   passionate to listen to reason, or to reflect for one moment upon the
U||   irreproachable good name of the schoolmaster. He went away in
U||   inexorable wrath; threatening every practicable visitation of public
U||   and private justice upon the head of the offender, whom he accused of
U||   having attempted to trick his daughter into an entanglement which
U||   should result in his favor.
U||   A doleful exhibition was this last one of our thrice approved and most
U||   worthy teacher! Stern necessity and the power of habit enabled him to
U||   go through with most of his part, but where was the proud fire which
U||   had lighted up his eye on similar occasions before? He sat as one of
U||   three judges before whom the unfortunate Robert Emmet was dragged in
U||   his shirt-sleeves, by two fierce-looking officials; but the chief judge
U||   looked far more like a criminal than did the proper representative. He
U||   ought to have personated Othello, but was obliged to excuse himself
U||   from raving for “the handkerchief! the handkerchief!” on the rather
U||   anomalous plea of a bad cold. Mary Stuart being “i’ the bond,” was
U||   anxiously expected by the impatient crowd, and it was with distress
U||   amounting to agony that the master was obliged to announce, in person,
U||   the necessity of omitting that part of the representation, on account
U||   of the illness of one of the young ladies.
U||   Scarcely had the words been uttered, and the speaker hidden his burning
U||   face behind the curtain, when Mr. Kingsbury started up in his place
U||   amid the throng, to give a public recital of his grievance—no uncommon
U||   resort in the new country. He dashed at once to the point; and before
U||   some friends who saw the utter impropriety of his proceeding could
U||   persuade him to defer his vengeance, he had laid before the
U||   assembly—some three hundred people, perhaps—his own statement of the
U||   case. He was got out at last, half coaxed, half hustled; and the gentle
U||   public only half understanding what had been set forth thus
U||   unexpectedly, made quite a pretty row of it. Some clamored loudly for
U||   the conclusion of the exercises; others gave utterances in no
U||   particularly choice terms to a variety of opinions as to the
U||   schoolmaster’s proceedings, varying the note occasionally by shouting,
U||   “The letters! the letters! why don’t you bring out the letters?”
U||   At length, by means of much rapping on the desk by the president of the
U||   evening, who was fortunately a “popular” character, order was partially
U||   restored; and the favorite scene from Miss More’s dialogue of David and
U||   Goliath was announced as the closing piece. The sight of little David
U||   in a white tunic edged with red tape, with a calico scrip and a very
U||   primitive-looking sling; and a huge Goliath decorated with a militia
U||   belt and sword, and a spear like a weaver’s beam indeed, enchained
U||   everybody’s attention. Even the peccant schoolmaster and his pretended
U||   letters were forgotten, while the sapient Goliath, every time that he
U||   raised the spear, in the energy of his declamation, to thump upon the
U||   stage, picked away fragments of the low ceiling, which fell
U||   conspicuously on his great shock of black hair. At last, with the
U||   crowning threat, up went the spear for an astounding thump, and down
U||   came a large piece of the ceiling, and with it—a shower of letters.
U||   The confusion that ensued beggars all description. A general scramble
U||   took place, and in another moment twenty pairs of eyes, at least, were
U||   feasting on the choice phrases lavished upon Mr. Horner. Miss Bangle
U||   had sat through the whole previous scene, trembling for herself,
U||   although she had, as she supposed, guarded cunningly against exposure.
U||   She had needed no prophet to tell her what must be the result of a
U||   tête-à-tête between Mr. Horner and Ellen; and the moment she saw them
U||   drive off together, she induced her imp to seize the opportunity of
U||   abstracting the whole parcel of letters from Mr. Horner’s desk; which
U||   he did by means of a sort of skill which comes by nature to such
U||   goblins; picking the lock by the aid of a crooked nail, as neatly as if
U||   he had been born within the shadow of the Tombs.
U||   But magicians sometimes suffer severely from the malice with which they
U||   have themselves inspired their familiars. Joe Englehart having been a
U||   convenient tool thus far thought it quite time to torment Miss Bangle a
U||   little; so, having stolen the letters at her bidding, he hid them on
U||   his own account, and no persuasions of hers could induce him to reveal
U||   this important secret, which he chose to reserve as a rod in case she
U||   refused him some intercession with his father, or some other
U||   accommodation, rendered necessary by his mischievous habits.
U||   He had concealed the precious parcels in the unfloored loft above the
U||   school-room, a place accessible only by means of a small trap-door
U||   without staircase or ladder; and here he meant to have kept them while
U||   it suited his purposes, but for the untimely intrusion of the weaver’s
U||   beam.
U||   Miss Bangle had sat through all, as we have said, thinking the letters
U||   safe, yet vowing vengeance against her confederate for not allowing her
U||   to secure them by a satisfactory conflagration; and it was not until
U||   she heard her own name whispered through the crowd, that she was
U||   awakened to her true situation. The sagacity of the low creatures whom
U||   she had despised showed them at once that the letters must be hers,
U||   since her character had been pretty shrewdly guessed, and the
U||   handwriting wore a more practised air than is usual among females in
U||   the country. This was first taken for granted, and then spoken of as an
U||   acknowledged fact.
U||   The assembly moved like the heavings of a troubled sea. Everybody felt
U||   that this was everybody’s business. “Put her out!” was heard from more
U||   than one rough voice near the door, and this was responded to by loud
U||   and angry murmurs from within.
U||   Mr. Englehart, not waiting to inquire into the merits of the case in
U||   this scene of confusion, hastened to get his family out as quietly and
U||   as quickly as possible, but groans and hisses followed his niece as she
U||   hung half-fainting on his arm, quailing completely beneath the
U||   instinctive indignation of the rustic public. As she passed out, a yell
U||   resounded among the rude boys about the door, and she was lifted into a
U||   sleigh, insensible from terror. She disappeared from that evening, and
U||   no one knew the time of her final departure for “the east.”
U||   Mr. Kingsbury, who is a just man when he is not in a passion, made all
U||   the reparation in his power for his harsh and ill-considered attack
U||   upon the master; and we believe that functionary did not show any
U||   traits of implacability of character. At least he was seen, not many
U||   days after, sitting peaceably at tea with Mr. Kingsbury, Aunt Sally,
U||   and Miss Ellen; and he has since gone home to build a house upon his
U||   farm. And people do say, that after a few months more, Ellen will not
U||   need Miss Bangle’s intervention if she should see fit to correspond
U||   with the schoolmaster.

U||THE WATKINSON EVENING[45][13]
U||   By Eliza Leslie (1787–1858)
U||   Mrs. Morland, a polished and accomplished woman, was the widow of a
U||   distinguished senator from one of the western states, of which, also,
U||   her husband had twice filled the office of governor. Her daughter
U||   having completed her education at the best boarding-school in
U||   Philadelphia, and her son being about to graduate at Princeton, the
U||   mother had planned with her children a tour to Niagara and the lakes,
U||   returning by way of Boston. On leaving Philadelphia, Mrs. Morland and
U||   the delighted Caroline stopped at Princeton to be present at the annual
U||   commencement, and had the happiness of seeing their beloved Edward
U||   receive his diploma as bachelor of arts; after hearing him deliver,
U||   with great applause, an oration on the beauties of the American
U||   character. College youths are very prone to treat on subjects that
U||   imply great experience of the world. But Edward Morland was full of
U||   kind feeling for everything and everybody; and his views of life had
U||   hitherto been tinted with a perpetual rose-color.
U||   Mrs. Morland, not depending altogether upon the celebrity of her late
U||   husband, and wishing that her children should see specimens of the best
U||   society in the northern cities, had left home with numerous letters of
U||   introduction. But when they arrived at New York, she found to her great
U||   regret, that having unpacked and taken out her small traveling desk,
U||   during her short stay in Philadelphia, she had strangely left it behind
U||   in the closet of her room at the hotel. In this desk were deposited all
U||   her letters, except two which had been offered to her by friends in
U||   Philadelphia. The young people, impatient to see the wonders of
U||   Niagara, had entreated her to stay but a day or two in the city of New
U||   York, and thought these two letters would be quite sufficient for the
U||   present. In the meantime she wrote back to the hotel, requesting that
U||   the missing desk should be forwarded to New York as soon as possible.
U||   On the morning after their arrival at the great commercial metropolis
U||   of America, the Morland family took a carriage to ride round through
U||   the principal parts of the city, and to deliver their two letters at
U||   the houses to which they were addressed, and which were both situated
U||   in the region that lies between the upper part of Broadway and the
U||   North River. In one of the most fashionable streets they found the
U||   elegant mansion of Mrs. St. Leonard; but on stopping at the door, were
U||   informed that its mistress was not at home. They then left the
U||   introductory letter (which they had prepared for this mischance, by
U||   enclosing it in an envelope with a card), and proceeding to another
U||   street considerably farther up, they arrived at the dwelling of the
U||   Watkinson family, to the mistress of which the other Philadelphia
U||   letter was directed. It was one of a large block of houses all exactly
U||   alike, and all shut up from top to bottom, according to a custom more
U||   prevalent in New York than in any other city.
U||   Here they were also unsuccessful; the servant who came to the door
U||   telling them that the ladies were particularly engaged and could see no
U||   company. So they left their second letter and card and drove off,
U||   continuing their ride till they reached the Croton water works, which
U||   they quitted the carriage to see and admire. On returning to the hotel,
U||   with the intention after an hour or two of rest to go out again, and
U||   walk till near dinner-time, they found waiting them a note from Mrs.
U||   Watkinson, expressing her regret that she had not been able to see them
U||   when they called; and explaining that her family duties always obliged
U||   her to deny herself the pleasure of receiving morning visitors, and
U||   that her servants had general orders to that effect. But she requested
U||   their company for that evening (naming nine o’clock as the hour), and
U||   particularly desired an immediate answer.
U||   “I suppose,” said Mrs. Morland, “she intends asking some of her friends
U||   to meet us, in case we accept the invitation; and therefore is
U||   naturally desirous of a reply as soon as possible. Of course we will
U||   not keep her in suspense. Mrs. Denham, who volunteered the letter,
U||   assured me that Mrs. Watkinson was one of the most estimable women in
U||   New York, and a pattern to the circle in which she moved. It seems that
U||   Mr. Denham and Mr. Watkinson are connected in business. Shall we go?”
U||   The young people assented, saying they had no doubt of passing a
U||   pleasant evening.
U||   The billet of acceptance having been written, it was sent off
U||   immediately, entrusted to one of the errand-goers belonging to the
U||   hotel, that it might be received in advance of the next hour for the
U||   dispatch-post—and Edward Morland desired the man to get into an omnibus
U||   with the note that no time might be lost in delivering it. “It is but
U||   right”—said he to his mother—“that we should give Mrs. Watkinson an
U||   ample opportunity of making her preparations, and sending round to
U||   invite her friends.”
U||   “How considerate you are, dear Edward”—said Caroline—“always so
U||   thoughtful of every one’s convenience. Your college friends must have
U||   idolized you.”
U||   “No”—said Edward—“they called me a prig.” Just then a remarkably
U||   handsome carriage drove up to the private door of the hotel. From it
U||   alighted a very elegant woman, who in a few moments was ushered into
U||   the drawing-room by the head waiter, and on his designating Mrs.
U||   Morland’s family, she advanced and gracefully announced herself as Mrs.
U||   St. Leonard. This was the lady at whose house they had left the first
U||   letter of introduction. She expressed regret at not having been at home
U||   when they called; but said that on finding their letter, she had
U||   immediately come down to see them, and to engage them for the evening.
U||   “Tonight”—said Mrs. St. Leonard—“I expect as many friends as I can
U||   collect for a summer party. The occasion is the recent marriage of my
U||   niece, who with her husband has just returned from their bridal
U||   excursion, and they will be soon on their way to their residence in
U||   Baltimore. I think I can promise you an agreeable evening, as I expect
U||   some very delightful people, with whom I shall be most happy to make
U||   you acquainted.”
U||   Edward and Caroline exchanged glances, and could not refrain from
U||   looking wistfully at their mother, on whose countenance a shade of
U||   regret was very apparent. After a short pause she replied to Mrs. St.
U||   Leonard—“I am truly sorry to say that we have just answered in the
U||   affirmative a previous invitation for this very evening.”
U||   “I am indeed disappointed”—said Mrs. St. Leonard, who had been looking
U||   approvingly at the prepossessing appearance of the two young people.
U||   “Is there no way in which you can revoke your compliance with this
U||   unfortunate first invitation—at least, I am sure, it is unfortunate for
U||   me. What a vexatious contretemps that I should have chanced to be out
U||   when you called; thus missing the pleasure of seeing you at once, and
U||   securing that of your society for this evening? The truth is, I was
U||   disappointed in some of the preparations that had been sent home this
U||   morning, and I had to go myself and have the things rectified, and was
U||   detained away longer than I expected. May I ask to whom you are engaged
U||   this evening? Perhaps I know the lady—if so, I should be very much
U||   tempted to go and beg you from her.”
U||   “The lady is Mrs. John Watkinson”—replied Mrs. Morland—“most probably
U||   she will invite some of her friends to meet us.”
U||   “That of course”—answered Mrs. St. Leonard—“I am really very sorry—and
U||   I regret to say that I do not know her at all.”
U||   “We shall have to abide by our first decision,” said Mrs. Morland. “By
U||   Mrs. Watkinson, mentioning in her note the hour of nine, it is to be
U||   presumed she intends asking some other company. I cannot possibly
U||   disappoint her. I can speak feelingly as to the annoyance (for I have
U||   known it by my own experience) when after inviting a number of my
U||   friends to meet some strangers, the strangers have sent an excuse
U||   almost at the eleventh hour. I think no inducements, however strong,
U||   could tempt me to do so myself.”
U||   “I confess that you are perfectly right,” said Mrs. St. Leonard. “I see
U||   you must go to Mrs. Watkinson. But can you not divide the evening, by
U||   passing a part of it with her and then finishing with me?”
U||   At this suggestion the eyes of the young people sparkled, for they had
U||   become delighted with Mrs. St. Leonard, and imagined that a party at
U||   her house must be every way charming. Also, parties were novelties to
U||   both of them.
U||   “If possible we will do so,” answered Mrs. Morland, “and with what
U||   pleasure I need not assure you. We leave New York to-morrow, but we
U||   shall return this way in September, and will then be exceedingly happy
U||   to see more of Mrs. St. Leonard.”
U||   After a little more conversation Mrs. St. Leonard took her leave,
U||   repeating her hope of still seeing her new friends at her house that
U||   night; and enjoining them to let her know as soon as they returned to
U||   New York on their way home.
U||   Edward Morland handed her to her carriage, and then joined his mother
U||   and sister in their commendations of Mrs. St. Leonard, with whose
U||   exceeding beauty were united a countenance beaming with intelligence,
U||   and a manner that put every one at their ease immediately.
U||   “She is an evidence,” said Edward, “how superior our women of fashion
U||   are to those of Europe.”
U||   “Wait, my dear son,” said Mrs. Morland, “till you have been in Europe,
U||   and had an opportunity of forming an opinion on that point (as on many
U||   others) from actual observation. For my part, I believe that in all
U||   civilized countries the upper classes of people are very much alike, at
U||   least in their leading characteristics.”
U||   “Ah! here comes the man that was sent to Mrs. Watkinson,” said Caroline
U||   Morland. “I hope he could not find the house and has brought the note
U||   back with him. We shall then be able to go at first to Mrs. St.
U||   Leonard’s, and pass the whole evening there.”
U||   The man reported that he had found the house, and had delivered the
U||   note into Mrs. Watkinson’s own hands, as she chanced to be crossing the
U||   entry when the door was opened; and that she read it immediately, and
U||   said “Very well.”
U||   “Are you certain that you made no mistake in the house,” said Edward,
U||   “and that you really did give it to Mrs. Watkinson?”
U||   “And it’s quite sure I am, sir,” replied the man, “when I first came
U||   over from the ould country I lived with them awhile, and though when
U||   she saw me to-day, she did not let on that she remembered my doing that
U||   same, she could not help calling me James. Yes, the rale words she said
U||   when I handed her the billy-dux was, ‘Very well, James.’”
U||   “Come, come,” said Edward, when they found themselves alone, “let us
U||   look on the bright side. If we do not find a large party at Mrs.
U||   Watkinson’s, we may in all probability meet some very agreeable people
U||   there, and enjoy the feast of reason and the flow of soul. We may find
U||   the Watkinson house so pleasant as to leave it with regret even for
U||   Mrs. St. Leonard’s.”
U||   “I do not believe Mrs. Watkinson is in fashionable society,” said
U||   Caroline, “or Mrs. St. Leonard would have known her. I heard some of
U||   the ladies here talking last evening of Mrs. St. Leonard, and I found
U||   from what they said that she is among the élite of the lite.”
U||   “Even if she is,” observed Mrs. Morland, “are polish of manners and
U||   cultivation of mind confined exclusively to persons of that class?”
U||   “Certainly not,” said Edward, “the most talented and refined youth at
U||   our college, and he in whose society I found the greatest pleasure, was
U||   the son of a bricklayer.”
U||   In the ladies’ drawing-room, after dinner, the Morlands heard a
U||   conversation between several of the female guests, who all seemed to
U||   know Mrs. St. Leonard very well by reputation, and they talked of her
U||   party that was to “come off” on this evening.
U||   “I hear,” said one lady, “that Mrs. St. Leonard is to have an unusual
U||   number of lions.”
U||   She then proceeded to name a gallant general, with his elegant wife and
U||   accomplished daughter; a celebrated commander in the navy; two highly
U||   distinguished members of Congress, and even an ex-president. Also
U||   several of the most eminent among the American literati, and two
U||   first-rate artists.
U||   Edward Morland felt as if he could say, “Had I three ears I’d hear
U||   thee.”
U||   “Such a woman as Mrs. St. Leonard can always command the best lions
U||   that are to be found,” observed another lady.
U||   “And then,” said a third, “I have been told that she has such exquisite
U||   taste in lighting and embellishing her always elegant rooms. And her
U||   supper table, whether for summer or winter parties, is so beautifully
U||   arranged; all the viands are so delicious, and the attendance of the
U||   servants so perfect—and Mrs. St. Leonard does the honors with so much
U||   ease and tact.”
U||   “Some friends of mine that visit her,” said a fourth lady, “describe
U||   her parties as absolute perfection. She always manages to bring
U||   together those persons that are best fitted to enjoy each other’s
U||   conversation. Still no one is overlooked or neglected. Then everything
U||   at her reunions is so well proportioned—she has just enough of music,
U||   and just enough of whatever amusement may add to the pleasure of her
U||   guests; and still there is no appearance of design or management on her
U||   part.”
U||   “And better than all,” said the lady who had spoken firsts “Mrs. St.
U||   Leonard is one of the kindest, most generous, and most benevolent of
U||   women—she does good in every possible way.”
U||   “I can listen no longer,” said Caroline to Edward, rising to change her
U||   seat. “If I hear any more I shall absolutely hate the Watkinsons. How
U||   provoking that they should have sent us the first invitation. If we had
U||   only thought of waiting till we could hear from Mrs. St. Leonard!”
U||   “For shame, Caroline,” said her brother, “how can you talk so of
U||   persons you have never seen, and to whom you ought to feel grateful for
U||   the kindness of their invitation; even if it has interfered with
U||   another party, that I must confess seems to offer unusual attractions.
U||   Now I have a presentiment that we shall find the Watkinson part of the
U||   evening very enjoyable.”
U||   As soon as tea was over, Mrs. Morland and her daughter repaired to
U||   their toilettes. Fortunately, fashion as well as good taste, has
U||   decided that, at a summer party, the costume of the ladies should never
U||   go beyond an elegant simplicity. Therefore our two ladies in preparing
U||   for their intended appearance at Mrs. St. Leonard’s, were enabled to
U||   attire themselves in a manner that would not seem out of place in the
U||   smaller company they expected to meet at the Watkinsons. Over an
U||   under-dress of lawn, Caroline Morland put on a white organdy trimmed
U||   with lace, and decorated with bows of pink ribbon. At the back of her
U||   head was a wreath of fresh and beautiful pink flowers, tied with a
U||   similar ribbon. Mrs. Morland wore a black grenadine over a satin, and a
U||   lace cap trimmed with white.
U||   It was but a quarter past nine o’clock when their carriage stopped at
U||   the Watkinson door. The front of the house looked very dark. Not a ray
U||   gleamed through the Venetian shutters, and the glimmer beyond the
U||   fan-light over the door was almost imperceptible. After the coachman
U||   had rung several times, an Irish girl opened the door, cautiously (as
U||   Irish girls always do), and admitted them into the entry, where one
U||   light only was burning in a branch lamp. “Shall we go upstairs?” said
U||   Mrs. Morland. “And what for would ye go upstairs?” said the girl in a
U||   pert tone. “It’s all dark there, and there’s no preparations. Ye can
U||   lave your things here a-hanging on the rack. It is a party ye’re
U||   expecting? Blessed are them what expects nothing.”
U||   The sanguine Edward Morland looked rather blank at this intelligence,
U||   and his sister whispered to him, “We’ll get off to Mrs. St. Leonard’s
U||   as soon as we possibly can. When did you tell the coachman to come for
U||   us?”
U||   “At half past ten,” was the brother’s reply.
U||   “Oh! Edward, Edward!” she exclaimed, “And I dare say he will not be
U||   punctual. He may keep us here till eleven.”
U||   “Courage, mes enfants,” said their mother, “et parlez plus doucement.”
U||   The girl then ushered them into the back parlor, saying, “Here’s the
U||   company.”
U||   The room was large and gloomy. A checquered mat covered the floor, and
U||   all the furniture was encased in striped calico covers, and the lamps,
U||   mirrors, etc. concealed under green gauze. The front parlor was
U||   entirely dark, and in the back apartment was no other light than a
U||   shaded lamp on a large centre table, round which was assembled a circle
U||   of children of all sizes and ages. On a backless, cushionless sofa sat
U||   Mrs. Watkinson, and a young lady, whom she introduced as her daughter
U||   Jane. And Mrs. Morland in return presented Edward and Caroline.
U||   “Will you take the rocking-chair, ma’am?” inquired Mrs. Watkinson.
U||   Mrs. Morland declining the offer, the hostess took it herself, and
U||   see-sawed on it nearly the whole time. It was a very awkward,
U||   high-legged, crouch-backed rocking-chair, and shamefully unprovided
U||   with anything in the form of a footstool.
U||   “My husband is away, at Boston, on business,” said Mrs. Watkinson. “I
U||   thought at first, ma’am, I should not be able to ask you here this
U||   evening, for it is not our way to have company in his absence; but my
U||   daughter Jane over-persuaded me to send for you.”
U||   “What a pity,” thought Caroline.
U||   “You must take us as you find us, ma’am,” continued Mrs. Watkinson. “We
U||   use no ceremony with anybody; and our rule is never to put ourselves
U||   out of the way. We do not give parties [looking at the dresses of the
U||   ladies]. Our first duty is to our children, and we cannot waste our
U||   substance on fashion and folly. They’ll have cause to thank us for it
U||   when we die.”
U||   Something like a sob was heard from the centre table, at which the
U||   children were sitting, and a boy was seen to hold his handkerchief to
U||   his face.
U||   “Joseph, my child,” said his mother, “do not cry. You have no idea,
U||   ma’am, what an extraordinary boy that is. You see how the bare mention
U||   of such a thing as our deaths has overcome him.”
U||   There was another sob behind the handkerchief, and the Morlands thought
U||   it now sounded very much like a smothered laugh.
U||   “As I was saying, ma’am,” continued Mrs. Watkinson, “we never give
U||   parties. We leave all sinful things to the vain and foolish. My
U||   daughter Jane has been telling me, that she heard this morning of a
U||   party that is going on to-night at the widow St. Leonard’s. It is only
U||   fifteen years since her husband died. He was carried off with a three
U||   days’ illness, but two months after they were married. I have had a
U||   domestic that lived with them at the time, so I know all about it. And
U||   there she is now, living in an elegant house, and riding in her
U||   carriage, and dressing and dashing, and giving parties, and enjoying
U||   life, as she calls it. Poor creature, how I pity her! Thank heaven,
U||   nobody that I know goes to her parties. If they did I would never wish
U||   to see them again in my house. It is an encouragement to folly and
U||   nonsense—and folly and nonsense are sinful. Do not you think so,
U||   ma’am?”
U||   “If carried too far they may certainly become so,” replied Mrs.
U||   Morland.
U||   “We have heard,” said Edward, “that Mrs. St. Leonard, though one of the
U||   ornaments of the gay world, has a kind heart, a beneficent spirit and a
U||   liberal hand.”
U||   “I know very little about her,” replied Mrs. Watkinson, drawing up her
U||   head, “and I have not the least desire to know any more. It is well she
U||   has no children; they’d be lost sheep if brought up in her fold. For my
U||   part, ma’am,” she continued, turning to Mrs. Morland, “I am quite
U||   satisfied with the quiet joys of a happy home. And no mother has the
U||   least business with any other pleasures. My innocent babes know nothing
U||   about plays, and balls, and parties; and they never shall. Do they look
U||   as if they had been accustomed to a life of pleasure?”
U||   They certainly did not! for when the Morlands took a glance at them,
U||   they thought they had never seen youthful faces that were less gay, and
U||   indeed less prepossessing.
U||   There was not a good feature or a pleasant expression among them all.
U||   Edward Morland recollected his having often read “that childhood is
U||   always lovely.” But he saw that the juvenile Watkinsons were an
U||   exception to the rule.
U||   “The first duty of a mother is to her children,” repeated Mrs.
U||   Watkinson. “Till nine o’clock, my daughter Jane and myself are occupied
U||   every evening in hearing the lessons that they have learned for
U||   to-morrow’s school. Before that hour we can receive no visitors, and we
U||   never have company to tea, as that would interfere too much with our
U||   duties. We had just finished hearing these lessons when you arrived.
U||   Afterwards the children are permitted to indulge themselves in rational
U||   play, for I permit no amusement that is not also instructive. My
U||   children are so well trained, that even when alone their sports are
U||   always serious.”
U||   Two of the boys glanced slyly at each other, with what Edward Morland
U||   comprehended as an expression of pitch-penny and marbles.
U||   “They are now engaged at their game of astronomy,” continued Mrs.
U||   Watkinson. “They have also a sort of geography cards, and a set of
U||   mathematical cards. It is a blessed discovery, the invention of these
U||   educationary games; so that even the play-time of children can be
U||   turned to account. And you have no idea, ma’am, how they enjoy them.”
U||   Just then the boy Joseph rose from the table, and stalking up to Mrs.
U||   Watkinson, said to her, “Mamma, please to whip me.”
U||   At this unusual request the visitors looked much amazed, and Mrs.
U||   Watkinson replied to him, “Whip you, my best Joseph—for what cause? I
U||   have not seen you do anything wrong this evening, and you know my
U||   anxiety induces me to watch my children all the time.”
U||   “You could not see me,” answered Joseph, “for I have not done anything
U||   very wrong. But I have had a bad thought, and you know Mr. Ironrule
U||   says that a fault imagined is just as wicked as a fault committed.”
U||   “You see, ma’am, what a good memory he has,” said Mrs. Watkinson aside
U||   to Mrs. Morland. “But my best Joseph, you make your mother tremble.
U||   What fault have you imagined? What was your bad thought?”
U||   “Ay,” said another boy, “what’s your thought like?”
U||   “My thought,” said Joseph, “was ‘Confound all astronomy, and I could
U||   see the man hanged that made this game.’”
U||   “Oh! my child,” exclaimed the mother, stopping her ears, “I am indeed
U||   shocked. I am glad you repented so immediately.”
U||   “Yes,” returned Joseph, “but I am afraid my repentance won’t last. If I
U||   am not whipped, I may have these bad thoughts whenever I play at
U||   astronomy, and worse still at the geography game. Whip me, ma, and
U||   punish me as I deserve. There’s the rattan in the corner: I’ll bring it
U||   to you myself.”
U||   “Excellent boy!” said his mother. “You know I always pardon my children
U||   when they are so candid as to confess their faults.”
U||   “So you do,” said Joseph, “but a whipping will cure me better.”
U||   “I cannot resolve to punish so conscientious a child,” said Mrs.
U||   Watkinson.
U||   “Shall I take the trouble off your hands?” inquired Edward, losing all
U||   patience in his disgust at the sanctimonious hypocrisy of this young
U||   Blifil. “It is such a rarity for a boy to request a whipping, that so
U||   remarkable a desire ought by all means to be gratified.”
U||   Joseph turned round and made a face at him.
U||   “Give me the rattan,” said Edward, half laughing, and offering to take
U||   it out of his hand. “I’ll use it to your full satisfaction.”
U||   The boy thought it most prudent to stride off and return to the table,
U||   and ensconce himself among his brothers and sisters; some of whom were
U||   staring with stupid surprise; others were whispering and giggling in
U||   the hope of seeing Joseph get a real flogging.
U||   Mrs. Watkinson having bestowed a bitter look on Edward, hastened to
U||   turn the attention of his mother to something else. “Mrs. Morland,”
U||   said she, “allow me to introduce you to my youngest hope.” She pointed
U||   to a sleepy boy about five years old, who with head thrown back and
U||   mouth wide open, was slumbering in his chair.
U||   Mrs. Watkinson’s children were of that uncomfortable species who never
U||   go to bed; at least never without all manner of resistance. All her
U||   boasted authority was inadequate to compel them; they never would
U||   confess themselves sleepy; always wanted to “sit up,” and there was a
U||   nightly scene of scolding, coaxing, threatening and manoeuvring to get
U||   them off.
U||   “I declare,” said Mrs. Watkinson, “dear Benny is almost asleep. Shake
U||   him up, Christopher. I want him to speak a speech. His schoolmistress
U||   takes great pains in teaching her little pupils to speak, and stands up
U||   herself and shows them how.”
U||   The child having been shaken up hard (two or three others helping
U||   Christopher), rubbed his eyes and began to whine. His mother went to
U||   him, took him on her lap, hushed him up, and began to coax him. This
U||   done, she stood him on his feet before Mrs. Morland, and desired him to
U||   speak a speech for the company. The child put his thumb into his mouth,
U||   and remained silent.
U||   “Ma,” said Jane Watkinson, “you had better tell him what speech to
U||   speak.”
U||   “Speak Cato or Plato,” said his mother. “Which do you call it? Come
U||   now, Benny—how does it begin? ‘You are quite right and reasonable,
U||   Plato.’ That’s it.”
U||   “Speak Lucius,” said his sister Jane. “Come now, Benny—say ‘your
U||   thoughts are turned on peace.’”
U||   The little boy looked very much as if they were not, and as if
U||   meditating an outbreak.
U||   “No, no!” exclaimed Christopher, “let him say Hamlet. Come now,
U||   Benny—‘To be or not to be.’”
U||   “It ain’t to be at all,” cried Benny, “and I won’t speak the least bit
U||   of it for any of you. I hate that speech!”
U||   “Only see his obstinacy,” said the solemn Joseph. “And is he to be
U||   given up to?”
U||   “Speak anything, Benny,” said Mrs. Watkinson, “anything so that it is
U||   only a speech.”
U||   All the Watkinson voices now began to clamor violently at the obstinate
U||   child—“Speak a speech! speak a speech! speak a speech!” But they had no
U||   more effect than the reiterated exhortations with which nurses confuse
U||   the poor heads of babies, when they require them to “shake a
U||   day-day—shake a day-day!”
U||   Mrs. Morland now interfered, and begged that the sleepy little boy
U||   might be excused; on which he screamed out that “he wasn’t sleepy at
U||   all, and would not go to bed ever.”
U||   “I never knew any of my children behave so before,” said Mrs.
U||   Watkinson. “They are always models of obedience, ma’am. A look is
U||   sufficient for them. And I must say that they have in every way
U||   profited by the education we are giving them. It is not our way, ma’am,
U||   to waste our money in parties and fooleries, and fine furniture and
U||   fine clothes, and rich food, and all such abominations. Our first duty
U||   is to our children, and to make them learn everything that is taught in
U||   the schools. If they go wrong, it will not be for want of education.
U||   Hester, my dear, come and talk to Miss Morland in French.”
U||   Hester (unlike her little brother that would not speak a speech)
U||   stepped boldly forward, and addressed Caroline Morland with:
U||   “Parlez-vous Français, mademoiselle? Comment se va madame votre mère?
U||   Aimez-vous la musique? Aimez-vous la danse? Bon jour—bon soir—bon
U||   repos. Comprenez-vous?”
U||   To this tirade, uttered with great volubility, Miss Morland made no
U||   other reply than, “Oui—je comprens.”
U||   “Very well, Hester—very well indeed,” said Mrs. Watkinson. “You see,
U||   ma’am,” turning to Mrs. Morland, “how very fluent she is in French; and
U||   she has only been learning eleven quarters.”
U||   After considerable whispering between Jane and her mother, the former
U||   withdrew, and sent in by the Irish girl a waiter with a basket of soda
U||   biscuit, a pitcher of water, and some glasses. Mrs. Watkinson invited
U||   her guests to consider themselves at home and help themselves freely,
U||   saying: “We never let cakes, sweetmeats, confectionery, or any such
U||   things enter the house, as they would be very unwholesome for the
U||   children, and it would be sinful to put temptation in their way. I am
U||   sure, ma’am, you will agree with me that the plainest food is the best
U||   for everybody. People that want nice things may go to parties for them;
U||   but they will never get any with me.”
U||   When the collation was over, and every child provided with a biscuit,
U||   Mrs. Watkinson said to Mrs. Morland: “Now, ma’am, you shall have some
U||   music from my daughter Jane, who is one of Mr. Bangwhanger’s best
U||   scholars.”
U||   Jane Watkinson sat down to the piano and commenced a powerful piece of
U||   six mortal pages, which she played out of time and out of tune; but
U||   with tremendous force of hands; notwithstanding which, it had, however,
U||   the good effect of putting most of the children to sleep.
U||   To the Morlands the evening had seemed already five hours long. Still
U||   it was only half past ten when Jane was in the midst of her piece. The
U||   guests had all tacitly determined that it would be best not to let Mrs.
U||   Watkinson know their intention to go directly from her house to Mrs.
U||   St. Leonard’s party; and the arrival of their carriage would have been
U||   the signal of departure, even if Jane’s piece had not reached its
U||   termination. They stole glances at the clock on the mantel. It wanted
U||   but a quarter of eleven, when Jane rose from the piano, and was
U||   congratulated by her mother on the excellence of her music. Still no
U||   carriage was heard to stop; no doorbell was heard to ring. Mrs. Morland
U||   expressed her fears that the coachman had forgotten to come for them.
U||   “Has he been paid for bringing you here?” asked Mrs. Watkinson.
U||   “I paid him when we came to the door,” said Edward. “I thought perhaps
U||   he might want the money for some purpose before he came for us.”
U||   “That was very kind in you, sir,” said Mrs. Watkinson, “but not very
U||   wise. There’s no dependence on any coachman; and perhaps as he may be
U||   sure of business enough this rainy night he may never come at all—being
U||   already paid for bringing you here.”
U||   Now, the truth was that the coachman had come at the appointed time,
U||   but the noise of Jane’s piano had prevented his arrival being heard in
U||   the back parlor. The Irish girl had gone to the door when he rang the
U||   bell, and recognized in him what she called “an ould friend.” Just then
U||   a lady and gentleman who had been caught in the rain came running
U||   along, and seeing a carriage drawing up at a door, the gentleman
U||   inquired of the driver if he could not take them to Rutgers Place. The
U||   driver replied that he had just come for two ladies and a gentleman
U||   whom he had brought from the Astor House.
U||   “Indeed and Patrick,” said the girl who stood at the door, “if I was
U||   you I’d be after making another penny to-night. Miss Jane is pounding
U||   away at one of her long music pieces, and it won’t be over before you
U||   have time to get to Rutgers and back again. And if you do make them
U||   wait awhile, where’s the harm? They’ve a dry roof over their heads, and
U||   I warrant it’s not the first waiting they’ve ever had in their lives;
U||   and it won’t be the last neither.”
U||   “Exactly so,” said the gentleman; and regardless of the propriety of
U||   first sending to consult the persons who had engaged the carriage, he
U||   told his wife to step in, and following her instantly himself, they
U||   drove away to Rutgers Place.
U||   Reader, if you were ever detained in a strange house by the non-arrival
U||   of your carriage, you will easily understand the excessive annoyance of
U||   finding that you are keeping a family out of their beds beyond their
U||   usual hour. And in this case, there was a double grievance; the guests
U||   being all impatience to get off to a better place. The children, all
U||   crying when wakened from their sleep, were finally taken to bed by two
U||   servant maids, and Jane Watkinson, who never came back again. None were
U||   left but Hester, the great French scholar, who, being one of those
U||   young imps that seem to have the faculty of living without sleep, sat
U||   bolt upright with her eyes wide open, watching the uncomfortable
U||   visitors.
U||   The Morlands felt as if they could bear it no longer, and Edward
U||   proposed sending for another carriage to the nearest livery stable.
U||   “We don’t keep a man now,” said Mrs. Watkinson, who sat nodding in the
U||   rocking-chair, attempting now and then a snatch of conversation, and
U||   saying “ma’am” still more frequently than usual. “Men servants are
U||   dreadful trials, ma’am, and we gave them up three years ago. And I
U||   don’t know how Mary or Katy are to go out this stormy night in search
U||   of a livery stable.”
U||   “On no consideration could I allow the women to do so,” replied Edward.
U||   “If you will oblige me by the loan of an umbrella, I will go myself.”
U||   Accordingly he set out on this business, but was unsuccessful at two
U||   livery stables, the carriages being all out. At last he found one, and
U||   was driven in it to Mr. Watkinson’s house, where his mother and sister
U||   were awaiting him, all quite ready, with their calashes and shawls on.
U||   They gladly took their leave; Mrs. Watkinson rousing herself to hope
U||   they had spent a pleasant evening, and that they would come and pass
U||   another with her on their return to New York. In such cases how
U||   difficult it is to reply even with what are called “words of course.”
U||   A kitchen lamp was brought to light them to the door, the entry lamp
U||   having long since been extinguished. Fortunately the rain had ceased;
U||   the stars began to reappear, and the Morlands, when they found
U||   themselves in the carriage and on their way to Mrs. St. Leonard’s, felt
U||   as if they could breathe again. As may be supposed, they freely
U||   discussed the annoyances of the evening; but now those troubles were
U||   over they felt rather inclined to be merry about them.
U||   “Dear mother,” said Edward, “how I pitied you for having to endure Mrs.
U||   Watkinson’s perpetual ‘ma’aming’ and ‘ma’aming’; for I know you dislike
U||   the word.”
U||   “I wish,” said Caroline, “I was not so prone to be taken with
U||   ridiculous recollections. But really to-night I could not get that old
U||   foolish child’s play out of my head—
U||   Here come three knights out of Spain
U||   A-courting of your daughter Jane.”
U||   “I shall certainly never be one of those Spanish knights,” said Edward.
U||   “Her daughter Jane is in no danger of being ruled by any ‘flattering
U||   tongue’ of mine. But what a shame for us to be talking of them in this
U||   manner.”
U||   They drove to Mrs. St. Leonard’s, hoping to be yet in time to pass half
U||   an hour there; though it was now near twelve o’clock and summer parties
U||   never continue to a very late hour. But as they came into the street in
U||   which she lived they were met by a number of coaches on their way home,
U||   and on reaching the door of her brilliantly lighted mansion, they saw
U||   the last of the guests driving off in the last of the carriages, and
U||   several musicians coming down the steps with their instruments in their
U||   hands.
U||   “So there has been a dance, then!” sighed Caroline. “Oh, what we have
U||   missed! It is really too provoking.”
U||   “So it is,” said Edward; “but remember that to-morrow morning we set
U||   off for Niagara.”
U||   “I will leave a note for Mrs. St. Leonard,” said his mother,
U||   “explaining that we were detained at Mrs. Watkinson’s by our coachman
U||   disappointing us. Let us console ourselves with the hope of seeing more
U||   of this lady on our return. And now, dear Caroline, you must draw a
U||   moral from the untoward events of to-day. When you are mistress of a
U||   house, and wish to show civility to strangers, let the invitation be
U||   always accompanied with a frank disclosure of what they are to expect.
U||   And if you cannot conveniently invite company to meet them, tell them
U||   at once that you will not insist on their keeping their engagement with
U||   you if anything offers afterwards that they think they would prefer;
U||   provided only that they apprize you in time of the change in their
U||   plan.”
U||   “Oh, mamma,” replied Caroline, “you may be sure I shall always take
U||   care not to betray my visitors into an engagement which they may have
U||   cause to regret, particularly if they are strangers whose time is
U||   limited. I shall certainly, as you say, tell them not to consider
U||   themselves bound to me if they afterwards receive an invitation which
U||   promises them more enjoyment. It will be a long while before I forget,
U||   the Watkinson evening.”

U||TITBOTTOM’S SPECTACLES[47][14]
U||   By George William Curtis (1824–1892)
U||   In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
U||   Prue and I do not entertain much; our means forbid it. In truth, other
U||   people entertain for us. We enjoy that hospitality of which no account
U||   is made. We see the show, and hear the music, and smell the flowers of
U||   great festivities, tasting as it were the drippings from rich dishes.
U||   Our own dinner service is remarkably plain, our dinners, even on state
U||   occasions, are strictly in keeping, and almost our only guest is
U||   Titbottom. I buy a handful of roses as I come up from the office,
U||   perhaps, and Prue arranges them so prettily in a glass dish for the
U||   centre of the table that even when I have hurried out to see Aurelia
U||   step into her carriage to go out to dine, I have thought that the
U||   bouquet she carried was not more beautiful because it was more costly.
U||   I grant that it was more harmonious with her superb beauty and her rich
U||   attire. And I have no doubt that if Aurelia knew the old man, whom she
U||   must have seen so often watching her, and his wife, who ornaments her
U||   sex with as much sweetness, although with less splendor, than Aurelia
U||   herself, she would also acknowledge that the nosegay of roses was as
U||   fine and fit upon their table as her own sumptuous bouquet is for
U||   herself. I have that faith in the perception of that lovely lady. It is
U||   at least my habit—I hope I may say, my nature, to believe the best of
U||   people, rather than the worst. If I thought that all this sparkling
U||   setting of beauty—this fine fashion—these blazing jewels and lustrous
U||   silks and airy gauzes, embellished with gold-threaded embroidery and
U||   wrought in a thousand exquisite elaborations, so that I cannot see one
U||   of those lovely girls pass me by without thanking God for the vision—if
U||   I thought that this was all, and that underneath her lace flounces and
U||   diamond bracelets Aurelia was a sullen, selfish woman, then I should
U||   turn sadly homewards, for I should see that her jewels were flashing
U||   scorn upon the object they adorned, and that her laces were of a more
U||   exquisite loveliness than the woman whom they merely touched with a
U||   superficial grace. It would be like a gaily decorated mausoleum—bright
U||   to see, but silent and dark within.
U||   “Great excellences, my dear Prue,” I sometimes allow myself to say,
U||   “lie concealed in the depths of character, like pearls at the bottom of
U||   the sea. Under the laughing, glancing surface, how little they are
U||   suspected! Perhaps love is nothing else than the sight of them by one
U||   person. Hence every man’s mistress is apt to be an enigma to everybody
U||   else. I have no doubt that when Aurelia is engaged, people will say
U||   that she is a most admirable girl, certainly; but they cannot
U||   understand why any man should be in love with her. As if it were at all
U||   necessary that they should! And her lover, like a boy who finds a pearl
U||   in the public street, and wonders as much that others did not see it as
U||   that he did, will tremble until he knows his passion is returned;
U||   feeling, of course, that the whole world must be in love with this
U||   paragon who cannot possibly smile upon anything so unworthy as he.”
U||   “I hope, therefore, my dear Mrs. Prue,” I continue to say to my wife,
U||   who looks up from her work regarding me with pleased pride, as if I
U||   were such an irresistible humorist, “you will allow me to believe that
U||   the depth may be calm although the surface is dancing. If you tell me
U||   that Aurelia is but a giddy girl, I shall believe that you think so.
U||   But I shall know, all the while, what profound dignity, and sweetness,
U||   and peace lie at the foundation of her character.”
U||   I say such things to Titbottom during the dull season at the office.
U||   And I have known him sometimes to reply with a kind of dry, sad humor,
U||   not as if he enjoyed the joke, but as if the joke must be made, that he
U||   saw no reason why I should be dull because the season was so.
U||   “And what do I know of Aurelia or any other girl?” he says to me with
U||   that abstracted air. “I, whose Aurelias were of another century and
U||   another zone.”
U||   Then he falls into a silence which it seems quite profane to interrupt.
U||   But as we sit upon our high stools at the desk opposite each other, I
U||   leaning upon my elbows and looking at him; he, with sidelong face,
U||   glancing out of the window, as if it commanded a boundless landscape,
U||   instead of a dim, dingy office court, I cannot refrain from saying:
U||   “Well!”
U||   He turns slowly, and I go chatting on—a little too loquacious, perhaps,
U||   about those young girls. But I know that Titbottom regards such an
U||   excess as venial, for his sadness is so sweet that you could believe it
U||   the reflection of a smile from long, long years ago.
U||   One day, after I had been talking for a long time, and we had put up
U||   our books, and were preparing to leave, he stood for some time by the
U||   window, gazing with a drooping intentness, as if he really saw
U||   something more than the dark court, and said slowly:
U||   “Perhaps you would have different impressions of things if you saw them
U||   through my spectacles.”
U||   There was no change in his expression. He still looked from the window,
U||   and I said:
U||   “Titbottom, I did not know that you used glasses. I have never seen you
U||   wearing spectacles.”
U||   “No, I don’t often wear them. I am not very fond of looking through
U||   them. But sometimes an irresistible necessity compels me to put them
U||   on, and I cannot help seeing.” Titbottom sighed.
U||   “Is it so grievous a fate, to see?” inquired I.
U||   “Yes; through my spectacles,” he said, turning slowly and looking at me
U||   with wan solemnity.
U||   It grew dark as we stood in the office talking, and taking our hats we
U||   went out together. The narrow street of business was deserted. The
U||   heavy iron shutters were gloomily closed over the windows. From one or
U||   two offices struggled the dim gleam of an early candle, by whose light
U||   some perplexed accountant sat belated, and hunting for his error. A
U||   careless clerk passed, whistling. But the great tide of life had ebbed.
U||   We heard its roar far away, and the sound stole into that silent street
U||   like the murmur of the ocean into an inland dell.
U||   “You will come and dine with us, Titbottom?”
U||   He assented by continuing to walk with me, and I think we were both
U||   glad when we reached the house, and Prue came to meet us, saying:
U||   “Do you know I hoped you would bring Mr. Titbottom to dine?”
U||   Titbottom smiled gently, and answered:
U||   “He might have brought his spectacles with him, and I have been a
U||   happier man for it.”
U||   Prue looked a little puzzled.
U||   “My dear,” I said, “you must know that our friend, Mr. Titbottom, is
U||   the happy possessor of a pair of wonderful spectacles. I have never
U||   seen them, indeed; and, from what he says, I should be rather afraid of
U||   being seen by them. Most short-sighted persons are very glad to have
U||   the help of glasses; but Mr. Titbottom seems to find very little
U||   pleasure in his.”
U||   “It is because they make him too far-sighted, perhaps,” interrupted
U||   Prue quietly, as she took the silver soup-ladle from the sideboard.
U||   We sipped our wine after dinner, and Prue took her work. Can a man be
U||   too far-sighted? I did not ask the question aloud. The very tone in
U||   which Prue had spoken convinced me that he might.
U||   “At least,” I said, “Mr. Titbottom will not refuse to tell us the
U||   history of his mysterious spectacles. I have known plenty of magic in
U||   eyes”—and I glanced at the tender blue eyes of Prue—“but I have not
U||   heard of any enchanted glasses.”
U||   “Yet you must have seen the glass in which your wife looks every
U||   morning, and I take it that glass must be daily enchanted.” said
U||   Titbottom, with a bow of quaint respect to my wife.
U||   I do not think I have seen such a blush upon Prue’s cheek since—well,
U||   since a great many years ago.
U||   “I will gladly tell you the history of my spectacles,” began Titbottom.
U||   “It is very simple; and I am not at all sure that a great many other
U||   people have not a pair of the same kind. I have never, indeed, heard of
U||   them by the gross, like those of our young friend, Moses, the son of
U||   the Vicar of Wakefield. In fact, I think a gross would be quite enough
U||   to supply the world. It is a kind of article for which the demand does
U||   not increase with use. If we should all wear spectacles like mine, we
U||   should never smile any more. Oh—I am not quite sure—we should all be
U||   very happy.”
U||   “A very important difference,” said Prue, counting her stitches.
U||   “You know my grandfather Titbottom was a West Indian. A large
U||   proprietor, and an easy man, he basked in the tropical sun, leading his
U||   quiet, luxurious life. He lived much alone, and was what people call
U||   eccentric, by which I understand that he was very much himself, and,
U||   refusing the influence of other people, they had their little revenges,
U||   and called him names. It is a habit not exclusively tropical. I think I
U||   have seen the same thing even in this city. But he was greatly
U||   beloved—my bland and bountiful grandfather. He was so large-hearted and
U||   open-handed. He was so friendly, and thoughtful, and genial, that even
U||   his jokes had the air of graceful benedictions. He did not seem to grow
U||   old, and he was one of those who never appear to have been very young.
U||   He flourished in a perennial maturity, an immortal middle-age.
U||   “My grandfather lived upon one of the small islands, St. Kit’s,
U||   perhaps, and his domain extended to the sea. His house, a rambling West
U||   Indian mansion, was surrounded with deep, spacious piazzas, covered
U||   with luxurious lounges, among which one capacious chair was his
U||   peculiar seat. They tell me he used sometimes to sit there for the
U||   whole day, his great, soft, brown eyes fastened upon the sea, watching
U||   the specks of sails that flashed upon the horizon, while the evanescent
U||   expressions chased each other over his placid face, as if it reflected
U||   the calm and changing sea before him. His morning costume was an ample
U||   dressing-gown of gorgeously flowered silk, and his morning was very apt
U||   to last all day.
U||   “He rarely read, but he would pace the great piazza for hours, with his
U||   hands sunken in the pockets of his dressing-gown, and an air of sweet
U||   reverie, which any author might be very happy to produce.
U||   “Society, of course, he saw little. There was some slight apprehension
U||   that if he were bidden to social entertainments he might forget his
U||   coat, or arrive without some other essential part of his dress; and
U||   there is a sly tradition in the Titbottom family that, having been
U||   invited to a ball in honor of the new governor of the island, my
U||   grandfather Titbottom sauntered into the hall towards midnight, wrapped
U||   in the gorgeous flowers of his dressing-gown, and with his hands buried
U||   in the pockets, as usual. There was great excitement, and immense
U||   deprecation of gubernatorial ire. But it happened that the governor and
U||   my grandfather were old friends, and there was no offense. But as they
U||   were conversing together, one of the distressed managers cast indignant
U||   glances at the brilliant costume of my grandfather, who summoned him,
U||   and asked courteously:
U||   “‘Did you invite me or my coat?’
U||   “‘You, in a proper coat,’ replied the manager.
U||   “The governor smiled approvingly, and looked at my grandfather.
U||   “‘My friend,” said he to the manager, ‘I beg your pardon, I forgot.’
U||   “The next day my grandfather was seen promenading in full ball dress
U||   along the streets of the little town.
U||   “‘They ought to know,’ said he, ‘that I have a proper coat, and that
U||   not contempt nor poverty, but forgetfulness, sent me to a ball in my
U||   dressing-gown.’
U||   “He did not much frequent social festivals after this failure, but he
U||   always told the story with satisfaction and a quiet smile.
U||   “To a stranger, life upon those little islands is uniform even to
U||   weariness. But the old native dons like my grandfather ripen in the
U||   prolonged sunshine, like the turtle upon the Bahama banks, nor know of
U||   existence more desirable. Life in the tropics I take to be a placid
U||   torpidity. During the long, warm mornings of nearly half a century, my
U||   grandfather Titbottom had sat in his dressing-gown and gazed at the
U||   sea. But one calm June day, as he slowly paced the piazza after
U||   breakfast, his dreamy glance was arrested by a little vessel, evidently
U||   nearing the shore. He called for his spyglass, and surveying the craft,
U||   saw that she came from the neighboring island. She glided smoothly,
U||   slowly, over the summer sea. The warm morning air was sweet with
U||   perfumes, and silent with heat. The sea sparkled languidly, and the
U||   brilliant blue hung cloudlessly over. Scores of little island vessels
U||   had my grandfather seen come over the horizon, and cast anchor in the
U||   port. Hundreds of summer mornings had the white sails flashed and
U||   faded, like vague faces through forgotten dreams. But this time he laid
U||   down the spyglass, and leaned against a column of the piazza, and
U||   watched the vessel with an intentness that he could not explain. She
U||   came nearer and nearer, a graceful spectre in the dazzling morning.
U||   “‘Decidedly I must step down and see about that vessel,’ said my
U||   grandfather Titbottom.
U||   “He gathered his ample dressing-gown about him, and stepped from the
U||   piazza with no other protection from the sun than the little smoking
U||   cap upon his head. His face wore a calm, beaming smile, as if he
U||   approved of all the world. He was not an old man, but there was almost
U||   a patriarchal pathos in his expression as he sauntered along in the
U||   sunshine towards the shore. A group of idle gazers was collected to
U||   watch the arrival. The little vessel furled her sails and drifted
U||   slowly landward, and as she was of very light draft, she came close to
U||   the shelving shore. A long plank was put out from her side, and the
U||   debarkation commenced. My grandfather Titbottom stood looking on to see
U||   the passengers descend. There were but a few of them, and mostly
U||   traders from the neighboring island. But suddenly the face of a young
U||   girl appeared over the side of the vessel, and she stepped upon the
U||   plank to descend. My grandfather Titbottom instantly advanced, and
U||   moving briskly reached the top of the plank at the same moment, and
U||   with the old tassel of his cap flashing in the sun, and one hand in the
U||   pocket of his dressing gown, with the other he handed the young lady
U||   carefully down the plank. That young lady was afterwards my grandmother
U||   Titbottom.
U||   “And so, over the gleaming sea which he had watched so long, and which
U||   seemed thus to reward his patient gaze, came his bride that sunny
U||   morning.
U||   “‘Of course we are happy,’ he used to say: ‘For you are the gift of the
U||   sun I have loved so long and so well.’ And my grandfather Titbottom
U||   would lay his hand so tenderly upon the golden hair of his young bride,
U||   that you could fancy him a devout Parsee caressing sunbeams.
U||   “There were endless festivities upon occasion of the marriage; and my
U||   grandfather did not go to one of them in his dressing-gown. The gentle
U||   sweetness of his wife melted every heart into love and sympathy. He was
U||   much older than she, without doubt. But age, as he used to say with a
U||   smile of immortal youth, is a matter of feeling, not of years. And if,
U||   sometimes, as she sat by his side upon the piazza, her fancy looked
U||   through her eyes upon that summer sea and saw a younger lover, perhaps
U||   some one of those graceful and glowing heroes who occupy the foreground
U||   of all young maidens’ visions by the sea, yet she could not find one
U||   more generous and gracious, nor fancy one more worthy and loving than
U||   my grandfather Titbottom. And if in the moonlit midnight, while he lay
U||   calmly sleeping, she leaned out of the window and sank into vague
U||   reveries of sweet possibility, and watched the gleaming path of the
U||   moonlight upon the water, until the dawn glided over it—it was only
U||   that mood of nameless regret and longing, which underlies all human
U||   happiness,—or it was the vision of that life of society, which she had
U||   never seen, but of which she had often read, and which looked very fair
U||   and alluring across the sea to a girlish imagination which knew that it
U||   should never know that reality.
U||   “These West Indian years were the great days of the family,” said
U||   Titbottom, with an air of majestic and regal regret, pausing and musing
U||   in our little parlor, like a late Stuart in exile, remembering England.
U||   Prue raised her eyes from her work, and looked at him with a subdued
U||   admiration; for I have observed that, like the rest of her sex, she has
U||   a singular sympathy with the representative of a reduced family.
U||   Perhaps it is their finer perception which leads these tender-hearted
U||   women to recognize the divine right of social superiority so much more
U||   readily than we; and yet, much as Titbottom was enhanced in my wife’s
U||   admiration by the discovery that his dusky sadness of nature and
U||   expression was, as it were, the expiring gleam and late twilight of
U||   ancestral splendors, I doubt if Mr. Bourne would have preferred him for
U||   bookkeeper a moment sooner upon that account. In truth, I have
U||   observed, down town, that the fact of your ancestors doing nothing is
U||   not considered good proof that you can do anything. But Prue and her
U||   sex regard sentiment more than action, and I understand easily enough
U||   why she is never tired of hearing me read of Prince Charlie. If
U||   Titbottom had been only a little younger, a little handsomer, a little
U||   more gallantly dressed—in fact, a little more of the Prince Charlie, I
U||   am sure her eyes would not have fallen again upon her work so
U||   tranquilly, as he resumed his story.
U||   “I can remember my grandfather Titbottom, although I was a very young
U||   child, and he was a very old man. My young mother and my young
U||   grandmother are very distinct figures in my memory, ministering to the
U||   old gentleman, wrapped in his dressing-gown, and seated upon the
U||   piazza. I remember his white hair and his calm smile, and how, not long
U||   before he died, he called me to him, and laying his hand upon my head,
U||   said to me:
U||   “My child, the world is not this great sunny piazza, nor life the fairy
U||   stories which the women tell you here as you sit in their laps. I shall
U||   soon be gone, but I want to leave with you some memento of my love for
U||   you, and I know nothing more valuable than these spectacles, which your
U||   grandmother brought from her native island, when she arrived here one
U||   fine summer morning, long ago. I cannot quite tell whether, when you
U||   grow older, you will regard it as a gift of the greatest value or as
U||   something that you had been happier never to have possessed.’
U||   “‘But grandpapa, I am not short-sighted.’
U||   “‘My son, are you not human?’ said the old gentleman; and how shall I
U||   ever forget the thoughtful sadness with which, at the same time he
U||   handed me the spectacles.
U||   “Instinctively I put them on, and looked at my grandfather. But I saw
U||   no grandfather, no piazza, no flowered dressing-gown: I saw only a
U||   luxuriant palm-tree, waving broadly over a tranquil landscape. Pleasant
U||   homes clustered around it. Gardens teeming with fruit and flowers;
U||   flocks quietly feeding; birds wheeling and chirping. I heard children’s
U||   voices, and the low lullaby of happy mothers. The sound of cheerful
U||   singing came wafted from distant fields upon the light breeze. Golden
U||   harvests glistened out of sight, and I caught their rustling whisper of
U||   prosperity. A warm, mellow atmosphere bathed the whole. I have seen
U||   copies of the landscapes of the Italian painter Claude which seemed to
U||   me faint reminiscences of that calm and happy vision. But all this
U||   peace and prosperity seemed to flow from the spreading palm as from a
U||   fountain.
U||   “I do not know how long I looked, but I had, apparently, no power, as I
U||   had no will, to remove the spectacles. What a wonderful island must
U||   Nevis be, thought I, if people carry such pictures in their pockets,
U||   only by buying a pair of spectacles! What wonder that my dear
U||   grandmother Titbottom has lived such a placid life, and has blessed us
U||   all with her sunny temper, when she has lived surrounded by such images
U||   of peace.
U||   “My grandfather died. But still, in the warm morning sunshine upon the
U||   piazza, I felt his placid presence, and as I crawled into his great
U||   chair, and drifted on in reverie through the still, tropical day, it
U||   was as if his soft, dreamy eye had passed into my soul. My grandmother
U||   cherished his memory with tender regret. A violent passion of grief for
U||   his loss was no more possible than for the pensive decay of the year.
U||   We have no portrait of him, but I see always, when I remember him, that
U||   peaceful and luxuriant palm. And I think that to have known one good
U||   old man—one man who, through the chances and rubs of a long life, has
U||   carried his heart in his hand, like a palm branch, waving all discords
U||   into peace, helps our faith in God, in ourselves, and in each other,
U||   more than many sermons. I hardly know whether to be grateful to my
U||   grandfather for the spectacles; and yet when I remember that it is to
U||   them I owe the pleasant image of him which I cherish, I seem to myself
U||   sadly ungrateful.
U||   “Madam,” said Titbottom to Prue, solemnly, “my memory is a long and
U||   gloomy gallery, and only remotely, at its further end, do I see the
U||   glimmer of soft sunshine, and only there are the pleasant pictures
U||   hung. They seem to me very happy along whose gallery the sunlight
U||   streams to their very feet, striking all the pictured walls into
U||   unfading splendor.”
U||   Prue had laid her work in her lap, and as Titbottom paused a moment,
U||   and I turned towards her, I found her mild eyes fastened upon my face,
U||   and glistening with happy tears.
U||   “Misfortunes of many kinds came heavily upon the family after the head
U||   was gone. The great house was relinquished. My parents were both dead,
U||   and my grandmother had entire charge of me. But from the moment that I
U||   received the gift of the spectacles, I could not resist their
U||   fascination, and I withdrew into myself, and became a solitary boy.
U||   There were not many companions for me of my own age, and they gradually
U||   left me, or, at least, had not a hearty sympathy with me; for if they
U||   teased me I pulled out my spectacles and surveyed them so seriously
U||   that they acquired a kind of awe of me, and evidently regarded my
U||   grandfather’s gift as a concealed magical weapon which might be
U||   dangerously drawn upon them at any moment. Whenever, in our games,
U||   there were quarrels and high words, and I began to feel about my dress
U||   and to wear a grave look, they all took the alarm, and shouted, ‘Look
U||   out for Titbottom’s spectacles,’ and scattered like a flock of scared
U||   sheep.
U||   “Nor could I wonder at it. For, at first, before they took the alarm, I
U||   saw strange sights when I looked at them through the glasses. If two
U||   were quarrelling about a marble or a ball, I had only to go behind a
U||   tree where I was concealed and look at them leisurely. Then the scene
U||   changed, and no longer a green meadow with boys playing, but a spot
U||   which I did not recognize, and forms that made me shudder or smile. It
U||   was not a big boy bullying a little one, but a young wolf with
U||   glistening teeth and a lamb cowering before him; or, it was a dog
U||   faithful and famishing—or a star going slowly into eclipse—or a rainbow
U||   fading—or a flower blooming—or a sun rising—or a waning moon. The
U||   revelations of the spectacles determined my feeling for the boys, and
U||   for all whom I saw through them. No shyness, nor awkwardness, nor
U||   silence, could separate me from those who looked lovely as lilies to my
U||   illuminated eyes. If I felt myself warmly drawn to any one I struggled
U||   with the fierce desire of seeing him through the spectacles. I longed
U||   to enjoy the luxury of ignorant feeling, to love without knowing, to
U||   float like a leaf upon the eddies of life, drifted now to a sunny
U||   point, now to a solemn shade—now over glittering ripples, now over
U||   gleaming calms,—and not to determined ports, a trim vessel with an
U||   inexorable rudder.
U||   “But, sometimes, mastered after long struggles, I seized my spectacles
U||   and sauntered into the little town. Putting them to my eyes I peered
U||   into the houses and at the people who passed me. Here sat a family at
U||   breakfast, and I stood at the window looking in. O motley meal!
U||   fantastic vision! The good mother saw her lord sitting opposite, a
U||   grave, respectable being, eating muffins. But I saw only a bank-bill,
U||   more or less crumpled and tattered, marked with a larger or lesser
U||   figure. If a sharp wind blew suddenly, I saw it tremble and flutter; it
U||   was thin, flat, impalpable. I removed my glasses, and looked with my
U||   eyes at the wife. I could have smiled to see the humid tenderness with
U||   which she regarded her strange vis-à-vis. Is life only a game of
U||   blind-man’s-buff? of droll cross-purposes?
U||   “Or I put them on again, and looked at the wife. How many stout trees I
U||   saw,—how many tender flowers,—how many placid pools; yes, and how many
U||   little streams winding out of sight, shrinking before the large, hard,
U||   round eyes opposite, and slipping off into solitude and shade, with a
U||   low, inner song for their own solace. And in many houses I thought to
U||   see angels, nymphs, or at least, women, and could only find
U||   broomsticks, mops, or kettles, hurrying about, rattling, tinkling, in a
U||   state of shrill activity. I made calls upon elegant ladies, and after I
U||   had enjoyed the gloss of silk and the delicacy of lace, and the flash
U||   of jewels, I slipped on my spectacles, and saw a peacock’s feather,
U||   flounced and furbelowed and fluttering; or an iron rod, thin, sharp,
U||   and hard; nor could I possibly mistake the movement of the drapery for
U||   any flexibility of the thing draped,—or, mysteriously chilled, I saw a
U||   statue of perfect form, or flowing movement, it might be alabaster, or
U||   bronze, or marble,—but sadly often it was ice; and I knew that after it
U||   had shone a little, and frozen a few eyes with its despairing
U||   perfection, it could not be put away in the niches of palaces for
U||   ornament and proud family tradition, like the alabaster, or bronze, or
U||   marble statues, but would melt, and shrink, and fall coldly away in
U||   colorless and useless water, be absorbed in the earth and utterly
U||   forgotten.
U||   “But the true sadness was rather in seeing those who, not having the
U||   spectacles, thought that the iron rod was flexible, and the ice statue
U||   warm. I saw many a gallant heart, which seemed to me brave and loyal as
U||   the crusaders sent by genuine and noble faith to Syria and the
U||   sepulchre, pursuing, through days and nights, and a long life of
U||   devotion, the hope of lighting at least a smile in the cold eyes, if
U||   not a fire in the icy heart. I watched the earnest, enthusiastic
U||   sacrifice. I saw the pure resolve, the generous faith, the fine scorn
U||   of doubt, the impatience of suspicion. I watched the grace, the ardor,
U||   the glory of devotion. Through those strange spectacles how often I saw
U||   the noblest heart renouncing all other hope, all other ambition, all
U||   other life, than the possible love of some one of those statues. Ah!
U||   me, it was terrible, but they had not the love to give. The Parian face
U||   was so polished and smooth, because there was no sorrow upon the
U||   heart,—and, drearily often, no heart to be touched. I could not wonder
U||   that the noble heart of devotion was broken, for it had dashed itself
U||   against a stone. I wept, until my spectacles were dimmed for that
U||   hopeless sorrow; but there was a pang beyond tears for those icy
U||   statues.
U||   “Still a boy, I was thus too much a man in knowledge,—I did not
U||   comprehend the sights I was compelled to see. I used to tear my glasses
U||   away from my eyes, and, frightened at myself, run to escape my own
U||   consciousness. Reaching the small house where we then lived, I plunged
U||   into my grandmother’s room and, throwing myself upon the floor, buried
U||   my face in her lap; and sobbed myself to sleep with premature grief.
U||   But when I awakened, and felt her cool hand upon my hot forehead, and
U||   heard the low, sweet song, or the gentle story, or the tenderly told
U||   parable from the Bible, with which she tried to soothe me, I could not
U||   resist the mystic fascination that lured me, as I lay in her lap, to
U||   steal a glance at her through the spectacles.
U||   “Pictures of the Madonna have not her rare and pensive beauty. Upon the
U||   tranquil little islands her life had been eventless, and all the fine
U||   possibilities of her nature were like flowers that never bloomed.
U||   Placid were all her years; yet I have read of no heroine, of no woman
U||   great in sudden crises, that it did not seem to me she might have been.
U||   The wife and widow of a man who loved his own home better than the
U||   homes of others, I have yet heard of no queen, no belle, no imperial
U||   beauty, whom in grace, and brilliancy, and persuasive courtesy, she
U||   might not have surpassed.
U||   “Madam,” said Titbottom to my wife, whose heart hung upon his story;
U||   “your husband’s young friend, Aurelia, wears sometimes a camelia in her
U||   hair, and no diamond in the ball-room seems so costly as that perfect
U||   flower, which women envy, and for whose least and withered petal men
U||   sigh; yet, in the tropical solitudes of Brazil, how many a camelia bud
U||   drops from a bush that no eye has ever seen, which, had it flowered and
U||   been noticed, would have gilded all hearts with its memory.
U||   “When I stole these furtive glances at my grandmother, half fearing
U||   that they were wrong, I saw only a calm lake, whose shores were low,
U||   and over which the sky hung unbroken, so that the least star was
U||   clearly reflected. It had an atmosphere of solemn twilight
U||   tranquillity, and so completely did its unruffled surface blend with
U||   the cloudless, star-studded sky, that, when I looked through my
U||   spectacles at my grandmother, the vision seemed to me all heaven and
U||   stars. Yet, as I gazed and gazed, I felt what stately cities might well
U||   have been built upon those shores, and have flashed prosperity over the
U||   calm, like coruscations of pearls.
U||   “I dreamed of gorgeous fleets, silken sailed and blown by perfumed
U||   winds, drifting over those depthless waters and through those spacious
U||   skies. I gazed upon the twilight, the inscrutable silence, like a
U||   God-fearing discoverer upon a new, and vast, and dim sea, bursting upon
U||   him through forest glooms, and in the fervor of whose impassioned gaze,
U||   a millennial and poetic world arises, and man need no longer die to be
U||   happy.
U||   “My companions naturally deserted me, for I had grown wearily grave and
U||   abstracted: and, unable to resist the allurement of my spectacles, I
U||   was constantly lost in a world, of which those companions were part,
U||   yet of which they knew nothing. I grew cold and hard, almost morose;
U||   people seemed to me blind and unreasonable. They did the wrong thing.
U||   They called green, yellow; and black, white. Young men said of a girl,
U||   ‘What a lovely, simple creature!’ I looked, and there was only a
U||   glistening wisp of straw, dry and hollow. Or they said, ‘What a cold,
U||   proud beauty!’ I looked, and lo! a Madonna, whose heart held the world.
U||   Or they said, ‘What a wild, giddy girl!’ and I saw a glancing, dancing
U||   mountain stream, pure as the virgin snows whence it flowed, singing
U||   through sun and shade, over pearls and gold dust, slipping along
U||   unstained by weed, or rain, or heavy foot of cattle, touching the
U||   flowers with a dewy kiss,—a beam of grace, a happy song, a line of
U||   light, in the dim and troubled landscape.
U||   “My grandmother sent me to school, but I looked at the master, and saw
U||   that he was a smooth, round ferule—or an improper noun—or a vulgar
U||   fraction, and refused to obey him. Or he was a piece of string, a rag,
U||   a willow-wand, and I had a contemptuous pity. But one was a well of
U||   cool, deep water, and looking suddenly in, one day, I saw the stars. He
U||   gave me all my schooling. With him I used to walk by the sea, and, as
U||   we strolled and the waves plunged in long legions before us, I looked
U||   at him through the spectacles, and as his eye dilated with the
U||   boundless view, and his chest heaved with an impossible desire, I saw
U||   Xerxes and his army tossing and glittering, rank upon rank, multitude
U||   upon multitude, out of sight, but ever regularly advancing and with the
U||   confused roar of ceaseless music, prostrating themselves in abject
U||   homage. Or, as with arms outstretched and hair streaming on the wind,
U||   he chanted full lines of the resounding Iliad, I saw Homer pacing the
U||   AEgean sands in the Greek sunsets of forgotten times.
U||   “My grandmother died, and I was thrown into the world without
U||   resources, and with no capital but my spectacles. I tried to find
U||   employment, but men were shy of me. There was a vague suspicion that I
U||   was either a little crazed, or a good deal in league with the Prince of
U||   Darkness. My companions who would persist in calling a piece of painted
U||   muslin a fair and fragrant flower had no difficulty; success waited for
U||   them around every corner, and arrived in every ship. I tried to teach,
U||   for I loved children. But if anything excited my suspicion, and,
U||   putting on my spectacles, I saw that I was fondling a snake, or
U||   smelling at a bud with a worm in it, I sprang up in horror and ran
U||   away; or, if it seemed to me through the glasses that a cherub smiled
U||   upon me, or a rose was blooming in my buttonhole, then I felt myself
U||   imperfect and impure, not fit to be leading and training what was so
U||   essentially superior in quality to myself, and I kissed the children
U||   and left them weeping and wondering.
U||   “In despair I went to a great merchant on the island, and asked him to
U||   employ me.
U||   “‘My young friend,’ said he, ‘I understand that you have some singular
U||   secret, some charm, or spell, or gift, or something, I don’t know what,
U||   of which people are afraid. Now, you know, my dear,’ said the merchant,
U||   swelling up, and apparently prouder of his great stomach than of his
U||   large fortune, ‘I am not of that kind. I am not easily frightened. You
U||   may spare yourself the pain of trying to impose upon me. People who
U||   propose to come to time before I arrive, are accustomed to arise very
U||   early in the morning,’ said he, thrusting his thumbs in the armholes of
U||   his waistcoat, and spreading the fingers, like two fans, upon his
U||   bosom. ‘I think I have heard something of your secret. You have a pair
U||   of spectacles, I believe, that you value very much, because your
U||   grandmother brought them as a marriage portion to your grandfather.
U||   Now, if you think fit to sell me those spectacles, I will pay you the
U||   largest market price for glasses. What do you say?’
U||   “I told him that I had not the slightest idea of selling my spectacles.
U||   “‘My young friend means to eat them, I suppose,’ said he with a
U||   contemptuous smile.
U||   “I made no reply, but was turning to leave the office, when the
U||   merchant called after me—
U||   “‘My young friend, poor people should never suffer themselves to get
U||   into pets. Anger is an expensive luxury, in which only men of a certain
U||   income can indulge. A pair of spectacles and a hot temper are not the
U||   most promising capital for success in life, Master Titbottom.’
U||   “I said nothing, but put my hand upon the door to go out, when the
U||   merchant said more respectfully,—
U||   “‘Well, you foolish boy, if you will not sell your spectacles, perhaps
U||   you will agree to sell the use of them to me. That is, you shall only
U||   put them on when I direct you, and for my purposes. Hallo! you little
U||   fool!’ cried he impatiently, as he saw that I intended to make no
U||   reply.
U||   “But I had pulled out my spectacles, and put them on for my own
U||   purpose, and against his direction and desire. I looked at him, and saw
U||   a huge bald-headed wild boar, with gross chops and a leering eye—only
U||   the more ridiculous for the high-arched, gold-bowed spectacles, that
U||   straddled his nose. One of his fore hoofs was thrust into the safe,
U||   where his bills payable were hived, and the other into his pocket,
U||   among the loose change and bills there. His ears were pricked forward
U||   with a brisk, sensitive smartness. In a world where prize pork was the
U||   best excellence, he would have carried off all the premiums.
U||   “I stepped into the next office in the street, and a mild-faced, genial
U||   man, also a large and opulent merchant, asked me my business in such a
U||   tone, that I instantly looked through my spectacles, and saw a land
U||   flowing with milk and honey. There I pitched my tent, and stayed till
U||   the good man died, and his business was discontinued.
U||   “But while there,” said Titbottom, and his voice trembled away into a
U||   sigh, “I first saw Preciosa. Spite of the spectacles, I saw Preciosa.
U||   For days, for weeks, for months, I did not take my spectacles with me.
U||   I ran away from them, I threw them up on high shelves, I tried to make
U||   up my mind to throw them into the sea, or down the well. I could not, I
U||   would not, I dared not look at Preciosa through the spectacles. It was
U||   not possible for me deliberately to destroy them; but I awoke in the
U||   night, and could almost have cursed my dear old grandfather for his
U||   gift. I escaped from the office, and sat for whole days with Preciosa.
U||   I told her the strange things I had seen with my mystic glasses. The
U||   hours were not enough for the wild romances which I raved in her ear.
U||   She listened, astonished and appalled. Her blue eyes turned upon me
U||   with a sweet deprecation. She clung to me, and then withdrew, and fled
U||   fearfully from the room. But she could not stay away. She could not
U||   resist my voice, in whose tones burned all the love that filled my
U||   heart and brain. The very effort to resist the desire of seeing her as
U||   I saw everybody else, gave a frenzy and an unnatural tension to my
U||   feeling and my manner. I sat by her side, looking into her eyes,
U||   smoothing her hair, folding her to my heart, which was sunken and
U||   deep—why not forever?—in that dream of peace. I ran from her presence,
U||   and shouted, and leaped with joy, and sat the whole night through,
U||   thrilled into happiness by the thought of her love and loveliness, like
U||   a wind-harp, tightly strung, and answering the airiest sigh of the
U||   breeze with music. Then came calmer days—the conviction of deep love
U||   settled upon our lives—as after the hurrying, heaving days of spring,
U||   comes the bland and benignant summer.
U||   “‘It is no dream, then, after all, and we are happy,’ I said to her,
U||   one day; and there came no answer, for happiness is speechless.
U||   “We are happy then,” I said to myself, “there is no excitement now. How
U||   glad I am that I can now look at her through my spectacles.”
U||   “I feared lest some instinct should warn me to beware. I escaped from
U||   her arms, and ran home and seized the glasses and bounded back again to
U||   Preciosa. As I entered the room I was heated, my head was swimming with
U||   confused apprehension, my eyes must have glared. Preciosa was
U||   frightened, and rising from her seat, stood with an inquiring glance of
U||   surprise in her eyes. But I was bent with frenzy upon my purpose. I was
U||   merely aware that she was in the room. I saw nothing else. I heard
U||   nothing. I cared for nothing, but to see her through that magic glass,
U||   and feel at once, all the fulness of blissful perfection which that
U||   would reveal. Preciosa stood before the mirror, but alarmed at my wild
U||   and eager movements, unable to distinguish what I had in my hands, and
U||   seeing me raise them suddenly to my face, she shrieked with terror, and
U||   fell fainting upon the floor, at the very moment that I placed the
U||   glasses before my eyes, and beheld—myself, reflected in the mirror,
U||   before which she had been standing.
U||   “Dear madam,” cried Titbottom, to my wife, springing up and falling
U||   back again in his chair, pale and trembling, while Prue ran to him and
U||   took his hand, and I poured out a glass of water—“I saw myself.”
U||   There was silence for many minutes. Prue laid her hand gently upon the
U||   head of our guest, whose eyes were closed, and who breathed softly,
U||   like an infant in sleeping. Perhaps, in all the long years of anguish
U||   since that hour, no tender hand had touched his brow, nor wiped away
U||   the damps of a bitter sorrow. Perhaps the tender, maternal fingers of
U||   my wife soothed his weary head with the conviction that he felt the
U||   hand of his mother playing with the long hair of her boy in the soft
U||   West Indian morning. Perhaps it was only the natural relief of
U||   expressing a pent-up sorrow. When he spoke again, it was with the old,
U||   subdued tone, and the air of quaint solemnity.
U||   “These things were matters of long, long ago, and I came to this
U||   country soon after. I brought with me, premature age, a past of
U||   melancholy memories, and the magic spectacles. I had become their
U||   slave. I had nothing more to fear. Having seen myself, I was compelled
U||   to see others, properly to understand my relations to them. The lights
U||   that cheer the future of other men had gone out for me. My eyes were
U||   those of an exile turned backwards upon the receding shore, and not
U||   forwards with hope upon the ocean. I mingled with men, but with little
U||   pleasure. There are but many varieties of a few types. I did not find
U||   those I came to clearer sighted than those I had left behind. I heard
U||   men called shrewd and wise, and report said they were highly
U||   intelligent and successful. But when I looked at them through my
U||   glasses, I found no halo of real manliness. My finest sense detected no
U||   aroma of purity and principle; but I saw only a fungus that had
U||   fattened and spread in a night. They all went to the theater to see
U||   actors upon the stage. I went to see actors in the boxes, so
U||   consummately cunning, that the others did not know they were acting,
U||   and they did not suspect it themselves.
U||   “Perhaps you wonder it did not make me misanthropical. My dear friends,
U||   do not forget that I had seen myself. It made me compassionate, not
U||   cynical. Of course I could not value highly the ordinary standards of
U||   success and excellence. When I went to church and saw a thin, blue,
U||   artificial flower, or a great sleepy cushion expounding the beauty of
U||   holiness to pews full of eagles, half-eagles, and threepences, however
U||   adroitly concealed in broadcloth and boots: or saw an onion in an
U||   Easter bonnet weeping over the sins of Magdalen, I did not feel as they
U||   felt who saw in all this, not only propriety, but piety. Or when at
U||   public meetings an eel stood up on end, and wriggled and squirmed
U||   lithely in every direction, and declared that, for his part, he went in
U||   for rainbows and hot water—how could I help seeing that he was still
U||   black and loved a slimy pool?
U||   “I could not grow misanthropical when I saw in the eyes of so many who
U||   were called old, the gushing fountains of eternal youth, and the light
U||   of an immortal dawn, or when I saw those who were esteemed unsuccessful
U||   and aimless, ruling a fair realm of peace and plenty, either in
U||   themselves, or more perfectly in another—a realm and princely
U||   possession for which they had well renounced a hopeless search and a
U||   belated triumph. I knew one man who had been for years a by-word for
U||   having sought the philosopher’s stone. But I looked at him through the
U||   spectacles and saw a satisfaction in concentrated energies, and a
U||   tenacity arising from devotion to a noble dream, which was not apparent
U||   in the youths who pitied him in the aimless effeminacy of clubs, nor in
U||   the clever gentlemen who cracked their thin jokes upon him over a
U||   gossiping dinner.
U||   “And there was your neighbor over the way, who passes for a woman who
U||   has failed in her career, because she is an old maid. People wag solemn
U||   heads of pity, and say that she made so great a mistake in not marrying
U||   the brilliant and famous man who was for long years her suitor. It is
U||   clear that no orange flower will ever bloom for her. The young people
U||   make tender romances about her as they watch her, and think of her
U||   solitary hours of bitter regret, and wasting longing, never to be
U||   satisfied. When I first came to town I shared this sympathy, and
U||   pleased my imagination with fancying her hard struggle with the
U||   conviction that she had lost all that made life beautiful. I supposed
U||   that if I looked at her through my spectacles, I should see that it was
U||   only her radiant temper which so illuminated her dress, that we did not
U||   see it to be heavy sables. But when, one day, I did raise my glasses
U||   and glanced at her, I did not see the old maid whom we all pitied for a
U||   secret sorrow, but a woman whose nature was a tropic, in which the sun
U||   shone, and birds sang, and flowers bloomed forever. There were no
U||   regrets, no doubts and half wishes, but a calm sweetness, a transparent
U||   peace. I saw her blush when that old lover passed by, or paused to
U||   speak to her, but it was only the sign of delicate feminine
U||   consciousness. She knew his love, and honored it, although she could
U||   not understand it nor return it. I looked closely at her, and I saw
U||   that although all the world had exclaimed at her indifference to such
U||   homage, and had declared it was astonishing she should lose so fine a
U||   match, she would only say simply and quietly—
U||   “‘If Shakespeare loved me and I did not love him, how could I marry
U||   him?’
U||   “Could I be misanthropical when I saw such fidelity, and dignity, and
U||   simplicity?
U||   “You may believe that I was especially curious to look at that old
U||   lover of hers, through my glasses. He was no longer young, you know,
U||   when I came, and his fame and fortune were secure. Certainly I have
U||   heard of few men more beloved, and of none more worthy to be loved. He
U||   had the easy manner of a man of the world, the sensitive grace of a
U||   poet, and the charitable judgment of a wide traveller. He was accounted
U||   the most successful and most unspoiled of men. Handsome, brilliant,
U||   wise, tender, graceful, accomplished, rich, and famous, I looked at
U||   him, without the spectacles, in surprise, and admiration, and wondered
U||   how your neighbor over the way had been so entirely untouched by his
U||   homage. I watched their intercourse in society, I saw her gay smile,
U||   her cordial greeting; I marked his frank address, his lofty courtesy.
U||   Their manner told no tales. The eager world was balked, and I pulled
U||   out my spectacles.
U||   “I had seen her, already, and now I saw him. He lived only in memory,
U||   and his memory was a spacious and stately palace. But he did not
U||   oftenest frequent the banqueting hall, where were endless hospitality
U||   and feasting—nor did he loiter much in reception rooms, where a throng
U||   of new visitors was forever swarming—nor did he feed his vanity by
U||   haunting the apartment in which were stored the trophies of his varied
U||   triumphs—nor dream much in the great gallery hung with pictures of his
U||   travels. But from all these lofty halls of memory he constantly escaped
U||   to a remote and solitary chamber, into which no one had ever
U||   penetrated. But my fatal eyes, behind the glasses, followed and entered
U||   with him, and saw that the chamber was a chapel. It was dim, and
U||   silent, and sweet with perpetual incense that burned upon an altar
U||   before a picture forever veiled. There, whenever I chanced to look, I
U||   saw him kneel and pray; and there, by day and by night, a funeral hymn
U||   was chanted.
U||   “I do not believe you will be surprised that I have been content to
U||   remain deputy bookkeeper. My spectacles regulated my ambition, and I
U||   early learned that there were better gods than Plutus. The glasses have
U||   lost much of their fascination now, and I do not often use them.
U||   Sometimes the desire is irresistible. Whenever I am greatly interested,
U||   I am compelled to take them out and see what it is that I admire.
U||   “And yet—and yet,” said Titbottom, after a pause, “I am not sure that I
U||   thank my grandfather.”
U||   Prue had long since laid away her work, and had heard every word of the
U||   story. I saw that the dear woman had yet one question to ask, and had
U||   been earnestly hoping to hear something that would spare her the
U||   necessity of asking. But Titbottom had resumed his usual tone, after
U||   the momentary excitement, and made no further allusion to himself. We
U||   all sat silently; Titbottom’s eyes fastened musingly upon the carpet:
U||   Prue looking wistfully at him, and I regarding both.
U||   It was past midnight, and our guest arose to go. He shook hands
U||   quietly, made his grave Spanish bow to Prue, and taking his hat, went
U||   towards the front door. Prue and I accompanied him. I saw in her eyes
U||   that she would ask her question. And as Titbottom opened the door, I
U||   heard the low words:
U||   “And Preciosa?”
U||   Titbottom paused. He had just opened the door and the moonlight
U||   streamed over him as he stood, turning back to us.
U||   “I have seen her but once since. It was in church, and she was kneeling
U||   with her eyes closed, so that she did not see me. But I rubbed the
U||   glasses well, and looked at her, and saw a white lily, whose stem was
U||   broken, but which was fresh; and luminous, and fragrant, still.”
U||   “That was a miracle,” interrupted Prue.
U||   “Madam, it was a miracle,” replied Titbottom, “and for that one sight I
U||   am devoutly grateful for my grandfather’s gift. I saw, that although a
U||   flower may have lost its hold upon earthly moisture, it may still bloom
U||   as sweetly, fed by the dews of heaven.”
U||   The door closed, and he was gone. But as Prue put her arm in mine and
U||   we went upstairs together, she whispered in my ear:
U||   “How glad I am that you don’t wear spectacles.”

U||MY DOUBLE; AND HOW HE UNDID ME[49][15]
U||   By Edward Everett Hale (1822–1909)
U||   It is not often that I trouble the readers of The Atlantic Monthly. I
U||   should not trouble them now, but for the importunities of my wife, who
U||   “feels to insist” that a duty to society is unfulfilled, till I have
U||   told why I had to have a double, and how he undid me. She is sure, she
U||   says, that intelligent persons cannot understand that pressure upon
U||   public servants which alone drives any man into the employment of a
U||   double. And while I fear she thinks, at the bottom of her heart, that
U||   my fortunes will never be re-made, she has a faint hope, that, as
U||   another Rasselas, I may teach a lesson to future publics, from which
U||   they may profit, though we die. Owing to the behavior of my double, or,
U||   if you please, to that public pressure which compelled me to employ
U||   him, I have plenty of leisure to write this communication.
U||   I am, or rather was, a minister, of the Sandemanian connection. I was
U||   settled in the active, wide-awake town of Naguadavick, on one of the
U||   finest water-powers in Maine. We used to call it a Western town in the
U||   heart of the civilization of New England. A charming place it was and
U||   is. A spirited, brave young parish had I; and it seemed as if we might
U||   have all “the joy of eventful living” to our hearts’ content.
U||   Alas! how little we knew on the day of my ordination, and in those
U||   halcyon moments of our first housekeeping! To be the confidential
U||   friend in a hundred families in the town—cutting the social trifle, as
U||   my friend Haliburton says, “from the top of the whipped-syllabub to the
U||   bottom of the sponge-cake, which is the foundation”—to keep abreast of
U||   the thought of the age in one’s study, and to do one’s best on Sunday
U||   to interweave that thought with the active life of an active town, and
U||   to inspirit both and make both infinite by glimpses of the Eternal
U||   Glory, seemed such an exquisite forelook into one’s life! Enough to do,
U||   and all so real and so grand! If this vision could only have lasted.
U||   The truth is, that this vision was not in itself a delusion, nor,
U||   indeed, half bright enough. If one could only have been left to do his
U||   own business, the vision would have accomplished itself and brought out
U||   new paraheliacal visions, each as bright as the original. The misery
U||   was and is, as we found out, I and Polly, before long, that, besides
U||   the vision, and besides the usual human and finite failures in life
U||   (such as breaking the old pitcher that came over in the Mayflower, and
U||   putting into the fire the alpenstock with which her father climbed Mont
U||   Blanc)—besides, these, I say (imitating the style of Robinson Crusoe),
U||   there were pitchforked in on us a great rowen-heap of humbugs, handed
U||   down from some unknown seed-time, in which we were expected, and I
U||   chiefly, to fulfil certain public functions before the community, of
U||   the character of those fulfilled by the third row of supernumeraries
U||   who stand behind the Sepoys in the spectacle of the Cataract of the
U||   Ganges. They were the duties, in a word, which one performs as member
U||   of one or another social class or subdivision, wholly distinct from
U||   what one does as A. by himself A. What invisible power put these
U||   functions on me, it would be very hard to tell. But such power there
U||   was and is. And I had not been at work a year before I found I was
U||   living two lives, one real and one merely functional—for two sets of
U||   people, one my parish, whom I loved, and the other a vague public, for
U||   whom I did not care two straws. All this was in a vague notion, which
U||   everybody had and has, that this second life would eventually bring out
U||   some great results, unknown at present, to somebody somewhere.
U||   Crazed by this duality of life, I first read Dr. Wigan on the Duality
U||   of the Brain, hoping that I could train one side of my head to do these
U||   outside jobs, and the other to do my intimate and real duties. For
U||   Richard Greenough once told me that, in studying for the statue of
U||   Franklin, he found that the left side of the great man’s face was
U||   philosophic and reflective, and the right side funny and smiling. If
U||   you will go and look at the bronze statue, you will find he has
U||   repeated this observation there for posterity. The eastern profile is
U||   the portrait of the statesman Franklin, the western of Poor Richard.
U||   But Dr. Wigan does not go into these niceties of this subject, and I
U||   failed. It was then that, on my wife’s suggestion, I resolved to look
U||   out for a Double.
U||   I was, at first, singularly successful. We happened to be recreating at
U||   Stafford Springs that summer. We rode out one day, for one of the
U||   relaxations of that watering-place, to the great Monsonpon House. We
U||   were passing through one of the large halls, when my destiny was
U||   fulfilled! I saw my man!
U||   He was not shaven. He had on no spectacles. He was dressed in a green
U||   baize roundabout and faded blue overalls, worn sadly at the knee. But I
U||   saw at once that he was of my height, five feet four and a half. He had
U||   black hair, worn off by his hat. So have and have not I. He stooped in
U||   walking. So do I. His hands were large, and mine. And—choicest gift of
U||   Fate in all—he had, not “a strawberry-mark on his left arm,” but a cut
U||   from a juvenile brickbat over his right eye, slightly affecting the
U||   play of that eyebrow. Reader, so have I!—My fate was sealed!
U||   A word with Mr. Holley, one of the inspectors, settled the whole thing.
U||   It proved that this Dennis Shea was a harmless, amiable fellow, of the
U||   class known as shiftless, who had sealed his fate by marrying a dumb
U||   wife, who was at that moment ironing in the laundry. Before I left
U||   Stafford, I had hired both for five years. We had applied to Judge
U||   Pynchon, then the probate judge at Springfield, to change the name of
U||   Dennis Shea to Frederic Ingham. We had explained to the Judge, what was
U||   the precise truth, that an eccentric gentleman wished to adopt Dennis
U||   under this new name into his family. It never occurred to him that
U||   Dennis might be more than fourteen years old. And thus, to shorten this
U||   preface, when we returned at night to my parsonage at Naguadavick,
U||   there entered Mrs. Ingham, her new dumb laundress, myself, who am Mr.
U||   Frederic Ingham, and my double, who was Mr. Frederic Ingham by as good
U||   right as I.
U||   Oh, the fun we had the next morning in shaving his beard to my pattern,
U||   cutting his hair to match mine, and teaching him how to wear and how to
U||   take off gold-bowed spectacles! Really, they were electroplate, and the
U||   glass was plain (for the poor fellow’s eyes were excellent). Then in
U||   four successive afternoons I taught him four speeches. I had found
U||   these would be quite enough for the supernumerary-Sepoy line of life,
U||   and it was well for me they were. For though he was good-natured, he
U||   was very shiftless, and it was, as our national proverb says, “like
U||   pulling teeth” to teach him. But at the end of the next week he could
U||   say, with quite my easy and frisky air:
U||   1. “Very well, thank you. And you?” This for an answer to casual
U||   salutations.
U||   2. “I am very glad you liked it.”
U||   3. “There has been so much said, and, on the whole, so well said, that
U||   I will not occupy the time.”
U||   4. “I agree, in general, with my friend on the other side of the room.”
U||   At first I had a feeling that I was going to be at great cost for
U||   clothing him. But it proved, of course, at once, that, whenever he was
U||   out, I should be at home. And I went, during the bright period of his
U||   success, to so few of those awful pageants which require a black
U||   dress-coat and what the ungodly call, after Mr. Dickens, a white
U||   choker, that in the happy retreat of my own dressing-gowns and jackets
U||   my days went by as happily and cheaply as those of another Thalaba. And
U||   Polly declares there was never a year when the tailoring cost so
U||   little. He lived (Dennis, not Thalaba) in his wife’s room over the
U||   kitchen. He had orders never to show himself at that window. When he
U||   appeared in the front of the house, I retired to my sanctissimum and my
U||   dressing-gown. In short, the Dutchman and, his wife, in the old
U||   weather-box, had not less to do with, each other than he and I. He made
U||   the furnace-fire and split the wood before daylight; then he went to
U||   sleep again, and slept late; then came for orders, with a red silk
U||   bandanna tied round his head, with his overalls on, and his dress-coat
U||   and spectacles off. If we happened to be interrupted, no one guessed
U||   that he was Frederic Ingham as well as I; and, in the neighborhood,
U||   there grew up an impression that the minister’s Irishman worked
U||   day-times in the factory village at New Coventry. After I had given him
U||   his orders, I never saw him till the next day.
U||   I launched him by sending him to a meeting of the Enlightenment Board.
U||   The Enlightenment Board consists of seventy-four members, of whom
U||   sixty-seven are necessary to form a quorum. One becomes a member under
U||   the regulations laid down in old Judge Dudley’s will. I became one by
U||   being ordained pastor of a church in Naguadavick. You see you cannot
U||   help yourself, if you would. At this particular time we had had four
U||   successive meetings, averaging four hours each—wholly occupied in
U||   whipping in a quorum. At the first only eleven men were present; at the
U||   next, by force of three circulars, twenty-seven; at the third, thanks
U||   to two days’ canvassing by Auchmuty and myself, begging men to come, we
U||   had sixty. Half the others were in Europe. But without a quorum we
U||   could do nothing. All the rest of us waited grimly for our four hours,
U||   and adjourned without any action. At the fourth meeting we had flagged,
U||   and only got fifty-nine together. But on the first appearance of my
U||   double—whom I sent on this fatal Monday to the fifth meeting—he was the
U||   sixty-seventh man who entered the room. He was greeted with a storm of
U||   applause! The poor fellow had missed his way—read the street signs ill
U||   through his spectacles (very ill, in fact, without them)—and had not
U||   dared to inquire. He entered the room—finding the president and
U||   secretary holding to their chairs two judges of the Supreme Court, who
U||   were also members ex officio, and were begging leave to go away. On his
U||   entrance all was changed. Presto, the by-laws were amended, and the
U||   Western property was given away. Nobody stopped to converse with him.
U||   He voted, as I had charged him to do, in every instance, with the
U||   minority. I won new laurels as a man of sense, though a little
U||   unpunctual—and Dennis, alias Ingham, returned to the parsonage,
U||   astonished to see with how little wisdom the world is governed. He cut
U||   a few of my parishioners in the street; but he had his glasses off, and
U||   I am known to be nearsighted. Eventually he recognized them more
U||   readily than I.
U||   I “set him again” at the exhibition of the New Coventry Academy; and
U||   here he undertook a “speaking part”—as, in my boyish, worldly days, I
U||   remember the bills used to say of Mlle. Celeste. We are all trustees of
U||   the New Coventry Academy; and there has lately been “a good deal of
U||   feeling” because the Sandemanian trustees did not regularly attend the
U||   exhibitions. It has been intimated, indeed, that the Sandemanians are
U||   leaning towards Free-Will, and that we have, therefore, neglected these
U||   semi-annual exhibitions, while there is no doubt that Auchmuty last
U||   year went to Commencement at Waterville. Now the head master at New
U||   Coventry is a real good fellow, who knows a Sanskrit root when he sees
U||   it, and often cracks etymologies with me—so that, in strictness, I
U||   ought to go to their exhibitions. But think, reader, of sitting through
U||   three long July days in that Academy chapel, following the program from
U||   Tuesday Morning. English Composition. Sunshine. Miss Jones,
U||   round to
U||   Trio on Three Pianos. Duel from opera of Midshipman Easy. Marryatt.
U||   coming in at nine, Thursday evening! Think of this, reader, for men who
U||   know the world is trying to go backward, and who would give their lives
U||   if they could help it on! Well! The double had succeeded so well at the
U||   Board, that I sent him to the Academy. (Shade of Plato, pardon!) He
U||   arrived early on Tuesday, when, indeed, few but mothers and clergymen
U||   are generally expected, and returned in the evening to us, covered with
U||   honors. He had dined at the right hand of the chairman, and he spoke in
U||   high terms of the repast. The chairman had expressed his interest in
U||   the French conversation. “I am very glad you liked it,” said Dennis;
U||   and the poor chairman, abashed, supposed the accent had been wrong. At
U||   the end of the day, the gentlemen present had been called upon for
U||   speeches—the Rev. Frederic Ingham first, as it happened; upon which
U||   Dennis had risen, and had said, “There has been so much said, and, on
U||   the whole, so well said, that I will not occupy the time.” The girls
U||   were delighted, because Dr. Dabney, the year before, had given them at
U||   this occasion a scolding on impropriety of behavior at lyceum lectures.
U||   They all declared Mr. Ingham was a love—and so handsome! (Dennis is
U||   good-looking.) Three of them, with arms behind the others’ waists,
U||   followed him up to the wagon he rode home in; and a little girl with a
U||   blue sash had been sent to give him a rosebud. After this debut in
U||   speaking, he went to the exhibition for two days more, to the mutual
U||   satisfaction of all concerned. Indeed, Polly reported that he had
U||   pronounced the trustees’ dinners of a higher grade than those of the
U||   parsonage. When the next term began, I found six of the Academy girls
U||   had obtained permission to come across the river and attend our church.
U||   But this arrangement did not long continue.
U||   After this he went to several Commencements for me, and ate the dinners
U||   provided; he sat through three of our Quarterly Conventions for
U||   me—always voting judiciously, by the simple rule mentioned above, of
U||   siding with the minority. And I, meanwhile, who had before been losing
U||   caste among my friends, as holding myself aloof from the associations
U||   of the body, began to rise in everybody’s favor. “Ingham’s a good
U||   fellow—always on hand”; “never talks much—but does the right thing at
U||   the right time”; “is not as unpunctual as he used to be—he comes early,
U||   and sits through to the end.” “He has got over his old talkative habit,
U||   too. I spoke to a friend of his about it once; and I think Ingham took
U||   it kindly,” etc., etc.
U||   This voting power of Dennis was particularly valuable at the quarterly
U||   meetings of the Proprietors of the Naguadavick Ferry. My wife inherited
U||   from her father some shares in that enterprise, which is not yet fully
U||   developed, though it doubtless will become a very valuable property.
U||   The law of Maine then forbade stockholders to appear by proxy at such
U||   meetings. Polly disliked to go, not being, in fact, a “hens’-rights
U||   hen,” and transferred her stock to me. I, after going once, disliked it
U||   more than she. But Dennis went to the next meeting, and liked it very
U||   much. He said the armchairs were good, the collation good, and the free
U||   rides to stockholders pleasant. He was a little frightened when they
U||   first took him upon one of the ferry-boats, but after two or three
U||   quarterly meetings he became quite brave.
U||   Thus far I never had any difficulty with him. Indeed, being of that
U||   type which is called shiftless, he was only too happy to be told daily
U||   what to do, and to be charged not to be forthputting or in any way
U||   original in his discharge of that duty. He learned, however, to
U||   discriminate between the lines of his life, and very much preferred
U||   these stockholders’ meetings and trustees’ dinners and commencement
U||   collations to another set of occasions, from which he used to beg off
U||   most piteously. Our excellent brother, Dr. Fillmore, had taken a notion
U||   at this time that our Sandemanian churches needed more expression of
U||   mutual sympathy. He insisted upon it that we were remiss. He said,
U||   that, if the Bishop came to preach at Naguadavick, all the Episcopal
U||   clergy of the neighborhood were present; if Dr. Pond came, all the
U||   Congregational clergymen turned out to hear him; if Dr. Nichols, all
U||   the Unitarians; and he thought we owed it to each other that, whenever
U||   there was an occasional service at a Sandemanian church, the other
U||   brethren should all, if possible, attend. “It looked well,” if nothing
U||   more. Now this really meant that I had not been to hear one of Dr.
U||   Fillmore’s lectures on the Ethnology of Religion. He forgot that he did
U||   not hear one of my course on the Sandemanianism of Anselm. But I felt
U||   badly when he said it; and afterwards I always made Dennis go to hear
U||   all the brethren preach, when I was not preaching myself. This was what
U||   he took exceptions to—the only thing, as I said, which he ever did
U||   except to. Now came the advantage of his long morning-nap, and of the
U||   green tea with which Polly supplied the kitchen. But he would plead, so
U||   humbly, to be let off, only from one or two! I never excepted him,
U||   however. I knew the lectures were of value, and I thought it best he
U||   should be able to keep the connection.
U||   Polly is more rash than I am, as the reader has observed in the outset
U||   of this memoir. She risked Dennis one night under the eyes of her own
U||   sex. Governor Gorges had always been very kind to us; and when he gave
U||   his great annual party to the town, asked us. I confess I hated to go.
U||   I was deep in the new volume of Pfeiffer’s Mystics, which Haliburton
U||   had just sent me from Boston. “But how rude,” said Polly, “not to
U||   return the Governor’s civility and Mrs. Gorges’s, when they will be
U||   sure to ask why you are away!” Still I demurred, and at last she, with
U||   the wit of Eve and of Semiramis conjoined, let me off by saying that,
U||   if I would go in with her, and sustain the initial conversations with
U||   the Governor and the ladies staying there, she would risk Dennis for
U||   the rest of the evening. And that was just what we did. She took Dennis
U||   in training all that afternoon, instructed him in fashionable
U||   conversation, cautioned him against the temptations of the
U||   supper-table—and at nine in the evening he drove us all down in the
U||   carryall. I made the grand star-entrée with Polly and the pretty Walton
U||   girls, who were staying with us. We had put Dennis into a great rough
U||   top-coat, without his glasses—and the girls never dreamed, in the
U||   darkness, of looking at him. He sat in the carriage, at the door, while
U||   we entered. I did the agreeable to Mrs. Gorges, was introduced to her
U||   niece. Miss Fernanda—I complimented Judge Jeffries on his decision in
U||   the great case of D’Aulnay vs. Laconia Mining Co.—I stepped into the
U||   dressing-room for a moment—stepped out for another—walked home, after a
U||   nod with Dennis, and tying the horse to a pump—and while I walked home,
U||   Mr. Frederic Ingham, my double, stepped in through the library into the
U||   Gorges’s grand saloon.
U||   Oh! Polly died of laughing as she told me of it at midnight! And even
U||   here, where I have to teach my hands to hew the beech for stakes to
U||   fence our cave, she dies of laughing as she recalls it—and says that
U||   single occasion was worth all we have paid for it. Gallant Eve that she
U||   is! She joined Dennis at the library door, and in an instant presented
U||   him to Dr. Ochterlong, from Baltimore, who was on a visit in town, and
U||   was talking with her, as Dennis came in. “Mr. Ingham would like to hear
U||   what you were telling us about your success among the German
U||   population.” And Dennis bowed and said, in spite of a scowl from Polly,
U||   “I’m very glad you liked it.” But Dr. Ochterlong did not observe, and
U||   plunged into the tide of explanation, Dennis listening like a
U||   prime-minister, and bowing like a mandarin—which is, I suppose, the
U||   same thing. Polly declared it was just like Haliburton’s Latin
U||   conversation with the Hungarian minister, of which he is very fond of
U||   telling. “Quoene sit historia Reformationis in Ungariâ?” quoth
U||   Haliburton, after some thought. And his confrère replied gallantly, “In
U||   seculo decimo tertio,” etc., etc., etc.; and from decimo tertio[50][16]
U||   to the nineteenth century and a half lasted till the oysters came. So
U||   was it that before Dr. Ochterlong came to the “success,” or near it,
U||   Governor Gorges came to Dennis and asked him to hand Mrs. Jeffries down
U||   to supper, a request which he heard with great joy.
U||   Polly was skipping round the room, I guess, gay as a lark. Auchmuty
U||   came to her “in pity for poor Ingham,” who was so bored by the stupid
U||   pundit—and Auchmuty could not understand why I stood it so long. But
U||   when Dennis took Mrs. Jeffries down, Polly could not resist standing
U||   near them. He was a little flustered, till the sight of the eatables
U||   and drinkables gave him the same Mercian courage which it gave Diggory.
U||   A little excited then, he attempted one or two of his speeches to the
U||   Judge’s lady. But little he knew how hard it was to get in even a
U||   promptu there edgewise. “Very well, I thank you,” said he, after the
U||   eating elements were adjusted; “and you?” And then did not he have to
U||   hear about the mumps, and the measles, and arnica, and belladonna, and
U||   chamomile-flower, and dodecathem, till she changed oysters for
U||   salad—and then about the old practice and the new, and what her sister
U||   said, and what her sister’s friend said, and what the physician to her
U||   sister’s friend said, and then what was said by the brother of the
U||   sister of the physician of the friend of her sister, exactly as if it
U||   had been in Ollendorff? There was a moment’s pause, as she declined
U||   champagne. “I am very glad you liked it,” said Dennis again, which he
U||   never should have said, but to one who complimented a sermon. “Oh! you
U||   are so sharp, Mr. Ingham! No! I never drink any wine at all—except
U||   sometimes in summer a little currant spirits—from our own currants, you
U||   know. My own mother—that is, I call her my own mother, because, you
U||   know, I do not remember,” etc., etc., etc.; till they came to the
U||   candied orange at the end of the feast—when Dennis, rather confused,
U||   thought he must say something, and tried No. 4—“I agree, in general,
U||   with my friend the other side of the room”—which he never should have
U||   said but at a public meeting. But Mrs. Jeffries, who never listens
U||   expecting to understand, caught him up instantly with, “Well, I’m sure
U||   my husband returns the compliment; he always agrees with you—though we
U||   do worship with the Methodists—but you know, Mr. Ingham,” etc., etc.,
U||   etc., till the move was made upstairs; and as Dennis led her through
U||   the hall, he was scarcely understood by any but Polly, as he said,
U||   “There has been so much said, and, on the whole, so well said, that I
U||   will not occupy the time.”
U||   His great resource the rest of the evening was standing in the library,
U||   carrying on animated conversations with one and another in much the
U||   same way. Polly had initiated him in the mysteries of a discovery of
U||   mine, that it is not necessary to finish your sentence in a crowd, but
U||   by a sort of mumble, omitting sibilants and dentals. This, indeed, if
U||   your words fail you, answers even in public extempore speech—but better
U||   where other talking is going on. Thus: “We missed you at the Natural
U||   History Society, Ingham.” Ingham replies: “I am very gligloglum, that
U||   is, that you were m-m-m-m-m.” By gradually dropping the voice, the
U||   interlocutor is compelled to supply the answer. “Mrs. Ingham, I hope
U||   your friend Augusta is better.” Augusta has not been ill. Polly cannot
U||   think of explaining, however, and answers: “Thank you, ma’am; she is
U||   very rearason wewahwewob,” in lower and lower tones. And Mrs.
U||   Throckmorton, who forgot the subject of which she spoke, as soon as she
U||   asked the question, is quite satisfied. Dennis could see into the
U||   card-room, and came to Polly to ask if he might not go and play
U||   all-fours. But, of course, she sternly refused. At midnight they came
U||   home delightedly: Polly, as I said, wild to tell me the story of
U||   victory; only both the pretty Walton girls said: “Cousin Frederic, you
U||   did not come near me all the evening.”
U||   We always called him Dennis at home, for convenience, though his real
U||   name was Frederic Ingham, as I have explained. When the election day
U||   came round, however, I found that by some accident there was only one
U||   Frederic Ingham’s name on the voting-list; and, as I was quite busy
U||   that day in writing some foreign letters to Halle, I thought I would
U||   forego my privilege of suffrage, and stay quietly at home, telling
U||   Dennis that he might use the record on the voting-list and vote. I gave
U||   him a ticket, which I told him he might use, if he liked to. That was
U||   that very sharp election in Maine which the readers of The Atlantic so
U||   well remember, and it had been intimated in public that the ministers
U||   would do well not to appear at the polls. Of course, after that, we had
U||   to appear by self or proxy. Still, Naguadavick was not then a city, and
U||   this standing in a double queue at townmeeting several hours to vote
U||   was a bore of the first water; and so, when I found that there was but
U||   one Frederic Ingham on the list, and that one of us must give up, I
U||   stayed at home and finished the letters (which, indeed, procured for
U||   Fothergill his coveted appointment of Professor of Astronomy at
U||   Leavenworth), and I gave Dennis, as we called him, the chance.
U||   Something in the matter gave a good deal of popularity to the Frederic
U||   Ingham name; and at the adjourned election, next week, Frederic Ingham
U||   was chosen to the legislature. Whether this was I or Dennis, I never
U||   really knew. My friends seemed to think it was I; but I felt, that, as
U||   Dennis had done the popular thing, he was entitled to the honor; so I
U||   sent him to Augusta when the time came, and he took the oaths. And a
U||   very valuable member he made. They appointed him on the Committee on
U||   Parishes; but I wrote a letter for him, resigning, on the ground that
U||   he took an interest in our claim to the stumpage in the minister’s
U||   sixteenths of Gore A, next No. 7, in the 10th Range. He never made any
U||   speeches, and always voted with the minority, which was what he was
U||   sent to do. He made me and himself a great many good friends, some of
U||   whom I did not afterwards recognize as quickly as Dennis did my
U||   parishioners. On one or two occasions, when there was wood to saw at
U||   home, I kept him at home; but I took those occasions to go to Augusta
U||   myself. Finding myself often in his vacant seat at these times, I
U||   watched the proceedings with a good deal of care; and once was so much
U||   excited that I delivered my somewhat celebrated speech on the Central
U||   School District question, a speech of which the State of Maine printed
U||   some extra copies. I believe there is no formal rule permitting
U||   strangers to speak; but no one objected.
U||   Dennis himself, as I said, never spoke at all. But our experience this
U||   session led me to think, that if, by some such “general understanding”
U||   as the reports speak of in legislation daily, every member of Congress
U||   might leave a double to sit through those deadly sessions and answer to
U||   roll-calls and do the legitimate party-voting, which appears
U||   stereotyped in the regular list of Ashe, Bocock, Black, etc., we should
U||   gain decidedly in working power. As things stand, the saddest state
U||   prison I ever visit is that Representatives’ Chamber in Washington. If
U||   a man leaves for an hour, twenty “correspondents” may be howling,
U||   “Where was Mr. Prendergast when the Oregon bill passed?” And if poor
U||   Prendergast stays there! Certainly, the worst use you can make of a man
U||   is to put him in prison!
U||   I know, indeed, that public men of the highest rank have resorted to
U||   this expedient long ago. Dumas’s novel of The Iron Mask turns on the
U||   brutal imprisonment of Louis the Fourteenth’s double. There seems
U||   little doubt, in our own history, that it was the real General Pierce
U||   who shed tears when the delegate from Lawrence explained to him the
U||   sufferings of the people there—and only General Pierce’s double who had
U||   given the orders for the assault on that town, which was invaded the
U||   next day. My charming friend, George Withers, has, I am almost sure, a
U||   double, who preaches his afternoon sermons for him. This is the reason
U||   that the theology often varies so from that of the forenoon. But that
U||   double is almost as charming as the original. Some of the most
U||   well-defined men, who stand out most prominently on the background of
U||   history, are in this way stereoscopic men; who owe their distinct
U||   relief to the slight differences between the doubles. All this I know.
U||   My present suggestion is simply the great extension of the system, so
U||   that all public machine-work may be done by it.
U||   But I see I loiter on my story, which is rushing to the plunge. Let me
U||   stop an instant more, however, to recall, were it only to myself, that
U||   charming year while all was yet well. After the double had become a
U||   matter of course, for nearly twelve months before he undid me, what a
U||   year it was! Full of active life, full of happy love, of the hardest
U||   work, of the sweetest sleep, and the fulfilment of so many of the fresh
U||   aspirations and dreams of boyhood! Dennis went to every
U||   school-committee meeting, and sat through all those late wranglings
U||   which used to keep me up till midnight and awake till morning. He
U||   attended all the lectures to which foreign exiles sent me tickets
U||   begging me to come for the love of Heaven and of Bohemia. He accepted
U||   and used all the tickets for charity concerts which were sent to me. He
U||   appeared everywhere where it was specially desirable that “our
U||   denomination,” or “our party,” or “our class,” or “our family,” or “our
U||   street,” or “our town,” or “our country,” or “our state,” should be
U||   fully represented. And I fell back to that charming life which in
U||   boyhood one dreams of, when he supposes he shall do his own duty and
U||   make his own sacrifices, without being tied up with those of other
U||   people. My rusty Sanskrit, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French,
U||   Italian, Spanish, German and English began to take polish. Heavens! how
U||   little I had done with them while I attended to my public duties! My
U||   calls on my parishioners became the friendly, frequent, homelike
U||   sociabilities they were meant to be, instead of the hard work of a man
U||   goaded to desperation by the sight of his lists of arrears. And
U||   preaching! what a luxury preaching was when I had on Sunday the whole
U||   result of an individual, personal week, from which to speak to a people
U||   whom all that week I had been meeting as hand-to-hand friend! I never
U||   tired on Sunday, and was in condition to leave the sermon at home, if I
U||   chose, and preach it extempore, as all men should do always. Indeed, I
U||   wonder, when I think that a sensible people like ours—really more
U||   attached to their clergy than they were in the lost days, when the
U||   Mathers and Nortons were noblemen—should choose to neutralize so much
U||   of their ministers’ lives, and destroy so much of their early training,
U||   by this undefined passion for seeing them in public. It springs from
U||   our balancing of sects. If a spirited Episcopalian takes an interest in
U||   the almshouse, and is put on the Poor Board, every other denomination
U||   must have a minister there, lest the poorhouse be changed into St.
U||   Paul’s Cathedral. If a Sandemanian is chosen president of the Young
U||   Men’s Library, there must be a Methodist vice-president and a Baptist
U||   secretary. And if a Universalist Sunday-School Convention collects five
U||   hundred delegates, the next Congregationalist Sabbath-School Conference
U||   must be as large, “lest ‘they’—whoever they may be—should think
U||   ‘we’—whoever we may be—are going down.”
U||   Freed from these necessities, that happy year, I began to know my wife
U||   by sight. We saw each other sometimes. In those long mornings, when
U||   Dennis was in the study explaining to map-peddlers that I had eleven
U||   maps of Jerusalem already, and to school-book agents that I would see
U||   them hanged before I would be bribed to introduce their textbooks into
U||   the schools—she and I were at work together, as in those old dreamy
U||   days—and in these of our log-cabin again. But all this could not
U||   last—and at length poor Dennis, my double, overtasked in turn, undid
U||   me.
U||   It was thus it happened. There is an excellent fellow—once a minister—I
U||   will call him Isaacs—who deserves well of the world till he dies, and
U||   after—because he once, in a real exigency, did the right thing, in the
U||   right way, at the right time, as no other man could do it. In the
U||   world’s great football match, the ball by chance found him loitering on
U||   the outside of the field; he closed with it, “camped” it, charged, it
U||   home—yes, right through the other side—not disturbed, not frightened by
U||   his own success—and breathless found himself a great man—as the Great
U||   Delta rang applause. But he did not find himself a rich man; and the
U||   football has never come in his way again. From that moment to this
U||   moment he has been of no use, that one can see, at all. Still, for that
U||   great act we speak of Isaacs gratefully and remember him kindly; and he
U||   forges on, hoping to meet the football somewhere again. In that vague
U||   hope, he had arranged a “movement” for a general organization of the
U||   human family into Debating Clubs, County Societies, State Unions, etc.,
U||   etc., with a view of inducing all children to take hold of the handles
U||   of their knives and forks, instead of the metal. Children have bad
U||   habits in that way. The movement, of course, was absurd; but we all did
U||   our best to forward, not it, but him. It came time for the annual
U||   county-meeting on this subject to be held at Naguadavick. Isaacs came
U||   round, good fellow! to arrange for it—got the townhall, got the
U||   Governor to preside (the saint!—he ought to have triplet doubles
U||   provided him by law), and then came to get me to speak. “No,” I said,
U||   “I would not speak, if ten Governors presided. I do not believe in the
U||   enterprise. If I spoke, it should be to say children should take hold
U||   of the prongs of the forks and the blades of the knives. I would
U||   subscribe ten dollars, but I would not speak a mill.” So poor Isaacs
U||   went his way, sadly, to coax Auchmuty to speak, and Delafield. I went
U||   out. Not long after, he came back, and told Polly that they had
U||   promised to speak—the Governor would speak—and he himself would close
U||   with the quarterly report, and some interesting anecdotes regarding.
U||   Miss Biffin’s way of handling her knife and Mr. Nellis’s way of footing
U||   his fork. “Now if Mr. Ingham will only come and sit on the platform, he
U||   need not say one word; but it will show well in the paper—it will show
U||   that the Sandemanians take as much interest in the movement as the
U||   Armenians or the Mesopotamians, and will be a great favor to me.”
U||   Polly, good soul! was tempted, and she promised. She knew Mrs. Isaacs
U||   was starving, and the babies—she knew Dennis was at home—and she
U||   promised! Night came, and I returned. I heard her story. I was sorry. I
U||   doubted. But Polly had promised to beg me, and I dared all! I told
U||   Dennis to hold his peace, under all circumstances, and sent him down.
U||   It was not half an hour more before he returned, wild with
U||   excitement—in a perfect Irish fury—which it was long before I
U||   understood. But I knew at once that he had undone me!
U||   What happened was this: The audience got together, attracted by
U||   Governor Gorges’s name. There were a thousand people. Poor Gorges was
U||   late from Augusta. They became impatient. He came in direct from the
U||   train at last, really ignorant of the object of the meeting. He opened
U||   it in the fewest possible words, and said other gentlemen were present
U||   who would entertain them better than he. The audience were
U||   disappointed, but waited. The Governor, prompted by Isaacs, said, “The
U||   Honorable Mr. Delafield will address you.” Delafield had forgotten the
U||   knives and forks, and was playing the Ruy Lopez opening at the chess
U||   club. “The Rev. Mr. Auchmuty will address you.” Auchmuty had promised
U||   to speak late, and was at the school committee. “I see Dr. Stearns in
U||   the hall; perhaps he will say a word.” Dr. Stearns said he had come to
U||   listen and not to speak. The Governor and Isaacs whispered. The
U||   Governor looked at Dennis, who was resplendent on the platform; but
U||   Isaacs, to give him his due, shook his head. But the look was enough. A
U||   miserable lad, ill-bred, who had once been in Boston, thought it would
U||   sound well to call for me, and peeped out, “Ingham!” A few more
U||   wretches cried, “Ingham! Ingham!” Still Isaacs was firm; but the
U||   Governor, anxious, indeed, to prevent a row, knew I would say
U||   something, and said, “Our friend Mr. Ingham is always prepared—and
U||   though we had not relied upon him, he will say a word, perhaps.”
U||   Applause followed, which turned Dennis’s head. He rose, flattered, and
U||   tried No. 3: “There has been so much said, and, on the whole, so well
U||   said, that I will not longer occupy the time!” and sat down, looking
U||   for his hat; for things seemed squally. But the people cried, “Go on!
U||   go on!” and some applauded. Dennis, still confused, but flattered by
U||   the applause, to which neither he nor I are used, rose again, and this
U||   time tried No. 2: “I am very glad you liked it!” in a sonorous, clear
U||   delivery. My best friends stared. All the people who did not know me
U||   personally yelled with delight at the aspect of the evening; the
U||   Governor was beside himself, and poor Isaacs thought he was undone!
U||   Alas, it was I! A boy in the gallery cried in a loud tone, “It’s all an
U||   infernal humbug,” just as Dennis, waving his hand, commanded silence,
U||   and tried No. 4: “I agree, in general, with my friend the other side of
U||   the room.” The poor Governor doubted his senses, and crossed to stop
U||   him—not in time, however. The same gallery-boy shouted, “How’s your
U||   mother?”—and Dennis, now completely lost, tried, as his last shot, No.
U||   1, vainly: “Very well, thank you; and you?”
U||   I think I must have been undone already. But Dennis, like another
U||   Lockhard chose “to make sicker.” The audience rose in a whirl of
U||   amazement, rage, and sorrow. Some other impertinence, aimed at Dennis,
U||   broke all restraint, and, in pure Irish, he delivered himself of an
U||   address to the gallery, inviting any person who wished to fight to come
U||   down and do so—stating, that they were all dogs and cowards—that he
U||   would take any five of them single-handed, “Shure, I have said all his
U||   Riverence and the Misthress bade me say,” cried he, in defiance; and,
U||   seizing the Governor’s cane from his hand, brandished it, quarter-staff
U||   fashion, above his head. He was, indeed, got from the hall only with
U||   the greatest difficulty by the Governor, the City Marshal, who had been
U||   called in, and the Superintendent of my Sunday School.
U||   The universal impression, of course, was, that the Rev. Frederic Ingham
U||   had lost all command of himself in some of those haunts of intoxication
U||   which for fifteen years I have been laboring to destroy. Till this
U||   moment, indeed, that is the impression in Naguadavick. This number of
U||   The Atlantic will relieve from it a hundred friends of mine who have
U||   been sadly wounded by that notion now for years—but I shall not be
U||   likely ever to show my head there again.
U||   No! My double has undone me.
U||   We left town at seven the next morning. I came to No. 9, in the Third
U||   Range, and settled on the Minister’s Lot, In the new towns in Maine,
U||   the first settled minister has a gift of a hundred acres of land. I am
U||   the first settled minister in No. 9. My wife and little Paulina are my
U||   parish. We raise corn enough to live on in summer. We kill bear’s meat
U||   enough to carbonize it in winter. I work on steadily on my Traces of
U||   Sandemanianism in the Sixth and Seventh Centuries, which I hope to
U||   persuade Phillips, Sampson & Co. to publish next year. We are very
U||   happy, but the world thinks we are undone.

U||A VISIT TO THE ASYLUM FOR AGED AND DECAYED PUNSTERS[53][17]
U||   By Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809–1894)
U||   Having just returned from a visit to this admirable Institution in
U||   company with a friend who is one of the Directors, we propose giving a
U||   short account of what we saw and heard. The great success of the Asylum
U||   for Idiots and Feeble-minded Youth, several of the scholars from which
U||   have reached considerable distinction, one of them being connected with
U||   a leading Daily Paper in this city, and others having served in the
U||   State and National Legislatures, was the motive which led to the
U||   foundation of this excellent charity. Our late distinguished townsman,
U||   Noah Dow, Esquire, as is well known, bequeathed a large portion of his
U||   fortune to this establishment— “being thereto moved,” as his will
U||   expressed it, “by the desire of N. Dowing some public Institution for
U||   the benefit of Mankind.” Being consulted as to the Rules of the
U||   Institution and the selection of a Superintendent, he replied, that
U||   “all Boards must construct their own Platforms of operation. Let them
U||   select anyhow and he should be pleased.” N.E. Howe, Esq., was chosen in
U||   compliance with this delicate suggestion.
U||   The Charter provides for the support of “One hundred aged and decayed
U||   Gentlemen-Punsters.” On inquiry if there way no provision for females,
U||   my friend called my attention to this remarkable psychological fact,
U||   namely:
U||   There is no such thing as a female Punster.
U||   This remark struck me forcibly, and on reflection I found that I never
U||   knew nor heard of one, though I have once or twice heard a woman make a
U||   single detached pun, as I have known a hen to crow.
U||   On arriving at the south gate of the Asylum grounds, I was about to
U||   ring, but my friend held my arm and begged me to rap with my stick,
U||   which I did. An old man with a very comical face presently opened the
U||   gate and put out his head.
U||   “So you prefer Cane to A bell, do you?” he said—and began chuckling and
U||   coughing at a great rate.
U||   My friend winked at me.
U||   “You’re here still, Old Joe, I see,” he said to the old man.
U||   “Yes, yes—and it’s very odd, considering how often I’ve bolted,
U||   nights.”
U||   He then threw open the double gates for us to ride through.
U||   “Now,” said the old man, as he pulled the gates after us, “you’ve had a
U||   long journey.”
U||   “Why, how is that, Old Joe?” said my friend.
U||   “Don’t you see?” he answered; “there’s the East hinges on the one side
U||   of the gate, and there’s the West hinges on t’other side—haw! haw!
U||   haw!”
U||   We had no sooner got into the yard than a feeble little gentleman, with
U||   a remarkably bright eye, came up to us, looking very serious, as if
U||   something had happened.
U||   “The town has entered a complaint against the Asylum as a gambling
U||   establishment,” he said to my friend, the Director.
U||   “What do you mean?” said my friend.
U||   “Why, they complain that there’s a lot o’ rye on the premises,” he
U||   answered, pointing to a field of that grain—and hobbled away, his
U||   shoulders shaking with laughter, as he went.
U||   On entering the main building, we saw the Rules and Regulations for the
U||   Asylum conspicuously posted up. I made a few extracts which may be
U||   interesting:
U||   Sect. I. Of Verbal Exercises.
U||   5. Each Inmate shall be permitted to make Puns freely from eight in the
U||   morning until ten at night, except during Service in the Chapel and
U||   Grace before Meals.
U||   6. At ten o’clock the gas will be turned off, and no further Puns,
U||   Conundrums, or other play on words will be allowed to be uttered, or to
U||   be uttered aloud.
U||   9. Inmates who have lost their faculties and cannot any longer make
U||   Puns shall be permitted to repeat such as may be selected for them by
U||   the Chaplain out of the work of Mr. Joseph Miller.
U||   10. Violent and unmanageable Punsters, who interrupt others when
U||   engaged in conversation, with Puns or attempts at the same, shall be
U||   deprived of their Joseph Millers, and, if necessary, placed in solitary
U||   confinement.
U||   Sect. III. Of Deportment at Meals.
U||   4. No Inmate shall make any Pun, or attempt at the same, until the
U||   Blessing has been asked and the company are decently seated.
U||   7. Certain Puns having been placed on the Index Expurgatorius of the
U||   Institution, no Inmate shall be allowed to utter them, on pain of being
U||   debarred the perusal of Punch and Vanity Fair, and, if repeated,
U||   deprived of his Joseph Miller.
U||   Among these are the following:
U||   Allusions to Attic salt, when asked to pass the salt-cellar.
U||   Remarks on the Inmates being mustered, etc., etc.
U||   Associating baked beans with the bene-factors of the Institution.
U||   Saying that beef-eating is befitting, etc., etc.
U||   The following are also prohibited, excepting to such Inmates as may
U||   have lost their faculties and cannot any longer make Puns of their own:
U||   “——your own hair or a wig”; “it will be long enough,” etc., etc.;
U||   “little of its age,” etc., etc.; also, playing upon the following
U||   words: hospital; mayor; pun; pitied; bread; sauce, etc., etc., etc. See
U||   INDEX EXPURGATORIUS, printed for use of Inmates.
U||   The subjoined Conundrum is not allowed: Why is Hasty Pudding like the
U||   Prince? Because it comes attended by its sweet; nor this variation to
U||   it, to wit: Because the ’lasses runs after it.
U||   The Superintendent, who went round with us, had been a noted punster in
U||   his time, and well known in the business world, but lost his customers
U||   by making too free with their names—as in the famous story he set
U||   afloat in ’29 of four Jerries attaching to the names of a noted Judge,
U||   an eminent Lawyer, the Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions, and
U||   the well-known Landlord at Springfield. One of the four Jerries, he
U||   added, was of gigantic magnitude. The play on words was brought out by
U||   an accidental remark of Solomons, the well-known Banker. “Capital
U||   punishment!” the Jew was overheard saying, with reference to the guilty
U||   parties. He was understood, as saying, A capital pun is meant, which
U||   led to an investigation and the relief of the greatly excited public
U||   mind.
U||   The Superintendent showed some of his old tendencies, as he went round
U||   with us.
U||   “Do you know”—he broke out all at once—“why they don’t take steppes in
U||   Tartary for establishing Insane Hospitals?”
U||   We both confessed ignorance.
U||   “Because there are nomad people to be found there,” he said, with a
U||   dignified smile.
U||   He proceeded to introduce us to different Inmates. The first was a
U||   middle-aged, scholarly man, who was seated at a table with a Webster’s
U||   Dictionary and a sheet of paper before him.
U||   “Well, what luck to-day, Mr. Mowzer?” said the Superintendent.
U||   “Three or four only,” said Mr. Mowzer. “Will you hear ’em now—now I’m
U||   here?”
U||   We all nodded.
U||   “Don’t you see Webster ers in the words center and theater?
U||   “If he spells leather lether, and feather fether, isn’t there danger
U||   that he’ll give us a bad spell of weather?
U||   “Besides, Webster is a resurrectionist; he does not allow u to rest
U||   quietly in the mould.
U||   “And again, because Mr. Worcester inserts an illustration in his text,
U||   is that any reason why Mr. Webster’s publishers should hitch one on in
U||   their appendix? It’s what I call a Connect-a-cut trick.
U||   “Why is his way of spelling like the floor of an oven? Because it is
U||   under bread.”
U||   “Mowzer!” said the Superintendent, “that word is on the Index!”
U||   “I forgot,” said Mr. Mowzer; “please don’t deprive me of Vanity Fair
U||   this one time, sir.”
U||   “These are all, this morning. Good day, gentlemen.” Then to the
U||   Superintendent: “Add you, sir!”
U||   The next Inmate was a semi-idiotic-looking old man. He had a heap of
U||   block-letters before him, and, as we came up, he pointed, without
U||   saying a word, to the arrangements he had made with them on the table.
U||   They were evidently anagrams, and had the merit of transposing the
U||   letters of the words employed without addition or subtraction. Here are
U||   a few of them:
U||   Times.      Smite!
U||   Post.         Stop!
U||   Tribune.       True nib.
U||   World.         Dr. Owl.
U||   Advertiser. { Res veri dat.
U||                      { Is true. Read!
U||   Allopathy.   All o’ th’ Pay.
U||   Homœopathy.   O, the ——! O! O, my! Pah!
U||   The mention of several New York papers led to two or three questions.
U||   Thus: Whether the Editor of The Tribune was H.G. really? If the
U||   complexion of his politics were not accounted for by his being an eager
U||   person himself? Whether Wendell Fillips were not a reduced copy of John
U||   Knocks? Whether a New York Feuilletoniste is not the same thing as a
U||   Fellow down East?
U||   At this time a plausible-looking, bald-headed man joined us, evidently
U||   waiting to take a part in the conversation.
U||   “Good morning, Mr. Riggles,” said the Superintendent, “Anything fresh
U||   this morning? Any Conundrum?”
U||   “I haven’t looked at the cattle,” he answered, dryly.
U||   “Cattle? Why cattle?”
U||   “Why, to see if there’s any corn under ’em!” he said; and immediately
U||   asked, “Why is Douglas like the earth?”
U||   We tried, but couldn’t guess.
U||   “Because he was flattened out at the polls!” said Mr. Riggles.
U||   “A famous politician, formerly,” said the Superintendent. “His
U||   grandfather was a seize-Hessian-ist in the Revolutionary War. By the
U||   way, I hear the freeze-oil doctrines don’t go down at New Bedford.”
U||   The next Inmate looked as if he might have been a sailor formerly.
U||   “Ask him what his calling was,” said the Superintendent.
U||   “Followed the sea,” he replied to the question put by one of us. “Went
U||   as mate in a fishing-schooner.”
U||   “Why did you give it up?”
U||   “Because I didn’t like working for two mast-ers,” he replied.
U||   Presently we came upon a group of elderly persons, gathered about a
U||   venerable gentleman with flowing locks, who was propounding questions
U||   to a row of Inmates.
U||   “Can any Inmate give me a motto for M. Berger?” he said.
U||   Nobody responded for two or three minutes. At last one old man, whom I
U||   at once recognized as a Graduate of our University (Anno 1800) held up
U||   his hand.
U||   “Rem a cue tetigit.”
U||   “Go to the head of the class, Josselyn,” said the venerable patriarch.
U||   The successful Inmate did as he was told, but in a very rough way,
U||   pushing against two or three of the Class.
U||   “How is this?” said the Patriarch.
U||   “You told me to go up jostlin’,” he replied.
U||   The old gentlemen who had been shoved about enjoyed the pun too much to
U||   be angry.
U||   Presently the Patriarch asked again:
U||   “Why was M. Berger authorized to go to the dances given to the Prince?”
U||   The Class had to give up this, and he answered it himself:
U||   “Because every one of his carroms was a tick-it to the ball.”
U||   “Who collects the money to defray the expenses of the last campaign in
U||   Italy?” asked the Patriarch.
U||   Here again the Class failed.
U||   “The war-cloud’s rolling Dun,” he answered.
U||   “And what is mulled wine made with?”
U||   Three or four voices exclaimed at once:
U||   “Sizzle-y Madeira!”
U||   Here a servant entered, and said, “Luncheon-time.” The old gentlemen,
U||   who have excellent appetites, dispersed at once, one of them politely
U||   asking us if we would not stop and have a bit of bread and a little
U||   mite of cheese.
U||   “There is one thing I have forgotten to show you,” said the
U||   Superintendent, “the cell for the confinement of violent and
U||   unmanageable Punsters.”
U||   We were very curious to see it, particularly with reference to the
U||   alleged absence of every object upon which a play of words could
U||   possibly be made.
U||   The Superintendent led us up some dark stairs to a corridor, then along
U||   a narrow passage, then down a broad flight of steps into another
U||   passageway, and opened a large door which looked out on the main
U||   entrance.
U||   “We have not seen the cell for the confinement of ‘violent and
U||   unmanageable’ Punsters,” we both exclaimed.
U||   “This is the sell!” he exclaimed, pointing to the outside prospect.
U||   My friend, the Director, looked me in the face so good-naturedly that I
U||   had to laugh.
U||   “We like to humor the Inmates,” he said. “It has a bad effect, we find,
U||   on their health and spirits to disappoint them of their little
U||   pleasantries. Some of the jests to which we have listened are not new
U||   to me, though I dare say you may not have heard them often before. The
U||   same thing happens in general society, with this additional
U||   disadvantage, that there is no punishment provided for ‘violent and
U||   unmanageable’ Punsters, as in our Institution.”
U||   We made our bow to the Superintendent and walked to the place where our
U||   carriage was waiting for us. On our way, an exceedingly decrepit old
U||   man moved slowly toward us, with a perfectly blank look on his face,
U||   but still appearing as if he wished to speak.
U||   “Look!” said the Director—“that is our Centenarian.”
U||   The ancient man crawled toward us, cocked one eye, with which he seemed
U||   to see a little, up at us, and said:
U||   “Sarvant, young Gentlemen. Why is a—a—a—like a—a—a—? Give it up?
U||   Because it’s a—a—a—a—.”
U||   He smiled a pleasant smile, as if it were all plain enough.
U||   “One hundred and seven last Christmas,” said the Director. “Of late
U||   years he puts his whole Conundrums in blank—but they please him just as
U||   well.”
U||   We took our departure, much gratified and instructed by our visit,
U||   hoping to have some future opportunity of inspecting the Records of
U||   this excellent Charity and making extracts for the benefit of our
U||   Readers.

U||THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY[55][18]
U||   By Mark Twain (1835–1910)
U||   In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from
U||   the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
U||   inquired after my friend’s friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to
U||   do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that
U||   Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth; and that my friend never knew such a
U||   personage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler
U||   about him, it would remind him of his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would
U||   go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence of
U||   him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was
U||   the design, it succeeded.
U||   I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the
U||   dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel’s, and I noticed
U||   that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning
U||   gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up,
U||   and gave me good-day. I told him a friend had commissioned me to make
U||   some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named
U||   Leonidas W. Smiley—Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young minister of the
U||   Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of Angel’s Camp. I
U||   added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev.
U||   Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him.
U||   Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his
U||   chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which
U||   follows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never
U||   changed his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned his
U||   initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of
U||   enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein
U||   of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that,
U||   so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny
U||   about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and
U||   admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse. I let
U||   him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.
U||   “Rev. Leonidas W. H’m, Reverend Le—well, there was a feller here once
U||   by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of ’49—or may be it was the
U||   spring of ’50—I don’t recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me
U||   think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume
U||   warn’t finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the
U||   curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever
U||   see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he
U||   couldn’t he’d change sides. Any way that suited the other man would
U||   suit him—any way just so’s he got a bet, he was satisfied. But still he
U||   was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was
U||   always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn’t be no solit’ry
U||   thing mentioned but that feller’d offer to bet on it, and take any side
U||   you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you’d
U||   find him flush or you’d find him busted at the end of it; if there was
U||   a dog-fight, he’d bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he’d bet on it;
U||   if there was a chicken-fight, he’d bet on it; why, if there was two
U||   birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first;
U||   or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg’lar to bet on
U||   Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and
U||   he was, too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go
U||   anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to—to
U||   wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that
U||   straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound
U||   for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen
U||   that Smiley and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no
U||   difference to him—he’d bet on any thing—the dangest feller. Parson
U||   Walker’s wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as
U||   if they warn’t going to save her; but one morning he come in, and
U||   Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable
U||   better—thank the Lord for his inf’nit’ mercy—and coming on so smart
U||   that with the blessing of Prov’dence she’d get well yet; and Smiley,
U||   before he thought, says, Well, I’ll risk two-and-a-half she don’t
U||   anyway.’”
U||   Thish-yer Smiley had a mare—the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag,
U||   but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was faster
U||   than that—and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so
U||   slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption,
U||   or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred
U||   yards start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of
U||   the race she’d get excited and desperate-like, and come cavorting and
U||   straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the
U||   air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking up
U||   m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing
U||   and blowing her nose—and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck
U||   ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.
U||   And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you’d think he
U||   warn’t worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a
U||   chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a
U||   different dog; his under-jaw’d begin to stick out like the fo’-castle
U||   of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the
U||   furnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him,
U||   and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew
U||   Jackson—which was the name of the pup—Andrew Jackson would never let on
U||   but what he was satisfied, and hadn’t expected nothing else—and the
U||   bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the
U||   money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog
U||   jest by the j’int of his hind leg and freeze to it—not chaw, you
U||   understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the
U||   sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup,
U||   till he harnessed a dog once that didn’t have no hind legs, because
U||   they’d been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone
U||   along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to make a
U||   snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he’d been imposed on,
U||   and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he ’peared
U||   surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn’t try
U||   no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He gave Smiley
U||   a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was his fault,
U||   for putting up a dog that hadn’t no hind legs for him to take holt of,
U||   which was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a
U||   piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew
U||   Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he’d lived, for the
U||   stuff was in him and he had genius—I know it, because he hadn’t no
U||   opportunities to speak of, and it don’t stand to reason that a dog
U||   could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances if he
U||   hadn’t no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I think of that
U||   last fight of his’n, and the way it turned out.
U||   Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and
U||   tom-cats and all of them kind of things, till you couldn’t rest, and
U||   you couldn’t fetch nothing for him to bet on but he’d match you. He
U||   ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal’lated to
U||   educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in
U||   his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn
U||   him, too. He’d give him a little punch behind, and the next minute
U||   you’d see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut—see him turn
U||   one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start, and come
U||   down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the
U||   matter of ketching flies, and kep’ him in practice so constant, that
U||   he’d nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all
U||   a frog wanted was education, and he could do ’most anything—and I
U||   believe him. Why, I’ve seen him set Dan’l Webster down here on this
U||   floor—Dan’l Webster was the name of the frog—and sing out, “Flies,
U||   Dan’l, flies!” and quicker’n you could wink he’d spring straight up and
U||   snake a fly off’n the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag’in
U||   as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head
U||   with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn’t no idea he’d been
U||   doin’ any more’n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and
U||   straightfor’ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come
U||   to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more
U||   ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see.
U||   Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when
U||   it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a
U||   red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for
U||   fellers that had traveled and been everywheres, all said he laid over
U||   any frog that ever they see.
U||   Well, Smiley kep’ the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to
U||   fetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller—a
U||   stranger in the camp, he was—come acrost him with his box, and says:
U||   “What might be that you’ve got in the box?”
U||   And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, “It might be a parrot, or it
U||   might be a canary, maybe, but it ain’t—it’s only just a frog.”
U||   And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round
U||   this way and that, and says, “H’m—so ’tis. Well, what’s he good for?”
U||   “Well,” Smiley says, easy and careless, “he’s good enough for one
U||   thing, I should judge—he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county.”
U||   The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look,
U||   and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, “Well,” he says,
U||   “I don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n any other
U||   frog.”
U||   “Maybe you don’t,” Smiley says. “Maybe you understand frogs and maybe
U||   you don’t understand ’em; maybe you’ve had experience, and maybe you
U||   ain’t only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I’ve got my opinion and I’ll
U||   risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.”
U||   And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like, “Well,
U||   I’m only a stranger here, and I ain’t got no frog; but if I had a frog,
U||   I’d bet you.”
U||   And then Smiley says, “That’s all right—that’s all right—if you’ll hold
U||   my box a minute, I’ll go and get you a frog.” And so the feller took
U||   the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley’s, and set down
U||   to wait.
U||   So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and then
U||   he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and
U||   filled him full of quail shot—filled! him pretty near up to his
U||   chin—and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped
U||   around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and
U||   fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:
U||   “Now, if you’re ready, set him alongside of Dan’l, with his forepaws
U||   just even with Dan’l’s, and I’ll give the word.” Then he says,
U||   “One—two—three—git!” and him and the feller touched up the frogs from
U||   behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan’l give a heave, and
U||   hysted up his shoulders—so—like a Frenchman, but it warn’t no use—he
U||   couldn’t budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn’t no
U||   more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal
U||   surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn’t have no idea what
U||   the matter was, of course.
U||   The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out
U||   at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder—so—at Dan’l,
U||   and says again, very deliberate, “Well,” he says, “I don’t see no
U||   p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n any other frog.”
U||   Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan’l a long
U||   time, and at last says, “I do wonder what in the nation that frog
U||   throwed off for—I wonder if there ain’t something the matter with
U||   him—he ’pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.” And he ketched Dan’l up
U||   by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, “Why blame my cats if
U||   he don’t weigh five pounds!” and turned him upside down and he belched
U||   out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was
U||   the maddest man—he set the frog down and took out after that feller,
U||   but he never ketched him. And——
U||   (Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got
U||   up to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, he
U||   said: “Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy—I ain’t going to
U||   be gone a second.”
U||   But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history
U||   of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me
U||   much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I
U||   started away.
U||   At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me
U||   and recommenced:
U||   “Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn’t have no
U||   tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and——”
U||   However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear
U||   about the afflicted cow, but took my leave.

U||ELDER BROWN’S BACKSLIDE[57][19]
U||   By Harry Stillwell Edwards (1855- )
U||  I
U||   Elder Brown told his wife good-by at the farmhouse door as mechanically
U||   as though his proposed trip to Macon, ten miles away, was an everyday
U||   affair, while, as a matter of fact, many years had elapsed since
U||   unaccompanied he set foot in the city. He did not kiss her. Many very
U||   good men never kiss their wives. But small blame attaches to the elder
U||   for his omission on this occasion, since his wife had long ago
U||   discouraged all amorous demonstrations on the part of her liege lord,
U||   and at this particular moment was filling the parting moments with a
U||   rattling list of directions concerning thread, buttons, hooks, needles,
U||   and all the many etceteras of an industrious housewife’s basket. The
U||   elder was laboriously assorting these postscript commissions in his
U||   memory, well knowing that to return with any one of them neglected
U||   would cause trouble in the family circle.
U||   Elder Brown mounted his patient steed that stood sleepily motionless in
U||   the warm sunlight, with his great pointed ears displayed to the right
U||   and left, as though their owner had grown tired of the life burden
U||   their weight inflicted upon him, and was, old soldier fashion, ready to
U||   forego the once rigid alertness of early training for the pleasures of
U||   frequent rest on arms.
U||   “And, elder, don’t you forgit them caliker scraps, or you’ll be wantin’
U||   kiver soon an’ no kiver will be a-comin’.”
U||   Elder Brown did not turn his head, but merely let the whip hand, which
U||   had been checked in its backward motion, fall as he answered
U||   mechanically. The beast he bestrode responded with a rapid whisking of
U||   its tail and a great show of effort, as it ambled off down the sandy
U||   road, the rider’s long legs seeming now and then to touch the ground.
U||   But as the zigzag panels of the rail fence crept behind him, and he
U||   felt the freedom of the morning beginning to act upon his well-trained
U||   blood, the mechanical manner of the old man’s mind gave place to a mild
U||   exuberance. A weight seemed to be lifting from it ounce by ounce as the
U||   fence panels, the weedy corners, the persimmon sprouts and sassafras
U||   bushes crept away behind him, so that by the time a mile lay between
U||   him and the life partner of his joys and sorrows he was in a reasonably
U||   contented frame of mind, and still improving.
U||   It was a queer figure that crept along the road that cheery May
U||   morning. It was tall and gaunt, and had been for thirty years or more.
U||   The long head, bald on top, covered behind with iron-gray hair, and in
U||   front with a short tangled growth that curled and kinked in every
U||   direction, was surmounted by an old-fashioned stove-pipe hat, worn and
U||   stained, but eminently impressive. An old-fashioned Henry Clay cloth
U||   coat, stained and threadbare, divided itself impartially over the
U||   donkey’s back and dangled on his sides. This was all that remained of
U||   the elder’s wedding suit of forty years ago. Only constant care, and
U||   use of late years limited to extra occasions, had preserved it so long.
U||   The trousers had soon parted company with their friends. The
U||   substitutes were red jeans, which, while they did not well match his
U||   court costume, were better able to withstand the old man’s abuse, for
U||   if, in addition to his frequent religious excursions astride his beast,
U||   there ever was a man who was fond of sitting down with his feet higher
U||   than his head, it was this selfsame Elder Brown.
U||   The morning expanded, and the old man expanded with it; for while a
U||   vigorous leader in his church, the elder at home was, it must be
U||   admitted, an uncomplaining slave. To the intense astonishment of the
U||   beast he rode, there came new vigor into the whacks which fell upon his
U||   flanks; and the beast allowed astonishment to surprise him into real
U||   life and decided motion. Somewhere in the elder’s expanding soul a tune
U||   had begun to ring. Possibly he took up the far, faint tune that came
U||   from the straggling gang of negroes away off in the field, as they
U||   slowly chopped amid the threadlike rows of cotton plants which lined
U||   the level ground, for the melody he hummed softly and then sang
U||   strongly, in the quavering, catchy tones of a good old country
U||   churchman, was “I’m glad salvation’s free.”
U||   It was during the singing of this hymn that Elder Brown’s regular
U||   motion-inspiring strokes were for the first time varied. He began to
U||   hold his hickory up at certain pauses in the melody, and beat the
U||   changes upon the sides of his astonished steed. The chorus under this
U||   arrangement was:
U||   I’m glad salvation’s free,
U||   I’m glad salvation’s free,
U||   I’m glad salvation’s free for all,
U||   I’m glad salvation’s free.
U||   Wherever there is an italic, the hickory descended. It fell about as
U||   regularly and after the fashion of the stick beating upon the bass drum
U||   during a funeral march. But the beast, although convinced that
U||   something serious was impending, did not consider a funeral march
U||   appropriate for the occasion. He protested, at first, with vigorous
U||   whiskings of his tail and a rapid shifting of his ears. Finding these
U||   demonstrations unavailing, and convinced that some urgent cause for
U||   hurry had suddenly invaded the elder’s serenity, as it had his own, he
U||   began to cover the ground with frantic leaps that would have surprised
U||   his owner could he have realized what was going on. But Elder Brown’s
U||   eyes were half closed, and he was singing at the top of his voice. Lost
U||   in a trance of divine exaltation, for he felt the effects of the
U||   invigorating motion, bent only on making the air ring with the lines
U||   which he dimly imagined were drawing upon him the eyes of the whole
U||   female congregation, he was supremely unconscious that his beast was
U||   hurrying.
U||   And thus the excursion proceeded, until suddenly a shote, surprised in
U||   his calm search for roots in a fence corner, darted into the road, and
U||   stood for an instant gazing upon the newcomers with that idiotic stare
U||   which only a pig can imitate. The sudden appearance of this
U||   unlooked-for apparition acted strongly upon the donkey. With one
U||   supreme effort he collected himself into a motionless mass of matter,
U||   bracing his front legs wide apart; that is to say, he stopped short.
U||   There he stood, returning the pig’s idiotic stare with an interest
U||   which must have led to the presumption that never before in all his
U||   varied life had he seen such a singular little creature. End over end
U||   went the man of prayer, finally bringing up full length in the sand,
U||   striking just as he should have shouted “free” for the fourth time in
U||   his glorious chorus.
U||   Fully convinced that his alarm had been well founded, the shote sped
U||   out from under the gigantic missile hurled at him by the donkey, and
U||   scampered down the road, turning first one ear and then the other to
U||   detect any sounds of pursuit. The donkey, also convinced that the
U||   object before which he had halted was supernatural, started back
U||   violently upon seeing it apparently turn to a man. But seeing that it
U||   had turned to nothing but a man, he wandered up into the deserted fence
U||   corner, and began to nibble refreshment from a scrub oak.
U||   For a moment the elder gazed up into the sky, half impressed with the
U||   idea that the camp-meeting platform had given way. But the truth forced
U||   its way to the front in his disordered understanding at last, and with
U||   painful dignity he staggered into an upright position, and regained his
U||   beaver. He was shocked again. Never before in all the long years it had
U||   served him had he seen it in such shape. The truth is, Elder Brown had
U||   never before tried to stand on his head in it. As calmly as possible he
U||   began to straighten it out, caring but little for the dust upon his
U||   garments. The beaver was his special crown of dignity. To lose it was
U||   to be reduced to a level with the common woolhat herd. He did his best,
U||   pulling, pressing, and pushing, but the hat did not look natural when
U||   he had finished. It seemed to have been laid off into counties,
U||   sections, and town lots. Like a well-cut jewel, it had a face for him,
U||   view it from whatever point he chose, a quality which so impressed him
U||   that a lump gathered in his throat, and his eyes winked vigorously.
U||   Elder Brown was not, however, a man for tears. He was a man of action.
U||   The sudden vision which met his wandering gaze, the donkey calmly
U||   chewing scrub buds, with the green juice already oozing from the
U||   corners of his frothy mouth, acted upon him like magic. He was, after
U||   all, only human, and when he got hands upon a piece of brush he
U||   thrashed the poor beast until it seemed as though even its already
U||   half-tanned hide would be eternally ruined. Thoroughly exhausted at
U||   last, he wearily straddled his saddle, and with his chin upon his
U||   breast resumed the early morning tenor of his way.
U||  II
U||   “Good-mornin’, sir.”
U||   Elder Brown leaned over the little pine picket which divided the
U||   bookkeepers’ department of a Macon warehouse from the room in general,
U||   and surveyed the well-dressed back of a gentleman who was busily
U||   figuring at a desk within. The apartment was carpetless, and the dust
U||   of a decade lay deep on the old books, shelves, and the familiar
U||   advertisements of guano and fertilizers which decorated the room. An
U||   old stove, rusty with the nicotine contributed by farmers during the
U||   previous season while waiting by its glowing sides for their cotton to
U||   be sold, stood straight up in a bed of sand, and festoons of cobwebs
U||   clung to the upper sashes of the murky windows. The lower sash of one
U||   window had been raised, and in the yard without, nearly an acre in
U||   extent, lay a few bales of cotton, with jagged holes in their ends,
U||   just as the sampler had left them. Elder Brown had time to notice all
U||   these familiar points, for the figure at the desk kept serenely at its
U||   task, and deigned no reply.
U||   “Good-mornin’, sir,” said Elder Brown again, in his most dignified
U||   tones. “Is Mr. Thomas in?”
U||   “Good-morning, sir,” said the figure. “I’ll wait on you in a minute.”
U||   The minute passed, and four more joined it. Then the desk man turned.
U||   “Well, sir, what can I do for you?”
U||   The elder was not in the best of humor when he arrived, and his state
U||   of mind had not improved. He waited full a minute as he surveyed the
U||   man of business.
U||   “I thought I mout be able to make some arrangements with you to git
U||   some money, but I reckon I was mistaken.” The warehouse man came
U||   nearer.
U||   “This is Mr. Brown, I believe. I did not recognize you at once. You are
U||   not in often to see us.”
U||   “No; my wife usually ’tends to the town bizness, while I run the church
U||   and farm. Got a fall from my donkey this morning,” he said, noticing a
U||   quizzical, interrogating look upon the face before him, “and fell
U||   squar’ on the hat.” He made a pretense of smoothing it. The man of
U||   business had already lost interest.
U||   “How much money will you want, Mr. Brown?”
U||   “Well, about seven hundred dollars,” said the elder, replacing his hat,
U||   and turning a furtive look upon the warehouse man. The other was
U||   tapping with his pencil upon the little shelf lying across the rail.
U||   “I can get you five hundred.”
U||   “But I oughter have seven.”
U||   “Can’t arrange for that amount. Wait till later in the season, and come
U||   again. Money is very tight now. How much cotton will you raise?”
U||   “Well, I count on a hundr’d bales. An’ you can’t git the sev’n hundr’d
U||   dollars?”
U||   “Like to oblige you, but can’t right now; will fix it for you later
U||   on.”
U||   “Well,” said the elder, slowly, “fix up the papers for five, an’ I’ll
U||   make it go as far as possible.”
U||   The papers were drawn. A note was made out for $552.50, for the
U||   interest was at one and a half per cent. for seven months, and a
U||   mortgage on ten mules belonging to the elder was drawn and signed. The
U||   elder then promised to send his cotton to the warehouse to be sold in
U||   the fall, and with a curt “Anything else?” and a “Thankee, that’s all,”
U||   the two parted.
U||   Elder Brown now made an effort to recall the supplemental commissions
U||   shouted to him upon his departure, intending to execute them first, and
U||   then take his written list item by item. His mental resolves had just
U||   reached this point when a new thought made itself known. Passersby were
U||   puzzled to see the old man suddenly snatch his headpiece off and peer
U||   with an intent and awestruck air into its irregular caverns. Some of
U||   them were shocked when he suddenly and vigorously ejaculated:
U||   “Hannah-Maria-Jemimy! goldarn an’ blue blazes!”
U||   He had suddenly remembered having placed his memoranda in that hat, and
U||   as he studied its empty depths his mind pictured the important scrap
U||   fluttering along the sandy scene of his early-morning tumble. It was
U||   this that caused him to graze an oath with less margin that he had
U||   allowed himself in twenty years. What would the old lady say?
U||   Alas! Elder Brown knew too well. What she would not say was what
U||   puzzled him. But as he stood bareheaded in the sunlight a sense of
U||   utter desolation came and dwelt with him. His eye rested upon sleeping
U||   Balaam anchored to a post in the street, and so as he recalled the
U||   treachery that lay at the base of all his affliction, gloom was added
U||   to the desolation.
U||   To turn back and search for the lost paper would have been worse than
U||   useless. Only one course was open to him, and at it went the leader of
U||   his people. He called at the grocery; he invaded the recesses of the
U||   dry-goods establishments; he ransacked the hardware stores; and
U||   wherever he went he made life a burden for the clerks, overhauling
U||   show-cases and pulling down whole shelves of stock. Occasionally an
U||   item of his memoranda would come to light, and thrusting his hand into
U||   his capacious pocket, where lay the proceeds of his check, he would pay
U||   for it upon the spot, and insist upon having it rolled up. To the
U||   suggestion of the slave whom he had in charge for the time being that
U||   the articles be laid aside until he had finished, he would not listen.
U||   “Now you look here, sonny,” he said, in the dry-goods store, “I’m
U||   conducting this revival, an’ I don’t need no help in my line. Just you
U||   tie them stockin’s up an’ lemme have ’em. Then I know I’ve got ’em.” As
U||   each purchase was promptly paid for, and change had to be secured, the
U||   clerk earned his salary for that day at least.
U||   So it was when, near the heat of the day, the good man arrived at the
U||   drugstore, the last and only unvisited division of trade, he made his
U||   appearance equipped with half a hundred packages, which nestled in his
U||   arms and bulged out about the sections of his clothing that boasted of
U||   pockets. As he deposited his deck-load upon the counter, great drops of
U||   perspiration rolled down his face and over his waterlogged collar to
U||   the floor.
U||   There was something exquisitely refreshing in the great glasses of
U||   foaming soda that a spruce young man was drawing from a marble
U||   fountain, above which half a dozen polar bears in an ambitious print
U||   were disporting themselves. There came a break in the run of customers,
U||   and the spruce young man, having swept the foam from the marble,
U||   dexterously lifted a glass from the revolving rack which had rinsed it
U||   with a fierce little stream of water, and asked mechanically, as he
U||   caught the intense look of the perspiring elder, “What syrup, sir?”
U||   Now it had not occurred to the elder to drink soda, but the suggestion,
U||   coming as it did in his exhausted state, was overpowering. He drew near
U||   awkwardly, put on his glasses, and examined the list of syrups with
U||   great care. The young man, being for the moment at leisure, surveyed
U||   critically the gaunt figure, the faded bandanna, the antique clawhammer
U||   coat, and the battered stove-pipe hat, with a gradually relaxing
U||   countenance. He even called the prescription clerk’s attention by a
U||   cough and a quick jerk of the thumb. The prescription clerk smiled
U||   freely, and continued his assaults upon a piece of blue mass.
U||   “I reckon,” said the elder, resting his hands upon his knees and
U||   bending down to the list, “you may gimme sassprilla an’ a little
U||   strawberry. Sassprilla’s good for the blood this time er year, an’
U||   strawberry’s good any time.”
U||   The spruce young man let the syrup stream into the glass as he smiled
U||   affably. Thinking, perhaps, to draw out the odd character, he ventured
U||   upon a jest himself, repeating a pun invented by the man who made the
U||   first soda fountain. With a sweep of his arm he cleared away the swarm
U||   of insects as he remarked, “People who like a fly in theirs are easily
U||   accommodated.”
U||   It was from sheer good-nature only that Elder Brown replied, with his
U||   usual broad, social smile, “Well, a fly now an’ then don’t hurt
U||   nobody.”
U||   Now if there is anybody in the world who prides himself on knowing a
U||   thing or two, it is the spruce young man who presides over a soda
U||   fountain. This particular young gentleman did not even deem a reply
U||   necessary. He vanished an instant, and when he returned a close
U||   observer might have seen that the mixture in the glass he bore had
U||   slightly changed color and increased in quantity. But the elder saw
U||   only the whizzing stream of water dart into its center, and the rosy
U||   foam rise and tremble on the glass’s rim. The next instant he was
U||   holding his breath and sipping the cooling drink.
U||   As Elder Brown paid his small score he was at peace with the world. I
U||   firmly believe that when he had finished his trading, and the little
U||   blue-stringed packages had been stored away, could the poor donkey have
U||   made his appearance at the door, and gazed with his meek, fawnlike eyes
U||   into his master’s, he would have obtained full and free forgiveness.
U||   Elder Brown paused at the door as he was about to leave. A rosy-cheeked
U||   schoolgirl was just lifting a creamy mixture to her lips before the
U||   fountain. It was a pretty picture, and he turned back, resolved to
U||   indulge in one more glass of the delightful beverage before beginning
U||   his long ride homeward.
U||   “Fix it up again, sonny,” he said, renewing his broad, confiding smile,
U||   as the spruce young man poised a glass inquiringly. The living
U||   automaton went through the same motions as before, and again Elder
U||   Brown quaffed the fatal mixture.
U||   What a singular power is habit! Up to this time Elder Brown had been
U||   entirely innocent of transgression, but with the old alcoholic fire in
U||   his veins, twenty years dropped from his shoulders, and a feeling came
U||   over him familiar to every man who has been “in his cups.” As a matter
U||   of fact, the elder would have been a confirmed drunkard twenty years
U||   before had his wife been less strong-minded. She took the reins into
U||   her own hands when she found that his business and strong drink did not
U||   mix well, worked him into the church, sustained his resolutions by
U||   making it difficult and dangerous for him to get to his toddy. She
U||   became the business head of the family, and he the spiritual. Only at
U||   rare intervals did he ever “backslide” during the twenty years of the
U||   new era, and Mrs. Brown herself used to say that the “sugar in his’n
U||   turned to gall before the backslide ended.” People who knew her never
U||   doubted it.
U||   But Elder Brown’s sin during the remainder of the day contained an
U||   element of responsibility. As he moved majestically down toward where
U||   Balaam slept in the sunlight, he felt no fatigue. There was a glow upon
U||   his cheek-bones, and a faint tinge upon his prominent nose. He nodded
U||   familiarly to people as he met them, and saw not the look of amusement
U||   which succeeded astonishment upon the various faces. When he reached
U||   the neighborhood of Balaam it suddenly occurred to him that he might
U||   have forgotten some one of his numerous commissions, and he paused to
U||   think. Then a brilliant idea rose in his mind. He would forestall blame
U||   and disarm anger with kindness—he would purchase Hannah a bonnet.
U||   What woman’s heart ever failed to soften at sight of a new bonnet?
U||   As I have stated, the elder was a man of action. He entered a store
U||   near at hand.
U||   “Good-morning,” said an affable gentleman with a Hebrew countenance,
U||   approaching.
U||   “Good-mornin’, good-mornin’,” said the elder, piling his bundles on the
U||   counter. “I hope you are well?” Elder Brown extended his hand fervidly.
U||   “Quite well, I thank you. What—”
U||   “And the little wife?” said Elder Brown, affectionately retaining the
U||   Jew’s hand.
U||   “Quite well, sir.”
U||   “And the little ones—quite well, I hope, too?”
U||   “Yes, sir; all well, thank you. Something I can do for you?”
U||   The affable merchant was trying to recall his customer’s name.
U||   “Not now, not now, thankee. If you please to let my bundles stay untell
U||   I come back—”
U||   “Can’t I show you something? Hat, coat—”
U||   “Not now. Be back bimeby.”
U||   Was it chance or fate that brought Elder Brown in front of a bar? The
U||   glasses shone bright upon the shelves as the swinging door flapped back
U||   to let out a coatless clerk, who passed him with a rush, chewing upon a
U||   farewell mouthful of brown bread and bologna. Elder Brown beheld for an
U||   instant the familiar scene within. The screws of his resolution had
U||   been loosened. At sight of the glistening bar the whole moral structure
U||   of twenty years came tumbling down. Mechanically he entered the saloon,
U||   and laid a silver quarter upon the bar as he said:
U||   “A little whiskey an’ sugar.” The arms of the bartender worked like a
U||   faker’s in a side show as he set out the glass with its little quota of
U||   “short sweetening” and a cut-glass decanter, and sent a half-tumbler of
U||   water spinning along from the upper end of the bar with a dime in
U||   change.
U||   “Whiskey is higher’n used to be,” said Elder Brown; but the bartender
U||   was taking another order, and did not hear him. Elder Brown stirred
U||   away the sugar, and let a steady stream of red liquid flow into the
U||   glass. He swallowed the drink as unconcernedly as though his morning
U||   tod had never been suspended, and pocketed the change. “But it ain’t
U||   any better than it was,” he concluded, as he passed out. He did not
U||   even seem to realize that he had done anything extraordinary.
U||   There was a millinery store up the street, and thither with uncertain
U||   step he wended his way, feeling a little more elate, and altogether
U||   sociable. A pretty, black-eyed girl, struggling to keep down her mirth,
U||   came forward and faced him behind the counter. Elder Brown lifted his
U||   faded hat with the politeness, if not the grace, of a Castilian, and
U||   made a sweeping bow. Again he was in his element. But he did not speak.
U||   A shower of odds and ends, small packages, thread, needles, and
U||   buttons, released from their prison, rattled down about him.
U||   The girl laughed. She could not help it. And the elder, leaning his
U||   hand on the counter, laughed, too, until several other girls came
U||   half-way to the front. Then they, hiding behind counters and suspended
U||   cloaks, laughed and snickered until they reconvulsed the elder’s
U||   vis-à-vis, who had been making desperate efforts to resume her demure
U||   appearance.
U||   “Let me help you, sir,” she said, coming from behind the counter, upon
U||   seeing Elder Brown beginning to adjust his spectacles for a search. He
U||   waved her back majestically. “No, my dear, no; can’t allow it. You mout
U||   sile them purty fingers. No, ma’am. No gen’l’man’ll ’low er lady to do
U||   such a thing.” The elder was gently forcing the girl back to her place.
U||   “Leave it to me. I’ve picked up bigger things ’n them. Picked myself up
U||   this mornin’. Balaam—you don’t know Balaam; he’s my donkey—he tumbled
U||   me over his head in the sand this mornin’.” And Elder Brown had to
U||   resume an upright position until his paroxysm of laughter had passed.
U||   “You see this old hat?” extending it, half full of packages; “I fell
U||   clear inter it; jes’ as clean inter it as them things thar fell out’n
U||   it.” He laughed again, and so did the girls. “But, my dear, I whaled
U||   half the hide off’n him for it.”
U||   “Oh, sir! how could you? Indeed, sir. I think you did wrong. The poor
U||   brute did not know what he was doing, I dare say, and probably he has
U||   been a faithful friend.” The girl cast her mischievous eyes towards her
U||   companions, who snickered again. The old man was not conscious of the
U||   sarcasm. He only saw reproach. His face straightened, and he regarded
U||   the girl soberly.
U||   “Mebbe you’re right, my dear; mebbe I oughtn’t.”
U||   “I am sure of it,” said the girl. “But now don’t you want to buy a
U||   bonnet or a cloak to carry home to your wife?”
U||   “Well, you’re whistlin’ now, birdie; that’s my intention; set ’em all
U||   out.” Again the elder’s face shone with delight. “An’ I don’t want no
U||   one-hoss bonnet neither.”
U||   “Of course not. Now here is one; pink silk, with delicate pale blue
U||   feathers. Just the thing for the season. We have nothing more elegant
U||   in stock.” Elder Brown held it out, upside down, at arm’s-length.
U||   “Well, now, that’s suthin’ like. Will it soot a sorter redheaded
U||   ’ooman?”
U||   A perfectly sober man would have said the girl’s corsets must have
U||   undergone a terrible strain, but the elder did not notice her dumb
U||   convulsion. She answered, heroically:
U||   “Perfectly, sir. It is an exquisite match.”
U||   “I think you’re whistlin’ again. Nancy’s head’s red, red as a
U||   woodpeck’s. Sorrel’s only half-way to the color of her top-knot, an’ it
U||   do seem like red oughter to soot red. Nancy’s red an’ the hat’s red;
U||   like goes with like, an’ birds of a feather flock together.” The old
U||   man laughed until his cheeks were wet.
U||   The girl, beginning to feel a little uneasy, and seeing a customer
U||   entering, rapidly fixed up the bonnet, took fifteen dollars out of a
U||   twenty-dollar bill, and calmly asked the elder if he wanted anything
U||   else. He thrust his change somewhere into his clothes, and beat a
U||   retreat. It had occurred to him that he was nearly drunk.
U||   Elder Brown’s step began to lose its buoyancy. He found himself utterly
U||   unable to walk straight. There was an uncertain straddle in his gait
U||   that carried him from one side of the walk to the other, and caused
U||   people whom he met to cheerfully yield him plenty of room.
U||   Balaam saw him coming. Poor Balaam. He had made an early start that
U||   day, and for hours he stood in the sun awaiting relief. When he opened
U||   his sleepy eyes and raised his expressive ears to a position of
U||   attention, the old familiar coat and battered hat of the elder were
U||   before him. He lifted up his honest voice and cried aloud for joy.
U||   The effect was electrical for one instant. Elder Brown surveyed the
U||   beast with horror, but again in his understanding there rang out the
U||   trumpet words.
U||   “Drunk, drunk, drunk, drer-unc, -er-unc, -unc, -unc.”
U||   He stooped instinctively for a missile with which to smite his accuser,
U||   but brought up suddenly with a jerk and a handful of sand.
U||   Straightening himself up with a majestic dignity, he extended his right
U||   hand impressively.
U||   “You’re a goldarn liar, Balaam, and, blast your old buttons, you kin
U||   walk home by yourself, for I’m danged if you sh’ll ride me er step.”
U||   Surely Coriolanus never turned his back upon Rome with a grander
U||   dignity than sat upon the old man’s form as he faced about and left the
U||   brute to survey with anxious eyes the new departure of his master.
U||   He saw the elder zigzag along the street, and beheld him about to turn
U||   a friendly corner. Once more he lifted up his mighty voice:
U||   “Drunk, drunk, drunk, drer-unc, drer-unc, -erunc, -unc, -unc.”
U||   Once more the elder turned with lifted hand and shouted back:
U||   “You’re a liar, Balaam, goldarn you! You’re er iffamous liar.” Then he
U||   passed from view.
U||  III
U||   Mrs. Brown stood upon the steps anxiously awaiting the return of her
U||   liege lord. She knew he had with him a large sum of money, or should
U||   have, and she knew also that he was a man without business methods. She
U||   had long since repented of the decision which sent him to town. When
U||   the old battered hat and flour-covered coat loomed up in the gloaming
U||   and confronted her, she stared with terror. The next instant she had
U||   seized him.
U||   “For the Lord sakes, Elder Brown, what ails you? As I live, if the man
U||   ain’t drunk! Elder Brown! Elder Brown! for the life of me can’t I make
U||   you hear? You crazy old hypocrite! you desavin’ old sinner! you
U||   black-hearted wretch! where have you ben?”
U||   The elder made an effort to wave her off.
U||   “Woman,” he said, with grand dignity, “you forgit yus-sef; shu know
U||   ware I’ve ben ’swell’s I do. Ben to town, wife, an’ see yer wat I’ve
U||   brought—the fines’ hat, ole woman, I could git. Look’t the color. Like
U||   goes ’ith like; it’s red an’ you’re red, an’ it’s a dead match. What
U||   yer mean? Hey! hole on! ole woman!—you! Hannah!—you.” She literally
U||   shook him into silence.
U||   “You miserable wretch! you low-down drunken sot! what do you mean by
U||   coming home and insulting your wife?” Hannah ceased shaking him from
U||   pure exhaustion.
U||   “Where is it, I say? where is it?”
U||   By this time she was turning his pockets wrong side out. From one she
U||   got pills, from another change, from another packages.
U||   “The Lord be praised, and this is better luck than I hoped! Oh, elder!
U||   elder! elder! what did you do it for? Why, man, where is Balaam?”
U||   Thought of the beast choked off the threatened hysterics.
U||   “Balaam? Balaam?” said the elder, groggily. “He’s in town. The infernal
U||   ole fool ’sulted me, an’ I lef’ him to walk home.”
U||   His wife surveyed him. Really at that moment she did think his mind was
U||   gone; but the leer upon the old man’s face enraged her beyond
U||   endurance.
U||   “You did, did you? Well, now, I reckon you’ll laugh for some cause, you
U||   will. Back you go, sir—straight back; an’ don’t you come home ’thout
U||   that donkey, or you’ll rue it, sure as my name is Hannah Brown.
U||   Aleck!—you Aleck-k-k!”
U||   A black boy darted round the corner, from behind which, with several
U||   others, he had beheld the brief but stirring scene.
U||   “Put a saddle on er mule. The elder’s gwine back to town. And don’t you
U||   be long about it neither.”
U||   “Yessum.” Aleck’s ivories gleamed in the darkness as he disappeared.
U||   Elder Brown was soberer at that moment than he had been for hours.
U||   “Hannah, you don’t mean it?”
U||   “Yes, sir, I do. Back you go to town as sure as my name is Hannah
U||   Brown.”
U||   The elder was silent. He had never known his wife to relent on any
U||   occasion after she had affirmed her intention, supplemented with “as
U||   sure as my name is Hannah Brown.” It was her way of swearing. No
U||   affidavit would have had half the claim upon her as that simple
U||   enunciation.
U||   So back to town went Elder Brown, not in the order of the early morn,
U||   but silently, moodily, despairingly, surrounded by mental and actual
U||   gloom.
U||   The old man had turned a last appealing glance upon the angry woman, as
U||   he mounted with Aleck’s assistance, and sat in the light that streamed
U||   from out the kitchen window. She met the glance without a waver.
U||   “She means it, as sure as my name is Elder Brown,” he said, thickly.
U||   Then he rode on.
U||  IV
U||   To say that Elder Brown suffered on this long journey back to Macon
U||   would only mildly outline his experience. His early morning’s fall had
U||   begun to make itself felt. He was sore and uncomfortable. Besides, his
U||   stomach was empty, and called for two meals it had missed for the first
U||   time in years.
U||   When, sore and weary, the elder entered the city, the electric lights
U||   shone above it like jewels in a crown. The city slept; that is, the
U||   better portion of it did. Here and there, however, the lower lights
U||   flashed out into the night. Moodily the elder pursued his journey, and
U||   as he rode, far off in the night there rose and quivered a plaintive
U||   cry. Elder Brown smiled wearily: it was Balaam’s appeal, and he
U||   recognized it. The animal he rode also recognized it, and replied,
U||   until the silence of the city was destroyed. The odd clamor and
U||   confusion drew from a saloon near by a group of noisy youngsters, who
U||   had been making a night of it. They surrounded Elder Brown as he began
U||   to transfer himself to the hungry beast to whose motion he was more
U||   accustomed, and in the “hail fellow well met” style of the day began to
U||   bandy jests upon his appearance. Now Elder Brown was not in a jesting
U||   humor. Positively he was in the worst humor possible. The result was
U||   that before many minutes passed the old man was swinging several of the
U||   crowd by their collars, and breaking the peace of the city. A policeman
U||   approached, and but for the good-humored party, upon whom the elder’s
U||   pluck had made a favorable impression, would have run the old man into
U||   the barracks. The crowd, however, drew him laughingly into the saloon
U||   and to the bar. The reaction was too much for his half-rallied senses.
U||   He yielded again. The reviving liquor passed his lips. Gloom vanished.
U||   He became one of the boys.
U||   The company into which Elder Brown had fallen was what is known as
U||   “first-class.” To such nothing is so captivating as an adventure out of
U||   the common run of accidents. The gaunt countryman, with his battered
U||   hat and clawhammer coat, was a prize of an extraordinary nature. They
U||   drew him into a rear room, whose gilded frames and polished tables
U||   betrayed the character and purpose of the place, and plied him with
U||   wine until ten thousand lights danced about him. The fun increased. One
U||   youngster made a political speech from the top of the table; another
U||   impersonated Hamlet; and finally Elder Brown was lifted into a chair,
U||   and sang a camp-meeting song. This was rendered by him with startling
U||   effect. He stood upright, with his hat jauntily knocked to one side,
U||   and his coat tails ornamented with a couple of show-bills, kindly
U||   pinned on by his admirers. In his left hand he waved the stub of a
U||   cigar, and on his back was an admirable representation of Balaam’s
U||   head, executed by some artist with billiard chalk.
U||   As the elder sang his favorite hymn, “I’m glad salvation’s free,” his
U||   stentorian voice awoke the echoes. Most of the company rolled upon the
U||   floor in convulsions of laughter.
U||   The exhibition came to a close by the chair overturning. Again Elder
U||   Brown fell into his beloved hat. He arose and shouted: “Whoa, Balaam!”
U||   Again he seized the nearest weapon, and sought satisfaction. The young
U||   gentleman with political sentiments was knocked under the table, and
U||   Hamlet only escaped injury by beating the infuriated elder into the
U||   street.
U||   What next? Well, I hardly know. How the elder found Balaam is a mystery
U||   yet: not that Balaam was hard to find, but that the old man was in no
U||   condition to find anything. Still he did, and climbing laboriously into
U||   the saddle, he held on stupidly while the hungry beast struck out for
U||   home.
U||  V
U||   Hannah Brown did not sleep that night. Sleep would not come. Hour after
U||   hour passed, and her wrath refused to be quelled. She tried every
U||   conceivable method, but time hung heavily. It was not quite peep of
U||   day, however, when she laid her well-worn family Bible aside. It had
U||   been her mother’s, and amid all the anxieties and tribulations incident
U||   to the life of a woman who had free negroes and a miserable husband to
U||   manage, it had been her mainstay and comfort. She had frequently read
U||   it in anger, page after page, without knowing what was contained in the
U||   lines. But eventually the words became intelligible and took meaning.
U||   She wrested consolation from it by mere force of will.
U||   And so on this occasion when she closed the book the fierce anger was
U||   gone.
U||   She was not a hard woman naturally. Fate had brought her conditions
U||   which covered up the woman heart within her, but though it lay deep, it
U||   was there still. As she sat with folded hands her eyes fell upon—what?
U||   The pink bonnet with the blue plume!
U||   It may appear strange to those who do not understand such natures, but
U||   to me her next action was perfectly natural. She burst into a
U||   convulsive laugh; then, seizing the queer object, bent her face upon it
U||   and sobbed hysterically. When the storm was over, very tenderly she
U||   laid the gift aside, and bareheaded passed out into the night.
U||   For a half-hour she stood at the end of the lane, and then hungry
U||   Balaam and his master hove in sight. Reaching out her hand, she checked
U||   the beast.
U||   “William,” said she, very gently, “where is the mule?”
U||   The elder had been asleep. He woke and gazed upon her blankly.
U||   “What mule, Hannah?”
U||   “The mule you rode to town.”
U||   For one full minute the elder studied her face. Then it burst from his
U||   lips:
U||   “Well, bless me! if I didn’t bring Balaam and forgit the mule!”
U||   The woman laughed till her eyes ran water.
U||   “William,” said she, “you’re drunk.”
U||   “Hannah,” said he, meekly, “I know it. The truth is, Hannah, I—”
U||   “Never mind, now, William,” she said, gently. “You are tired and
U||   hungry. Come into the house, husband.”
U||   Leading Balaam, she disappeared down the lane; and when, a few minutes
U||   later, Hannah Brown and her husband entered through the light that
U||   streamed out of the open door her arms were around him, and her face
U||   upturned to his.

U||THE HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MR. PINK FLUKER[59][20]
U||   By Richard Malcolm Johnston (1822–1898)
U||  I
U||   Mr. Peterson Fluker, generally called Pink, for his fondness for as
U||   stylish dressing as he could afford, was one of that sort of men who
U||   habitually seem busy and efficient when they are not. He had the
U||   bustling activity often noticeable in men of his size, and in one way
U||   and another had made up, as he believed, for being so much smaller than
U||   most of his adult acquaintance of the male sex. Prominent among his
U||   achievements on that line was getting married to a woman who, among
U||   other excellent gifts, had that of being twice as big as her husband.
U||   “Fool who?” on the day after his marriage he had asked, with a look at
U||   those who had often said that he was too little to have a wife.
U||   They had a little property to begin with, a couple of hundreds of
U||   acres, and two or three negroes apiece. Yet, except in the natural
U||   increase of the latter, the accretions of worldly estate had been
U||   inconsiderable till now, when their oldest child, Marann, was some
U||   fifteen years old. These accretions had been saved and taken care of by
U||   Mrs. Fluker, who was as staid and silent as he was mobile and voluble.
U||   Mr. Fluker often said that it puzzled him how it was that he made
U||   smaller crops than most of his neighbors, when, if not always
U||   convincing, he could generally put every one of them to silence in
U||   discussions upon agricultural topics. This puzzle had led him to not
U||   unfrequent ruminations in his mind as to whether or not his vocation
U||   might lie in something higher than the mere tilling of the ground.
U||   These ruminations had lately taken a definite direction, and it was
U||   after several conversations which he had held with his friend Matt
U||   Pike.
U||   Mr. Matt Pike was a bachelor of some thirty summers, a foretime clerk
U||   consecutively in each of the two stores of the village, but latterly a
U||   trader on a limited scale in horses, wagons, cows, and similar objects
U||   of commerce, and at all times a politician. His hopes of holding office
U||   had been continually disappointed until Mr. John Sanks became sheriff,
U||   and rewarded with a deputyship some important special service rendered
U||   by him in the late very close canvass. Now was a chance to rise, Mr.
U||   Pike thought. All he wanted, he had often said, was a start. Politics,
U||   I would remark, however, had been regarded by Mr. Pike as a means
U||   rather than an end. It is doubtful if he hoped to become governor of
U||   the state, at least before an advanced period in his career. His main
U||   object now was to get money, and he believed that official position
U||   would promote him in the line of his ambition faster than was possible
U||   to any private station, by leading him into more extensive acquaintance
U||   with mankind, their needs, their desires, and their caprices. A deputy
U||   sheriff, provided that lawyers were not too indulgent in allowing
U||   acknowledgment of service of court processes, in postponing levies and
U||   sales, and in settlement of litigated cases, might pick up three
U||   hundred dollars, a good sum for those times, a fact which Mr. Pike had
U||   known and pondered long.
U||   It happened just about then that the arrears of rent for the village
U||   hotel had so accumulated on Mr. Spouter, the last occupant, that the
U||   owner, an indulgent man, finally had said, what he had been expected
U||   for years and years to say, that he could not wait on Mr. Spouter
U||   forever and eternally. It was at this very nick, so to speak, that Mr.
U||   Pike made to Mr. Fluker the suggestion to quit a business so far
U||   beneath his powers, sell out, or rent out, or tenant out, or do
U||   something else with his farm, march into town, plant himself upon the
U||   ruins of Jacob Spouter, and begin his upward soar.
U||   Now Mr. Fluker had many and many a time acknowledged that he had
U||   ambition; so one night he said to his wife:
U||   “You see how it is here, Nervy. Farmin’ somehow don’t suit my talons. I
U||   need to be flung more ’mong people to fetch out what’s in me. Then
U||   thar’s Marann, which is gittin’ to be nigh on to a growd-up woman; an’
U||   the child need the s’iety which you ’bleeged to acknowledge is sca’ce
U||   about here, six mile from town. Your brer Sam can stay here an’ raise
U||   butter, chickens, eggs, pigs, an’—an’—an’ so forth. Matt Pike say he
U||   jes’ know they’s money in it, an’ special with a housekeeper keerful
U||   an’ equinomical like you.”
U||   It is always curious the extent of influence that some men have upon
U||   wives who are their superiors. Mrs. Fluker, in spite of accidents, had
U||   ever set upon her husband a value that was not recognized outside of
U||   his family. In this respect there seems a surprising compensation in
U||   human life. But this remark I make only in passing. Mrs. Fluker,
U||   admitting in her heart that farming was not her husband’s forte, hoped,
U||   like a true wife, that it might be found in the new field to which he
U||   aspired. Besides, she did not forget that her brother Sam had said to
U||   her several times privately that if his brer Pink wouldn’t have so many
U||   notions and would let him alone in his management, they would all do
U||   better. She reflected for a day or two, and then said:
U||   “Maybe it’s best, Mr. Fluker. I’m willin’ to try it for a year, anyhow.
U||   We can’t lose much by that. As for Matt Pike, I hain’t the confidence
U||   in him you has. Still, he bein’ a boarder and deputy sheriff, he might
U||   accidentally do us some good. I’ll try it for a year providin’ you’ll
U||   fetch me the money as it’s paid in, for you know I know how to manage
U||   that better’n you do, and you know I’ll try to manage it and all the
U||   rest of the business for the best.”
U||   To this provision Mr. Fluker gave consent, qualified by the claim that
U||   he was to retain a small margin for indispensable personal exigencies.
U||   For he contended, perhaps with justice, that no man in the responsible
U||   position he was about to take ought to be expected to go about, or sit
U||   about, or even lounge about, without even a continental red in his
U||   pocket.
U||   The new house—I say new because tongue could not tell the amount of
U||   scouring, scalding, and whitewashing that that excellent housekeeper
U||   had done before a single stick of her furniture went into it—the new
U||   house, I repeat, opened with six eating boarders at ten dollars a month
U||   apiece, and two eating and sleeping at eleven, besides Mr. Pike, who
U||   made a special contract. Transient custom was hoped to hold its own,
U||   and that of the county people under the deputy’s patronage and
U||   influence to be considerably enlarged.
U||   In words and other encouragement Mr. Pike was pronounced. He could
U||   commend honestly, and he did so cordially.
U||   “The thing to do, Pink, is to have your prices reg’lar, and make people
U||   pay up reg’lar. Ten dollars for eatin’, jes’ so; eleb’n for eatin’ an’
U||   sleepin’; half a dollar for dinner, jes’ so; quarter apiece for
U||   breakfast, supper, and bed, is what I call reason’ble bo’d. As for me,
U||   I sca’cely know how to rig’late, because, you know, I’m a’ officer now,
U||   an’ in course I natchel has to be away sometimes an’ on expenses at
U||   ’tother places, an’ it seem like some ’lowance ought by good rights to
U||   be made for that; don’t you think so?”
U||   “Why, matter o’ course, Matt; what you think? I ain’t so powerful good
U||   at figgers. Nervy is. S’posen you speak to her ’bout it.”
U||   “Oh, that’s perfec’ unuseless, Pink. I’m a’ officer o’ the law, Pink,
U||   an’ the law consider women—well, I may say the law, she deal ’ith men,
U||   not women, an’ she expect her officers to understan’ figgers, an’ if I
U||   hadn’t o’ understood figgers Mr. Sanks wouldn’t or darsnt’ to ’p’int me
U||   his dep’ty. Me ’n’ you can fix them terms. Now see here, reg’lar
U||   bo’d—eatin’ bo’d, I mean—is ten dollars, an’ sleepin’ and singuil meals
U||   is ’cordin’ to the figgers you’ve sot for ’em. Ain’t that so? Jes’ so.
U||   Now, Pink, you an’ me’ll keep a runnin’ account, you a-chargin’ for
U||   reg’lar bo’d, an’ I a’lowin’ to myself credics for my absentees,
U||   accordin’ to transion customers an’ singuil mealers an’ sleepers. Is
U||   that fa’r, er is it not fa’r?”
U||   Mr. Fluker turned his head, and after making or thinking he had made a
U||   calculation, answered:
U||   “That’s—that seem fa’r, Matt.”
U||   “Cert’nly ’tis, Pink; I knowed you’d say so, an’ you know I’d never
U||   wish to be nothin’ but fa’r ’ith people I like, like I do you an’ your
U||   wife. Let that be the understandin’, then, betwix’ us. An’ Pink, let
U||   the understandin’ be jes’ betwix’ us, for I’ve saw enough o’ this world
U||   to find out that a man never makes nothin’ by makin’ a blowin’ horn o’
U||   his business. You make the t’others pay up spuntial, monthly. You ’n’
U||   me can settle whensomever it’s convenant, say three months from to-day.
U||   In course I shall talk up for the house whensomever and wharsomever I
U||   go or stay. You know that. An’ as for my bed,” said Mr. Pike finally,
U||   “whensomever I ain’t here by bed-time, you welcome to put any transion
U||   person in it, an’ also an’ likewise, when transion custom is pressin’,
U||   and you cramped for beddin’, I’m willin’ to give it up for the time
U||   bein’; an’ rather’n you should be cramped too bad, I’ll take my chances
U||   somewhars else, even if I has to take a pallet at the head o’ the
U||   sta’r-steps.”
U||   “Nervy,” said Mr. Fluker to his wife afterwards, “Matt Pike’s a
U||   sensibler an’ a friendlier an’ a ’commodatiner feller’n I thought.”
U||   Then, without giving details of the contract, he mentioned merely the
U||   willingness of their boarder to resign his bed on occasions of pressing
U||   emergency.
U||   “He’s talked mighty fine to me and Marann,” answered Mrs. Fluker.
U||   “We’ll see how he holds out. One thing I do not like of his doin’, an’
U||   that’s the talkin’ ’bout Sim Marchman to Marann, an’ makin’ game o’ his
U||   country ways, as he call ’em. Sech as that ain’t right.”
U||   It may be as well to explain just here that Simeon Marchman, the person
U||   just named by Mrs. Fluker, a stout, industrious young farmer, residing
U||   with his parents in the country near by where the Flukers had dwelt
U||   before removing to town, had been eying Marann for a year or two, and
U||   waiting upon her fast-ripening womanhood with intentions that, he
U||   believed to be hidden in his own breast, though he had taken less pains
U||   to conceal them from Marann than from the rest of his acquaintance. Not
U||   that he had ever told her of them in so many words, but—Oh, I need not
U||   stop here in the midst of this narration to explain how such intentions
U||   become known, or at least strongly suspected by girls, even those less
U||   bright than Marann Fluker. Simeon had not cordially indorsed the
U||   movement into town, though, of course, knowing it was none of his
U||   business, he had never so much as hinted opposition. I would not be
U||   surprised, also, if he reflected that there might be some selfishness
U||   in his hostility, or at least that it was heightened by apprehensions
U||   personal to himself.
U||   Considering the want of experience in the new tenants, matters went on
U||   remarkably well. Mrs. Fluker, accustomed to rise from her couch long
U||   before the lark, managed to the satisfaction of all,—regular boarders,
U||   single-meal takers, and transient people. Marann went to the village
U||   school, her mother dressing her, though with prudent economy, as neatly
U||   and almost as tastefully as any of her schoolmates; while, as to study,
U||   deportment, and general progress, there was not a girl in the whole
U||   school to beat her, I don’t care who she was.
U||  II
U||   During a not inconsiderable period Mr. Fluker indulged the honorable
U||   conviction that at last he had found the vein in which his best talents
U||   lay, and he was happy in foresight of the prosperity and felicity which
U||   that discovery promised to himself and his family. His native activity
U||   found many more objects for its exertion than before. He rode out to
U||   the farm, not often, but sometimes, as a matter of duty, and was forced
U||   to acknowledge that Sam was managing better than could have been
U||   expected in the absence of his own continuous guidance. In town he
U||   walked about the hotel, entertained the guests, carved at the meals,
U||   hovered about the stores, the doctors’ offices, the wagon and
U||   blacksmith shops, discussed mercantile, medical, mechanical questions
U||   with specialists in all these departments, throwing into them all more
U||   and more of politics as the intimacy between him and his patron and
U||   chief boarder increased.
U||   Now as to that patron and chief boarder. The need of extending his
U||   acquaintance seemed to press upon Mr. Pike with ever-increasing weight.
U||   He was here and there, all over the county; at the county-seat, at the
U||   county villages, at justices’ courts, at executors’ and administrators’
U||   sales, at quarterly and protracted religious meetings, at barbecues of
U||   every dimension, on hunting excursions and fishing frolics, at social
U||   parties in all neighborhoods. It got to be said of Mr. Pike that a
U||   freer acceptor of hospitable invitations, or a better appreciator of
U||   hospitable intentions, was not and needed not to be found possibly in
U||   the whole state. Nor was this admirable deportment confined to the
U||   county in which he held so high official position. He attended, among
U||   other occasions less public, the spring sessions of the supreme and
U||   county courts in the four adjoining counties: the guest of acquaintance
U||   old and new over there. When starting upon such travels, he would
U||   sometimes breakfast with his traveling companion in the village, and,
U||   if somewhat belated in the return, sup with him also.
U||   Yet, when at Flukers’, no man could have been a more cheerful and
U||   otherwise satisfactory boarder than Mr. Matt Pike. He praised every
U||   dish set before him, bragged to their very faces of his host and
U||   hostess, and in spite of his absences was the oftenest to sit and chat
U||   with Marann when her mother would let her go into the parlor. Here and
U||   everywhere about the house, in the dining-room, in the passage, at the
U||   foot of the stairs, he would joke with Marann about her country beau,
U||   as he styled poor Sim Marchman, and he would talk as though he was
U||   rather ashamed of Sim, and wanted Marann to string her bow for higher
U||   game.
U||   Brer Sam did manage well, not only the fields, but the yard. Every
U||   Saturday of the world he sent in something or other to his sister. I
U||   don’t know whether I ought to tell it or not, but for the sake of what
U||   is due to pure veracity I will. On as many as three different occasions
U||   Sim Marchman, as if he had lost all self-respect, or had not a particle
U||   of tact, brought in himself, instead of sending by a negro, a bucket of
U||   butter and a coop of spring chickens as a free gift to Mrs. Fluker. I
U||   do think, on my soul, that Mr. Matt Pike was much amused by such
U||   degradation—however, he must say that they were all first-rate. As for
U||   Marann, she was very sorry for Sim, and wished he had not brought these
U||   good things at all.
U||   Nobody knew how it came about; but when the Flukers had been in town
U||   somewhere between two and three months, Sim Marchman, who (to use his
U||   own words) had never bothered her a great deal with his visits, began
U||   to suspect that what few he made were received by Marann lately with
U||   less cordiality than before; and so one day, knowing no better, in his
U||   awkward, straightforward country manners, he wanted to know the reason
U||   why. Then Marann grew distant, and asked Sim the following question:
U||   “You know where Mr. Pike’s gone, Mr. Marchman?”
U||   Now the fact was, and she knew it, that Marann Fluker had never before,
U||   not since she was born, addressed that boy as Mister.
U||   The visitor’s face reddened and reddened.
U||   “No,” he faltered in answer; “no—no—ma’am, I should say. I—I don’t know
U||   where Mr. Pike’s gone.”
U||   Then he looked around for his hat, discovered it in time, took it into
U||   his hands, turned it around two or three times, then, bidding good-bye
U||   without shaking hands, took himself off.
U||   Mrs. Fluker liked all the Marchmans, and she was troubled somewhat when
U||   she heard of the quickness and manner of Sim’s departure; for he had
U||   been fully expected by her to stay to dinner.
U||   “Say he didn’t even shake hands, Marann? What for? What you do to him?”
U||   “Not one blessed thing, ma; only he wanted to know why I wasn’t gladder
U||   to see him.” Then Marann looked indignant.
U||   “Say them words, Marann?”
U||   “No, but he hinted ’em.”
U||   “What did you say then?”
U||   “I just asked, a-meaning nothing in the wide world, ma—I asked him if
U||   he knew where Mr. Pike had gone.”
U||   “And that were answer enough to hurt his feelin’s. What you want to
U||   know where Matt Pike’s gone for, Marann?”
U||   “I didn’t care about knowing, ma, but I didn’t like the way Sim
U||   talked.”
U||   “Look here, Marann. Look straight at me. You’ll be mighty fur off your
U||   feet if you let Matt Pike put things in your head that hain’t no
U||   business a-bein’ there, and special if you find yourself a-wantin’ to
U||   know where he’s a-perambulatin’ in his everlastin’ meanderin’s. Not a
U||   cent has he paid for his board, and which your pa say he have a’
U||   understandin’ with him about allowin’ for his absentees, which is all
U||   right enough, but which it’s now goin’ on to three mont’s, and what is
U||   comin’ to us I need and I want. He ought, your pa ought to let me
U||   bargain with Matt Pike, because he know he don’t understan’ figgers
U||   like Matt Pike. He don’t know exactly what the bargain were; for I’ve
U||   asked him, and he always begins with a multiplyin’ of words and never
U||   answers me.”
U||   On his next return from his travels Mr. Pike noticed a coldness in Mrs.
U||   Fluker’s manner, and this enhanced his praise of the house. The last
U||   week of the third month came. Mr. Pike was often noticed, before and
U||   after meals, standing at the desk in the hotel office (called in those
U||   times the bar-room) engaged in making calculations. The day before the
U||   contract expired Mrs. Fluker, who had not indulged herself with a
U||   single holiday since they had been in town, left Marann in charge of
U||   the house, and rode forth, spending part of the day with Mrs. Marchman,
U||   Sim’s mother. All were glad to see her, of course, and she returned
U||   smartly, freshened by the visit. That night she had a talk with Marann,
U||   and oh, how Marann did cry!
U||   The very last day came. Like insurance policies, the contract was to
U||   expire at a certain hour. Sim Marchman came just before dinner, to
U||   which he was sent for by Mrs. Fluker, who had seen him as he rode into
U||   town.
U||   “Hello, Sim,” said Mr. Pike as he took his seat opposite him. “You
U||   here? What’s the news in the country? How’s your health? How’s crops?”
U||   “Jest mod’rate, Mr. Pike. Got little business with you after dinner, ef
U||   you can spare time.”
U||   “All right. Got a little matter with Pink here first. ’Twon’t take
U||   long. See you arfter amejiant, Sim.”
U||   Never had the deputy been more gracious and witty. He talked and
U||   talked, outtalking even Mr. Fluker; he was the only man in town who
U||   could do that. He winked at Marann as he put questions to Sim, some of
U||   the words employed in which Sim had never heard before. Yet Sim held up
U||   as well as he could, and after dinner followed Marann with some little
U||   dignity into the parlor. They had not been there more than ten minutes
U||   when Mrs. Fluker was heard to walk rapidly along the passage leading
U||   from the dining-room, to enter her own chamber for only a moment, then
U||   to come out and rush to the parlor door with the gig-whip in her hand.
U||   Such uncommon conduct in a woman like Mrs. Pink Fluker of course needs
U||   explanation.
U||   When all the other boarders had left the house, the deputy and Mr.
U||   Fluker having repaired to the bar-room, the former said:
U||   “Now, Pink, for our settlement, as you say your wife think we better
U||   have one. I’d ’a’ been willin’ to let accounts keep on a-runnin’,
U||   knowin’ what a straightforrards sort o’ man you was. Your count, ef I
U||   ain’t mistakened, is jes’ thirty-three dollars, even money. Is that so,
U||   or is it not?”
U||   “That’s it, to a dollar, Matt. Three times eleben make thirty-three,
U||   don’t it?”
U||   “It do, Pink, or eleben times three, jes’ which you please. Now here’s
U||   my count, on which you’ll see, Pink, that not nary cent have I charged
U||   for infloonce. I has infloonced a consider’ble custom to this house, as
U||   you know, bo’din’ and transion. But I done that out o’ my respects of
U||   you an’ Missis Fluker, an’ your keepin’ of a fa’r—I’ll say, as I’ve
U||   said freckwent, a very fa’r house. I let them infloonces go to
U||   friendship, ef you’ll take it so. Will you, Pink Fluker?”
U||   “Cert’nly, Matt, an’ I’m a thousand times obleeged to you, an’—”
U||   “Say no more, Pink, on that p’int o’ view. Ef I like a man, I know how
U||   to treat him. Now as to the p’ints o’ absentees, my business as dep’ty
U||   sheriff has took me away from this inconsider’ble town freckwent,
U||   hain’t it?”
U||   “It have, Matt, er somethin’ else, more’n I were a expectin’, an’—”
U||   “Jes’ so. But a public officer, Pink, when jooty call on him to go, he
U||   got to go; in fack he got to goth, as the Scripture say, ain’t that
U||   so?”
U||   “I s’pose so, Matt, by good rights, a—a official speakin’.”
U||   Mr. Fluker felt that he was becoming a little confused.
U||   “Jes’ so. Now, Pink, I were to have credics for my absentees ’cordin’
U||   to transion an’ single-meal bo’ders an’ sleepers; ain’t that so?”
U||   “I—I—somethin’ o’ that sort, Matt,” he answered vaguely.
U||   “Jes’ so. Now look here,” drawing from his pocket a paper. “Itom one.
U||   Twenty-eight dinners at half a dollar makes fourteen dollars, don’t it?
U||   Jes’ so. Twenty-five breakfasts at a quarter makes six an’ a quarter,
U||   which make dinners an’ breakfasts twenty an’ a quarter. Foller me up,
U||   as I go up, Pink. Twenty-five suppers at a quarter makes six an’ a
U||   quarter, an’ which them added to the twenty an’ a quarter makes them
U||   twenty-six an’ a half. Foller, Pink, an’ if you ketch me in any
U||   mistakes in the kyarin’ an’ addin’, p’int it out. Twenty-two an’ a half
U||   beds—an’ I say half, Pink, because you ’member one night when them
U||   A’gusty lawyers got here ’bout midnight on their way to co’t, rather’n
U||   have you too bad cramped, I ris to make way for two of ’em; yit as I
U||   had one good nap, I didn’t think I ought to put that down but for half.
U||   Them makes five dollars half an’ seb’n pence, an’ which kyar’d on to
U||   the t’other twenty-six an’ a half, fetches the whole cabool to jes’
U||   thirty-two dollars an’ seb’n pence. But I made up my mind I’d fling out
U||   that seb’n pence, an’ jes’ call it a dollar even money, an’ which
U||   here’s the solid silver.”
U||   In spite of the rapidity with which this enumeration of counter-charges
U||   was made, Mr. Fluker commenced perspiring at the first item, and when
U||   the balance was announced his face was covered with huge drops.
U||   It was at this juncture that Mrs. Fluker, who, well knowing her
U||   husband’s unfamiliarity with complicated accounts, had felt her duty to
U||   be listening near the bar-room door, left, and quickly afterwards
U||   appeared before Marann and Sim as I have represented.
U||   “You think Matt Pike ain’t tryin’ to settle with your pa with a dollar?
U||   I’m goin’ to make him keep his dollar, an’ I’m goin’ to give him
U||   somethin’ to go ’long with it.”
U||   “The good Lord have mercy upon us!” exclaimed Marann, springing up and
U||   catching hold of her mother’s skirts, as she began her advance towards
U||   the bar-room. “Oh, ma! for the Lord’s sake!—Sim, Sim, Sim, if you care
U||   anything for me in this wide world, don’t let ma go into that room!”
U||   “Missis Fluker,” said Sim, rising instantly, “wait jest two minutes
U||   till I see Mr. Pike on some pressin’ business; I won’t keep you over
U||   two minutes a-waitin’.”
U||   He took her, set her down in a chair trembling, looked at her a moment
U||   as she began to weep, then, going out and closing the door, strode
U||   rapidly to the bar-room.
U||   “Let me help you settle your board-bill, Mr. Pike, by payin’ you a
U||   little one I owe you.”
U||   Doubling his fist, he struck out with a blow that felled the deputy to
U||   the floor. Then catching him by his heels, he dragged him out of the
U||   house into the street. Lifting his foot above his face, he said:
U||   “You stir till I tell you, an’ I’ll stomp your nose down even with the
U||   balance of your mean face. ’Tain’t exactly my business how you cheated
U||   Mr. Fluker, though, ’pon my soul, I never knowed a trifliner, lowdowner
U||   trick. But I owed you myself for your talkin’ ’bout and your lyin’
U||   ’bout me, and now I’ve paid you; an’ ef you only knowed it, I’ve saved
U||   you from a gig-whippin’. Now you may git up.”
U||   “Here’s his dollar, Sim,” said Mr. Fluker, throwing it out of the
U||   window. “Nervy say make him take it.”
U||   The vanquished, not daring to refuse, pocketed the coin, and slunk away
U||   amid the jeers of a score of villagers who had been drawn to the scene.
U||   In all human probability the late omission of the shaking of Sim’s and
U||   Marann’s hands was compensated at their parting that afternoon. I am
U||   more confident on this point because at the end of the year those hands
U||   were joined inseparably by the preacher. But this was when they had all
U||   gone back to their old home; for if Mr. Fluker did not become fully
U||   convinced that his mathematical education was not advanced quite enough
U||   for all the exigencies of hotel-keeping, his wife declared that she had
U||   had enough of it, and that she and Marann were going home. Mr. Fluker
U||   may be said, therefore, to have followed, rather than led, his family
U||   on the return.
U||   As for the deputy, finding that if he did not leave it voluntarily he
U||   would be drummed out of the village, he departed, whither I do not
U||   remember if anybody ever knew.

U||THE NICE PEOPLE[61][21]
U||   By Henry Cuyler Bunner (1855–1896)
U||   “They certainly are nice people,” I assented to my wife’s observation,
U||   using the colloquial phrase with a consciousness that it was anything
U||   but “nice” English, “and I’ll bet that their three children are better
U||   brought up than most of——”
U||   “Two children,” corrected my wife.
U||   “Three, he told me.”
U||   “My dear, she said there were two.”
U||   “He said three.”
U||   “You’ve simply forgotten. I’m sure she told me they had only two—a boy
U||   and a girl.”
U||   “Well, I didn’t enter into particulars.”
U||   “No, dear, and you couldn’t have understood him. Two children.”
U||   “All right,” I said; but I did not think it was all right. As a
U||   nearsighted man learns by enforced observation to recognize persons at
U||   a distance when the face is not visible to the normal eye, so the man
U||   with a bad memory learns, almost unconsciously, to listen carefully and
U||   report accurately. My memory is bad; but I had not had time to forget
U||   that Mr. Brewster Brede had told me that afternoon that he had three
U||   children, at present left in the care of his mother-in-law, while he
U||   and Mrs. Brede took their summer vacation.
U||   “Two children,” repeated my wife; “and they are staying with his aunt
U||   Jenny.”
U||   “He told me with his mother-in-law,” I put in. My wife looked at me
U||   with a serious expression. Men may not remember much of what they are
U||   told about children; but any man knows the difference between an aunt
U||   and a mother-in-law.
U||   “But don’t you think they’re nice people?” asked my wife.
U||   “Oh, certainly,” I replied. “Only they seem to be a little mixed up
U||   about their children.”
U||   “That isn’t a nice thing to say,” returned my wife. I could not deny
U||   it.
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   And yet, the next morning, when the Bredes came down and seated
U||   themselves opposite us at table, beaming and smiling in their natural,
U||   pleasant, well-bred fashion, I knew, to a social certainty, that they
U||   were “nice” people. He was a fine-looking fellow in his neat
U||   tennis-flannels, slim, graceful, twenty-eight or thirty years old, with
U||   a Frenchy pointed beard. She was “nice” in all her pretty clothes, and
U||   she herself was pretty with that type of prettiness which outwears most
U||   other types—the prettiness that lies in a rounded figure, a dusky skin,
U||   plump, rosy cheeks, white teeth and black eyes. She might have been
U||   twenty-five; you guessed that she was prettier than she was at twenty,
U||   and that she would be prettier still at forty.
U||   And nice people were all we wanted to make us happy in Mr. Jacobus’s
U||   summer boarding-house on top of Orange Mountain. For a week we had come
U||   down to breakfast each morning, wondering why we wasted the precious
U||   days of idleness with the company gathered around the Jacobus board.
U||   What joy of human companionship was to be had out of Mrs. Tabb and Miss
U||   Hoogencamp, the two middle-aged gossips from Scranton, Pa.—out of Mr.
U||   and Mrs. Biggle, an indurated head-bookkeeper and his prim and
U||   censorious wife—out of old Major Halkit, a retired business man, who,
U||   having once sold a few shares on commission, wrote for circulars of
U||   every stock company that was started, and tried to induce every one to
U||   invest who would listen to him? We looked around at those dull faces,
U||   the truthful indices of mean and barren minds, and decided that we
U||   would leave that morning. Then we ate Mrs. Jacobus’s biscuit, light as
U||   Aurora’s cloudlets, drank her honest coffee, inhaled the perfume of the
U||   late azaleas with which she decked her table, and decided to postpone
U||   our departure one more day. And then we wandered out to take our
U||   morning glance at what we called “our view”; and it seemed to us as if
U||   Tabb and Hoogencamp and Halkit and the Biggleses could not drive us
U||   away in a year.
U||   I was not surprised when, after breakfast, my wife invited the Bredes
U||   to walk with us to “our view.” The Hoogencamp-Biggle-Tabb-Halkit
U||   contingent never stirred off Jacobus’s veranda; but we both felt that
U||   the Bredes would not profane that sacred scene. We strolled slowly
U||   across the fields, passed through the little belt of woods and, as I
U||   heard Mrs. Brede’s little cry of startled rapture, I motioned to Brede
U||   to look up.
U||   “By Jove!” he cried, “heavenly!”
U||   We looked off from the brow of the mountain over fifteen miles of
U||   billowing green, to where, far across a far stretch of pale blue lay a
U||   dim purple line that we knew was Staten Island. Towns and villages lay
U||   before us and under us; there were ridges and hills, uplands and
U||   lowlands, woods and plains, all massed and mingled in that great silent
U||   sea of sunlit green. For silent it was to us, standing in the silence
U||   of a high place—silent with a Sunday stillness that made us listen,
U||   without taking thought, for the sound of bells coming up from the
U||   spires that rose above the tree-tops—the tree-tops that lay as far
U||   beneath us as the light clouds were above us that dropped great shadows
U||   upon our heads and faint specks of shade upon the broad sweep of land
U||   at the mountain’s foot.
U||   “And so that is your view?” asked Mrs. Brede, after a moment; “you are
U||   very generous to make it ours, too.”
U||   Then we lay down on the grass, and Brede began to talk, in a gentle
U||   voice, as if he felt the influence of the place. He had paddled a
U||   canoe, in his earlier days, he said, and he knew every river and creek
U||   in that vast stretch of landscape. He found his landmarks, and pointed
U||   out to us where the Passaic and the Hackensack flowed, invisible to us,
U||   hidden behind great ridges that in our sight were but combings of the
U||   green waves upon which we looked down. And yet, on the further side of
U||   those broad ridges and rises were scores of villages—a little world of
U||   country life, lying unseen under our eyes.
U||   “A good deal like looking at humanity,” he said; “there is such a thing
U||   as getting so far above our fellow men that we see only one side of
U||   them.”
U||   Ah, how much better was this sort of talk than the chatter and gossip
U||   of the Tabb and the Hoogencamp—than the Major’s dissertations upon his
U||   everlasting circulars! My wife and I exchanged glances.
U||   “Now, when I went up the Matterhorn” Mr. Brede began.
U||   “Why, dear,” interrupted his wife, “I didn’t know you ever went up the
U||   Matterhorn.”
U||   “It—it was five years ago,” said Mr. Brede, hurriedly. “I—I didn’t tell
U||   you—when I was on the other side, you know—it was rather
U||   dangerous—well, as I was saying—it looked—oh, it didn’t look at all
U||   like this.”
U||   A cloud floated overhead, throwing its great shadow over the field
U||   where we lay. The shadow passed over the mountain’s brow and reappeared
U||   far below, a rapidly decreasing blot, flying eastward over the golden
U||   green. My wife and I exchanged glances once more.
U||   Somehow, the shadow lingered over us all. As we went home, the Bredes
U||   went side by side along the narrow path, and my wife and I walked
U||   together.
U||   “Should you think,” she asked me, “that a man would climb the
U||   Matterhorn the very first year he was married?”
U||   “I don’t know, my dear,” I answered, evasively; “this isn’t the first
U||   year I have been married, not by a good many, and I wouldn’t climb
U||   it—for a farm.”
U||   “You know what I mean,” she said.
U||   I did.
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   When we reached the boarding-house, Mr. Jacobus took me aside.
U||   “You know,” he began his discourse, “my wife she uset to live in N’
U||   York!”
U||   I didn’t know, but I said “Yes.”
U||   “She says the numbers on the streets runs criss-cross-like.
U||   Thirty-four’s on one side o’ the street an’ thirty-five on t’other.
U||   How’s that?”
U||   “That is the invariable rule, I believe.”
U||   “Then—I say—these here new folk that you ’n’ your wife seem so mighty
U||   taken up with—d’ye know anything about ’em?”
U||   “I know nothing about the character of your boarders, Mr. Jacobus,” I
U||   replied, conscious of some irritability. “If I choose to associate with
U||   any of them——”
U||   “Jess so—jess so!” broke in Jacobus. “I hain’t nothin’ to say ag’inst
U||   yer sosherbil’ty. But do ye know them?”
U||   “Why, certainly not,” I replied.
U||   “Well—that was all I wuz askin’ ye. Ye see, when he come here to take
U||   the rooms—you wasn’t here then—he told my wife that he lived at number
U||   thirty-four in his street. An’ yistiddy she told her that they lived at
U||   number thirty-five. He said he lived in an apartment-house. Now there
U||   can’t be no apartment-house on two sides of the same street, kin they?”
U||   “What street was it?” I inquired, wearily.
U||   “Hundred ’n’ twenty-first street.”
U||   “May be,” I replied, still more wearily. “That’s Harlem. Nobody knows
U||   what people will do in Harlem.”
U||   I went up to my wife’s room.
U||   “Don’t you think it’s queer?” she asked me.
U||   “I think I’ll have a talk with that young man to-night,” I said, “and
U||   see if he can give some account of himself.”
U||   “But, my dear,” my wife said, gravely, “she doesn’t know whether
U||   they’ve had the measles or not.”
U||   “Why, Great Scott!” I exclaimed, “they must have had them when they
U||   were children.”
U||   “Please don’t be stupid,” said my wife. “I meant their children.”
U||   After dinner that night—or rather, after supper, for we had dinner in
U||   the middle of the day at Jacobus’s—I walked down the long verandah to
U||   ask Brede, who was placidly smoking at the other end, to accompany me
U||   on a twilight stroll. Half way down I met Major Halkit.
U||   “That friend of yours,” he said, indicating the unconscious figure at
U||   the further end of the house, “seems to be a queer sort of a Dick. He
U||   told me that he was out of business, and just looking round for a
U||   chance to invest his capital. And I’ve been telling him what an
U||   everlasting big show he had to take stock in the Capitoline Trust
U||   Company—starts next month—four million capital—I told you all about it.
U||   ‘Oh, well,’ he says, ‘let’s wait and think about it.’ ‘Wait!’ says I,
U||   ‘the Capitoline Trust Company won’t wait for you, my boy. This is
U||   letting you in on the ground floor,’ says I, ‘and it’s now or never.’
U||   ‘Oh, let it wait,’ says he. I don’t know what’s in-to the man.”
U||   “I don’t know how well he knows his own business, Major,” I said as I
U||   started again for Brede’s end of the veranda. But I was troubled none
U||   the less. The Major could not have influenced the sale of one share of
U||   stock in the Capitoline Company. But that stock was a great investment;
U||   a rare chance for a purchaser with a few thousand dollars. Perhaps it
U||   was no more remarkable that Brede should not invest than that I should
U||   not—and yet, it seemed to add one circumstance more to the other
U||   suspicious circumstances.
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   When I went upstairs that evening, I found my wife putting her hair to
U||   bed—I don’t know how I can better describe an operation familiar to
U||   every married man. I waited until the last tress was coiled up, and
U||   then I spoke:
U||   “I’ve talked with Brede,” I said, “and I didn’t have to catechize him.
U||   He seemed to feel that some sort of explanation was looked for, and he
U||   was very outspoken. You were right about the children—that is, I must
U||   have misunderstood him. There are only two. But the Matterhorn episode
U||   was simple enough. He didn’t realize how dangerous it was until he had
U||   got so far into it that he couldn’t back out; and he didn’t tell her,
U||   because he’d left her here, you see, and under the circumstances——”
U||   “Left her here!” cried my wife. “I’ve been sitting with her the whole
U||   afternoon, sewing, and she told me that he left her at Geneva, and came
U||   back and took her to Basle, and the baby was born there—now I’m sure,
U||   dear, because I asked her.”
U||   “Perhaps I was mistaken when I thought he said she was on this side of
U||   the water,” I suggested, with bitter, biting irony.
U||   “You poor dear, did I abuse you?” said my wife. “But, do you know, Mrs.
U||   Tabb said that she didn’t know how many lumps of sugar he took in his
U||   coffee. Now that seems queer, doesn’t it?”
U||   It did. It was a small thing. But it looked queer, Very queer.
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   The next morning, it was clear that war was declared against the
U||   Bredes. They came down to breakfast somewhat late, and, as soon as they
U||   arrived, the Biggleses swooped up the last fragments that remained on
U||   their plates, and made a stately march out of the dining-room, Then
U||   Miss Hoogencamp arose and departed, leaving a whole fish-ball on her
U||   plate. Even as Atalanta might have dropped an apple behind her to tempt
U||   her pursuer to check his speed, so Miss Hoogencamp left that fish-ball
U||   behind her, and between her maiden self and contamination.
U||   We had finished our breakfast, my wife and I, before the Bredes
U||   appeared. We talked it over, and agreed that we were glad that we had
U||   not been obliged to take sides upon such insufficient testimony.
U||   After breakfast, it was the custom of the male half of the Jacobus
U||   household to go around the corner of the building and smoke their pipes
U||   and cigars where they would not annoy the ladies. We sat under a
U||   trellis covered with a grapevine that had borne no grapes in the memory
U||   of man. This vine, however, bore leaves, and these, on that pleasant
U||   summer morning, shielded from us two persons who were in earnest
U||   conversation in the straggling, half-dead flower-garden at the side of
U||   the house.
U||   “I don’t want,” we heard Mr. Jacobus say, “to enter in no man’s
U||   pry-vacy; but I do want to know who it may be, like, that I hev in my
U||   house. Now what I ask of you, and I don’t want you to take it as in no
U||   ways personal, is—hev you your merridge-license with you?”
U||   “No,” we heard the voice of Mr. Brede reply. “Have you yours?”
U||   I think it was a chance shot; but it told all the same. The Major (he
U||   was a widower) and Mr. Biggle and I looked at each other; and Mr.
U||   Jacobus, on the other side of the grape-trellis, looked at—I don’t know
U||   what—and was as silent as we were.
U||   Where is your marriage-license, married reader? Do you know? Four men,
U||   not including Mr. Brede, stood or sat on one side or the other of that
U||   grape-trellis, and not one of them knew where his marriage-license was.
U||   Each of us had had one—the Major had had three. But where were they?
U||   Where is yours? Tucked in your best-man’s pocket; deposited in his
U||   desk—or washed to a pulp in his white waistcoat (if white waistcoats be
U||   the fashion of the hour), washed out of existence—can you tell where it
U||   is? Can you—unless you are one of those people who frame that
U||   interesting document and hang it upon their drawing-room walls?
U||   Mr. Brede’s voice arose, after an awful stillness of what seemed like
U||   five minutes, and was, probably, thirty seconds:
U||   “Mr. Jacobus, will you make out your bill at once, and let me pay it? I
U||   shall leave by the six o’clock train. And will you also send the wagon
U||   for my trunks?”
U||   “I hain’t said I wanted to hev ye leave——” began Mr. Jacobus; but Brede
U||   cut him short.
U||   “Bring me your bill.”
U||   “But,” remonstrated Jacobus, “ef ye ain’t——”
U||   “Bring me your bill!” said Mr. Brede.
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   My wife and I went out for our morning’s walk. But it seemed to us,
U||   when we looked at “our view,” as if we could only see those invisible
U||   villages of which Brede had told us—that other side of the ridges and
U||   rises of which we catch no glimpse from lofty hills or from the heights
U||   of human self-esteem. We meant to stay out until the Bredes had taken
U||   their departure; but we returned just in time to see Pete, the Jacobus
U||   darkey, the blacker of boots, the brasher of coats, the general
U||   handy-man of the house, loading the Brede trunks on the Jacobus wagon.
U||   And, as we stepped upon the verandah, down came Mrs. Brede, leaning on
U||   Mr. Brede’s arm, as though she were ill; and it was clear that she had
U||   been crying. There were heavy rings about her pretty black eyes.
U||   My wife took a step toward her.
U||   “Look at that dress, dear,” she whispered; “she never thought anything
U||   like this was going to happen when she put that on.”
U||   It was a pretty, delicate, dainty dress, a graceful, narrow-striped
U||   affair. Her hat was trimmed with a narrow-striped silk of the same
U||   colors—maroon and white—and in her hand she held a parasol that matched
U||   her dress.
U||   “She’s had a new dress on twice a day,” said my wife, “but that’s the
U||   prettiest yet. Oh, somehow—I’m awfully sorry they’re going!”
U||   But going they were. They moved toward the steps. Mrs. Brede looked
U||   toward my wife, and my wife moved toward Mrs. Brede. But the ostracized
U||   woman, as though she felt the deep humiliation of her position, turned
U||   sharply away, and opened her parasol to shield her eyes from the sun. A
U||   shower of rice—a half-pound shower of rice—fell down over her pretty
U||   hat and her pretty dress, and fell in a spattering circle on the floor,
U||   outlining her skirts—and there it lay in a broad, uneven band, bright
U||   in the morning sun.
U||   Mrs. Brede was in my wife’s arms, sobbing as if her young heart would
U||   break.
U||   “Oh, you poor, dear, silly children!” my wife cried, as Mrs. Brede
U||   sobbed on her shoulder, “why didn’t you tell us?”
U||   “W-W-W-We didn’t want to be t-t-taken for a b-b-b-b-bridal couple,”
U||   sobbed Mrs. Brede; “and we d-d-didn’t dream what awful lies we’d have
U||   to tell, and all the aw-awful mixed-up-ness of it. Oh, dear, dear,
U||   dear!”
U||     __________________________________________________________________
U||   “Pete!” commanded Mr. Jacobus, “put back them trunks. These folks stays
U||   here’s long’s they wants ter. Mr. Brede”—he held out a large, hard
U||   hand—“I’d orter’ve known better,” he said. And my last doubt of Mr.
U||   Brede vanished as he shook that grimy hand in manly fashion.
U||   The two women were walking off toward “our view,” each with an arm
U||   about the other’s waist—touched by a sudden sisterhood of sympathy.
U||   “Gentlemen,” said Mr. Brede, addressing Jacobus, Biggle, the Major and
U||   me, “there is a hostelry down the street where they sell honest New
U||   Jersey beer. I recognize the obligations of the situation.”
U||   We five men filed down the street. The two women went toward the
U||   pleasant slope where the sunlight gilded the forehead of the great
U||   hill. On Mr. Jacobus’s veranda lay a spattered circle of shining grains
U||   of rice. Two of Mr. Jacobus’s pigeons flew down and picked up the
U||   shining grains, making grateful noises far down in their throats.

U||THE BULLER-PODINGTON COMPACT[63][22]
U||   By Frank Richard Stockton (1834–1902)
U||   “I tell you, William,” said Thomas Buller to his friend Mr. Podington,
U||   “I am truly sorry about it, but I cannot arrange for it this year. Now,
U||   as to my invitation—that is very different.”
U||   “Of course it is different,” was the reply, “but I am obliged to say,
U||   as I said before, that I really cannot accept it.”
U||   Remarks similar to these had been made by Thomas Buller and William
U||   Podington at least once a year for some five years. They were old
U||   friends; they had been schoolboys together and had been associated in
U||   business since they were young men. They had now reached a vigorous
U||   middle age; they were each married, and each had a house in the country
U||   in which he resided for a part of the year. They were warmly attached
U||   to each other, and each was the best friend which the other had in this
U||   world. But during all these years neither of them had visited the other
U||   in his country home.
U||   The reason for this avoidance of each other at their respective rural
U||   residences may be briefly stated. Mr. Buller’s country house was
U||   situated by the sea, and he was very fond of the water. He had a good
U||   cat-boat, which he sailed himself with much judgment and skill, and it
U||   was his greatest pleasure to take his friends and visitors upon little
U||   excursions on the bay. But Mr. Podington was desperately afraid of the
U||   water, and he was particularly afraid of any craft sailed by an
U||   amateur. If his friend Buller would have employed a professional
U||   mariner, of years and experience, to steer and manage his boat,
U||   Podington might have been willing to take an occasional sail; but as
U||   Buller always insisted upon sailing his own boat, and took it ill if
U||   any of his visitors doubted his ability to do so properly, Podington
U||   did not wish to wound the self-love of his friend, and he did not wish
U||   to be drowned. Consequently he could not bring himself to consent to go
U||   to Buller’s house by the sea.
U||   To receive his good friend Buller at his own house in the beautiful
U||   upland region in which he lived would have been a great joy to Mr.
U||   Podington; but Buller could not be induced to visit him. Podington was
U||   very fond of horses and always drove himself, while Buller was more
U||   afraid of horses than he was of elephants or lions. To one or more
U||   horses driven by a coachman of years and experience he did not always
U||   object, but to a horse driven by Podington, who had much experience and
U||   knowledge regarding mercantile affairs, but was merely an amateur
U||   horseman, he most decidedly and strongly objected. He did not wish to
U||   hurt his friend’s feelings by refusing to go out to drive with him, but
U||   he would not rack his own nervous system by accompanying him. Therefore
U||   it was that he had not yet visited the beautiful upland country
U||   residence of Mr. Podington.
U||   At last this state of things grew awkward. Mrs. Buller and Mrs.
U||   Podington, often with their families, visited each other at their
U||   country houses, but the fact that on these occasions they were never
U||   accompanied by their husbands caused more and more gossip among their
U||   neighbors both in the upland country and by the sea.
U||   One day in spring as the two sat in their city office, where Mr.
U||   Podington had just repeated his annual invitation, his friend replied
U||   to him thus:
U||   “William, if I come to see you this summer, will you visit me? The
U||   thing is beginning to look a little ridiculous, and people are talking
U||   about it.”
U||   Mr. Podington put his hand to his brow and for a few moments closed his
U||   eyes. In his mind he saw a cat-boat upon its side, the sails spread out
U||   over the water, and two men, almost entirely immersed in the waves,
U||   making efforts to reach the side of the boat. One of these was getting
U||   on very well—that was Buller. The other seemed about to sink, his arms
U||   were uselessly waving in the air—that was himself. But he opened his
U||   eyes and looked bravely out of the window; it was time to conquer all
U||   this; it was indeed growing ridiculous. Buller had been sailing many
U||   years and had never been upset.
U||   “Yes,” said he; “I will do it; I am ready any time you name.”
U||   Mr. Buller rose and stretched out his hand.
U||   “Good!” said he; “it is a compact!”
U||   Buller was the first to make the promised country visit. He had not
U||   mentioned the subject of horses to his friend, but he knew through Mrs.
U||   Buller that Podington still continued to be his own driver. She had
U||   informed him, however, that at present he was accustomed to drive a big
U||   black horse which, in her opinion, was as gentle and reliable as these
U||   animals ever became, and she could not imagine how anybody could be
U||   afraid of him. So when, the next morning after his arrival, Mr. Buller
U||   was asked by his host if he would like to take a drive, he suppressed a
U||   certain rising emotion and said that it would please him very much.
U||   When the good black horse had jogged along a pleasant road for half an
U||   hour Mr. Buller began to feel that, perhaps, for all these years he had
U||   been laboring under a misconception. It seemed to be possible that
U||   there were some horses to which surrounding circumstances in the shape
U||   of sights and sounds were so irrelevant that they were to a certain
U||   degree entirely safe, even when guided and controlled by an amateur
U||   hand. As they passed some meadow-land, somebody behind a hedge fired a
U||   gun; Mr. Buller was frightened, but the horse was not.
U||   “William,” said Buller, looking cheerfully around him,
U||   “I had no idea that you lived in such a pretty country. In fact, I
U||   might almost call it beautiful. You have not any wide stretch of water,
U||   such as I like so much, but here is a pretty river, those rolling hills
U||   are very charming, and, beyond, you have the blue of the mountains.”
U||   “It is lovely,” said his friend; “I never get tired of driving through
U||   this country. Of course the seaside is very fine, but here we have such
U||   a variety of scenery.”
U||   Mr. Buller could not help thinking that sometimes the seaside was a
U||   little monotonous, and that he had lost a great deal of pleasure by not
U||   varying his summers by going up to spend a week or two with Podington.
U||   “William,” said he, “how long have you had this horse?”
U||   “About two years,” said Mr. Podington; “before I got him, I used to
U||   drive a pair.”
U||   “Heavens!” thought Buller, “how lucky I was not to come two years ago!”
U||   And his regrets for not sooner visiting his friend greatly decreased.
U||   Now they came to a place where the stream, by which the road ran, had
U||   been dammed for a mill and had widened into a beautiful pond.
U||   “There now!” cried Mr. Buller. “That’s what I like. William, you seem
U||   to have everything! This is really a very pretty sheet of water, and
U||   the reflections of the trees over there make a charming picture; you
U||   can’t get that at the seaside, you know.”
U||   Mr. Podington was delighted; his face glowed; he was rejoiced at the
U||   pleasure of his friend. “I tell you, Thomas,” said he, “that——”
U||   “William!” exclaimed Buller, with a sudden squirm in his seat, “what is
U||   that I hear? Is that a train?”
U||   “Yes,” said Mr. Podington, “that is the ten-forty, up.”
U||   “Does it come near here?” asked Mr. Buller, nervously. “Does it go over
U||   that bridge?”
U||   “Yes,” said Podington, “but it can’t hurt us, for our road goes under
U||   the bridge; we are perfectly safe; there is no risk of accident.”
U||   “But your horse! Your horse!” exclaimed Buller, as the train came
U||   nearer and nearer. “What will he do?”
U||   “Do?” said Podington; “he’ll do what he is doing now; he doesn’t mind
U||   trains.”
U||   “But look here, William,” exclaimed Buller, “it will get there just as
U||   we do; no horse could stand a roaring up in the air like that!”
U||   Podington laughed. “He would not mind it in the least,” said he.
U||   “Come, come now,” cried Buller. “Really, I can’t stand this! Just stop
U||   a minute, William, and let me get out. It sets all my nerves
U||   quivering.”
U||   Mr. Podington smiled with a superior smile. “Oh, you needn’t get out,”
U||   said he; “there’s not the least danger in the world. But I don’t want
U||   to make you nervous, and I will turn around and drive the other way.”
U||   “But you can’t!” screamed Buller. “This road is not wide enough, and
U||   that train is nearly here. Please stop!”
U||   The imputation that the road was not wide enough for him to turn was
U||   too much for Mr. Podington to bear. He was very proud of his ability to
U||   turn a vehicle in a narrow place.
U||   “Turn!” said he; “that’s the easiest thing in the world. See; a little
U||   to the right, then a back, then a sweep to the left and we will be
U||   going the other way.” And instantly he began the maneuver in which he
U||   was such an adept.
U||   “Oh, Thomas!” cried Buller, half rising in his seat, “that train is
U||   almost here!”
U||   “And we are almost——” Mr. Podington was about to say “turned around,”
U||   but he stopped. Mr. Buller’s exclamations had made him a little
U||   nervous, and, in his anxiety to turn quickly, he had pulled upon his
U||   horse’s bit with more energy than was actually necessary, and his
U||   nervousness being communicated to the horse, that animal backed with
U||   such extraordinary vigor that the hind wheels of the wagon went over a
U||   bit of grass by the road and into the water. The sudden jolt gave a new
U||   impetus to Mr. Buller’s fears.
U||   “You’ll upset!” he cried, and not thinking of what he was about, he
U||   laid hold of his friend’s arm. The horse, startled by this sudden jerk
U||   upon his bit, which, combined with the thundering of the train, which
U||   was now on the bridge, made him think that something extraordinary was
U||   about to happen, gave a sudden and forcible start backward, so that not
U||   only the hind wheels of the light wagon, but the fore wheels and his
U||   own hind legs went into the water. As the bank at this spot sloped
U||   steeply, the wagon continued to go backward, despite the efforts of the
U||   agitated horse to find a footing on the crumbling edge of the bank.
U||   “Whoa!” cried Mr. Buller.
U||   “Get up!” exclaimed Mr. Podington, applying his whip upon the plunging
U||   beast.
U||   But exclamations and castigations had no effect upon the horse. The
U||   original bed of the stream ran close to the road, and the bank was so
U||   steep and the earth so soft that it was impossible for the horse to
U||   advance or even maintain his footing. Back, back he went, until the
U||   whole equipage was in the water and the wagon was afloat.
U||   This vehicle was a road wagon, without a top, and the joints of its
U||   box-body were tight enough to prevent the water from immediately
U||   entering it; so, somewhat deeply sunken, it rested upon the water.
U||   There was a current in this part of the pond and it turned the wagon
U||   downstream. The horse was now entirely immersed in the water, with the
U||   exception of his head and the upper part of his neck, and, unable to
U||   reach the bottom with his feet, he made vigorous efforts to swim.
U||   Mr. Podington, the reins and whip in his hands, sat horrified and pale;
U||   the accident was so sudden, he was so startled and so frightened that,
U||   for a moment, he could not speak a word. Mr. Buller, on the other hand,
U||   was now lively and alert. The wagon had no sooner floated away from the
U||   shore than he felt himself at home. He was upon his favorite element;
U||   water had no fears for him. He saw that his friend was nearly
U||   frightened out of his wits, and that, figuratively speaking, he must
U||   step to the helm and take charge of the vessel. He stood up and gazed
U||   about him.
U||   “Put her across stream!” he shouted; “she can’t make headway against
U||   this current. Head her to that clump of trees on the other side; the
U||   bank is lower there, and we can beach her. Move a little the other way,
U||   we must trim boat. Now then, pull on your starboard rein.”
U||   Podington obeyed, and the horse slightly changed his direction.
U||   “You see,” said Buller, “it won’t do to sail straight across, because
U||   the current would carry us down and land us below that spot.”
U||   Mr. Podington said not a word; he expected every moment to see the
U||   horse sink into a watery grave.
U||   “It isn’t so bad after all, is it, Podington? If we had a rudder and a
U||   bit of a sail it would be a great help to the horse. This wagon is not
U||   a bad boat.”
U||   The despairing Podington looked at his feet. “It’s coming in,” he said
U||   in a husky voice. “Thomas, the water is over my shoes!”
U||   “That is so,” said Buller. “I am so used to water I didn’t notice it.
U||   She leaks. Do you carry anything to bail her out with?”
U||   “Bail!” cried Podington, now finding his voice. “Oh, Thomas, we are
U||   sinking!”
U||   “That’s so,” said Buller; “she leaks like a sieve.”
U||   The weight of the running-gear and of the two men was entirely too much
U||   for the buoyancy of the wagon body. The water rapidly rose toward the
U||   top of its sides.
U||   “We are going to drown!” cried Podington, suddenly rising.
U||   “Lick him! Lick him!” exclaimed Buller. “Make him swim faster!”
U||   “There’s nothing to lick,” cried Podington, vainly lashing at the
U||   water, for he could not reach the horse’s head. The poor man was
U||   dreadfully frightened; he had never even imagined it possible that he
U||   should be drowned in his own wagon.
U||   “Whoop!” cried Buller, as the water rose over the sides. “Steady
U||   yourself, old boy, or you’ll go overboard!” And the next moment the
U||   wagon body sunk out of sight.
U||   But it did not go down very far. The deepest part of the channel of the
U||   stream had been passed, and with a bump the wheels struck the bottom.
U||   “Heavens!” exclaimed Buller, “we are aground.”
U||   “Aground!” exclaimed Podington, “Heaven be praised!”
U||   As the two men stood up in the submerged wagon the water was above
U||   their knees, and when Podington looked out over the surface of the
U||   pond, now so near his face, it seemed like a sheet of water he had
U||   never seen before. It was something horrible, threatening to rise and
U||   envelop him. He trembled so that he could scarcely keep his footing.
U||   “William,” said his companion, “you must sit down; if you don’t, you’ll
U||   tumble overboard and be drowned. There is nothing for you to hold to.”
U||   “Sit down,” said Podington, gazing blankly at the water around him, “I
U||   can’t do that!”
U||   At this moment the horse made a slight movement. Having touched bottom
U||   after his efforts in swimming across the main bed of the stream, with a
U||   floating wagon in tow, he had stood for a few moments, his head and
U||   neck well above water, and his back barely visible beneath the surface.
U||   Having recovered his breath, he now thought it was time to move on.
U||   At the first step of the horse Mr. Podington began to totter.
U||   Instinctively he clutched Buller.
U||   “Sit down!” cried the latter, “or you’ll have us both overboard.” There
U||   was no help for it; down sat Mr. Podington; and, as with a great splash
U||   he came heavily upon the seat, the water rose to his waist.
U||   “Ough!” said he. “Thomas, shout for help.”
U||   “No use doing that,” replied Buller, still standing on his nautical
U||   legs; “I don’t see anybody, and I don’t see any boat. We’ll get out all
U||   right. Just you stick tight to the thwart.”
U||   “The what?” feebly asked the other.
U||   “Oh, the seat, I mean. We can get to the shore all right if you steer
U||   the horse straight. Head him more across the pond.”
U||   “I can’t head him,” cried Podington. “I have dropped the reins!”
U||   “Good gracious!” cried Mr. Buller, “that’s bad. Can’t you steer him by
U||   shouting ‘Gee’ and ‘Haw’?”
U||   “No,” said Podington, “he isn’t an ox; but perhaps I can stop him.” And
U||   with as much voice as he could summon, he called out: “Whoa!” and the
U||   horse stopped.
U||   “If you can’t steer him any other way,” said Buller, “we must get the
U||   reins. Lend me your whip.”
U||   “I have dropped that too,” said Podington; “there it floats.”
U||   “Oh, dear,” said Buller, “I guess I’ll have to dive for them; if he
U||   were to run away, we should be in an awful fix.”
U||   “Don’t get out! Don’t get out!” exclaimed Podington. “You can reach
U||   over the dashboard.”
U||   “As that’s under water,” said Buller, “it will be the same thing as
U||   diving; but it’s got to be done, and I’ll try it. Don’t you move now; I
U||   am more used to water than you are.”
U||   Mr. Buller took off his hat and asked his friend to hold it. He thought
U||   of his watch and other contents of his pockets, but there was no place
U||   to put them, so he gave them no more consideration. Then bravely
U||   getting on his knees in the water, he leaned over the dashboard, almost
U||   disappearing from sight. With his disengaged hand Mr. Podington grasped
U||   the submerged coat-tails of his friend.
U||   In a few seconds the upper part of Mr. Buller rose from the water. He
U||   was dripping and puffing, and Mr. Podington could not but think what a
U||   difference it made in the appearance of his friend to have his hair
U||   plastered close to his head.
U||   “I got hold of one of them,” said the sputtering Buller, “but it was
U||   fast to something and I couldn’t get it loose.”
U||   “Was it thick and wide?” asked Podington.
U||   “Yes,” was the answer; “it did seem so.”
U||   “Oh, that was a trace,” said Podington; “I don’t want that; the reins
U||   are thinner and lighter.”
U||   “Now I remember they are,” said Buller. “I’ll go down again.”
U||   Again Mr. Buller leaned over the dashboard, and this time he remained
U||   down longer, and when he came up he puffed and sputtered more than
U||   before.
U||   “Is this it?” said he, holding up a strip of wet leather.
U||   “Yes,” said Podington, “you’ve got the reins.”
U||   “Well, take them, and steer. I would have found them sooner if his tail
U||   had not got into my eyes. That long tail’s floating down there and
U||   spreading itself out like a fan; it tangled itself all around my head.
U||   It would have been much easier if he had been a bob-tailed horse.”
U||   “Now then,” said Podington, “take your hat, Thomas, and I’ll try to
U||   drive.”
U||   Mr. Buller put on his hat, which was the only dry thing about him, and
U||   the nervous Podington started the horse so suddenly that even the
U||   sea-legs of Buller were surprised, and he came very near going backward
U||   into the water; but recovering himself, he sat down.
U||   “I don’t wonder you did not like to do this, William,” said he. “Wet as
U||   I am, it’s ghastly!”
U||   Encouraged by his master’s voice, and by the feeling of the familiar
U||   hand upon his bit, the horse moved bravely on.
U||   But the bottom was very rough and uneven. Sometimes the wheels struck a
U||   large stone, terrifying Mr. Buller, who thought they were going to
U||   upset; and sometimes they sank into soft mud, horrifying Mr. Podington,
U||   who thought they were going to drown.
U||   Thus proceeding, they presented a strange sight. At first Mr. Podington
U||   held his hands above the water as he drove, but he soon found this
U||   awkward, and dropped them to their usual position, so that nothing was
U||   visible above the water but the head and neck of a horse and the heads
U||   and shoulders of two men.
U||   Now the submarine equipage came to a low place in the bottom, and even
U||   Mr. Buller shuddered as the water rose to his chin. Podington gave a
U||   howl of horror, and the horse, with high, uplifted head, was obliged to
U||   swim. At this moment a boy with a gun came strolling along the road,
U||   and hearing Mr. Podington’s cry, he cast his eyes over the water.
U||   Instinctively he raised his weapon to his shoulder, and then, in an
U||   instant, perceiving that the objects he beheld were not aquatic birds,
U||   he dropped his gun and ran yelling down the road toward the mill.
U||   But the hollow in the bottom was a narrow one, and when it was passed
U||   the depth of the water gradually decreased. The back of the horse came
U||   into view, the dashboard became visible, and the bodies and the spirits
U||   of the two men rapidly rose. Now there was vigorous splashing and
U||   tugging, and then a jet black horse, shining as if he had been newly
U||   varnished, pulled a dripping wagon containing two well-soaked men upon
U||   a shelving shore.
U||   “Oh, I am chilled to the bones!” said Podington.
U||   “I should think so,” replied his friend; “if you have got to be wet, it
U||   is a great deal pleasanter under the water.”
U||   There was a field-road on this side of the pond which Podington well
U||   knew, and proceeding along this they came to the bridge and got into
U||   the main road.
U||   “Now we must get home as fast as we can,” cried Podington, “or we shall
U||   both take cold. I wish I hadn’t lost my whip. Hi now! Get along!”
U||   Podington was now full of life and energy, his wheels were on the hard
U||   road, and he was himself again.
U||   When he found his head was turned toward his home, the horse set off at
U||   a great rate.
U||   “Hi there!” cried Podington. “I am so sorry I lost my whip.”
U||   “Whip!” said Buller, holding fast to the side of the seat; “surely you
U||   don’t want him to go any faster than this. And look here, William,” he
U||   added, “it seems to me we are much more likely to take cold in our wet
U||   clothes if we rush through the air in this way. Really, it seems to me
U||   that horse is running away.”
U||   “Not a bit of it,” cried Podington. “He wants to get home, and he wants
U||   his dinner. Isn’t he a fine horse? Look how he steps out!”
U||   “Steps out!” said Buller, “I think I’d like to step out myself. Don’t
U||   you think it would be wiser for me to walk home, William? That will
U||   warm me up.”
U||   “It will take you an hour,” said his friend. “Stay where you are, and
U||   I’ll have you in a dry suit of clothes in less than fifteen minutes.”
U||   “I tell you, William,” said Mr. Buller, as the two sat smoking after
U||   dinner, “what you ought to do; you should never go out driving without
U||   a life-preserver and a pair of oars; I always take them. It would make
U||   you feel safer.”
U||   Mr. Buller went home the next day, because Mr. Podington’s clothes did
U||   not fit him, and his own outdoor suit was so shrunken as to be
U||   uncomfortable. Besides, there was another reason, connected with the
U||   desire of horses to reach their homes, which prompted his return. But
U||   he had not forgotten his compact with his friend, and in the course of
U||   a week he wrote to Podington, inviting him to spend some days with him.
U||   Mr. Podington was a man of honor, and in spite of his recent
U||   unfortunate water experience he would not break his word. He went to
U||   Mr. Buller’s seaside home at the time appointed.
U||   Early on the morning after his arrival, before the family were up, Mr.
U||   Podington went out and strolled down to the edge of the bay. He went to
U||   look at Buller’s boat. He was well aware that he would be asked to take
U||   a sail, and as Buller had driven with him, it would be impossible for
U||   him to decline sailing with Buller; but he must see the boat. There was
U||   a train for his home at a quarter past seven; if he were not on the
U||   premises he could not be asked to sail. If Buller’s boat were a little,
U||   flimsy thing, he would take that train—but he would wait and see.
U||   There was only one small boat anchored near the beach, and a
U||   man—apparently a fisherman—informed Mr. Podington that it belonged to
U||   Mr. Buller. Podington looked at it eagerly; it was not very small and
U||   not flimsy.
U||   “Do you consider that a safe boat?” he asked the fisherman.
U||   “Safe?” replied the man. “You could not upset her if you tried. Look at
U||   her breadth of beam! You could go anywhere in that boat! Are you
U||   thinking of buying her?”
U||   The idea that he would think of buying a boat made Mr. Podington laugh.
U||   The information that it would be impossible to upset the little vessel
U||   had greatly cheered him, and he could laugh.
U||   Shortly after breakfast Mr. Buller, like a nurse with a dose of
U||   medicine, came to Mr. Podington with the expected invitation to take a
U||   sail.
U||   “Now, William,” said his host, “I understand perfectly your feeling
U||   about boats, and what I wish to prove to you is that it is a feeling
U||   without any foundation. I don’t want to shock you or make you nervous,
U||   so I am not going to take you out to-day on the bay in my boat. You are
U||   as safe on the bay as you would be on land—a little safer, perhaps,
U||   under certain circumstances, to which we will not allude—but still it
U||   is sometimes a little rough, and this, at first, might cause you some
U||   uneasiness, and so I am going to let you begin your education in the
U||   sailing line on perfectly smooth water. About three miles back of us
U||   there is a very pretty lake several miles long. It is part of the canal
U||   system which connects the town with the railroad. I have sent my boat
U||   to the town, and we can walk up there and go by the canal to the lake;
U||   it is only about three miles.”
U||   If he had to sail at all, this kind of sailing suited Mr. Podington. A
U||   canal, a quiet lake, and a boat which could not be upset. When they
U||   reached the town the boat was in the canal, ready for them.
U||   “Now,” said Mr. Buller, “you get in and make yourself comfortable. My
U||   idea is to hitch on to a canal-boat and be towed to the lake. The boats
U||   generally start about this time in the morning, and I will go and see
U||   about it.”
U||   Mr. Podington, under the direction of his friend, took a seat in the
U||   stern of the sailboat, and then he remarked:
U||   “Thomas, have you a life-preserver on board? You know I am not used to
U||   any kind of vessel, and I am clumsy. Nothing might happen to the boat,
U||   but I might trip and fall overboard, and I can’t swim.”
U||   “All right,” said Buller; “here’s a life-preserver, and you can put it
U||   on. I want you to feel perfectly safe. Now I will go and see about the
U||   tow.”
U||   But Mr. Buller found that the canal-boats would not start at their
U||   usual time; the loading of one of them was not finished, and he was
U||   informed that he might have to wait for an hour or more. This did not
U||   suit Mr. Buller at all, and he did not hesitate to show his annoyance.
U||   “I tell you, sir, what you can do,” said one of the men in charge of
U||   the boats; “if you don’t want to wait till we are ready to start, we’ll
U||   let you have a boy and a horse to tow you up to the lake. That won’t
U||   cost you much, and they’ll be back before we want ’em.”
U||   The bargain was made, and Mr. Buller joyfully returned to his boat with
U||   the intelligence that they were not to wait for the canal-boats. A long
U||   rope, with a horse attached to the other end of it, was speedily made
U||   fast to the boat, and with a boy at the head of the horse, they started
U||   up the canal.
U||   “Now this is the kind of sailing I like,” said Mr. Podington. “If I
U||   lived near a canal I believe I would buy a boat and train my horse to
U||   tow. I could have a long pair of rope-lines and drive him myself; then
U||   when the roads were rough and bad the canal would always be smooth.”
U||   “This is all very nice,” replied Mr. Buller, who sat by the tiller to
U||   keep the boat away from the bank, “and I am glad to see you in a boat
U||   under any circumstances. Do you know, William, that although I did not
U||   plan it, there could not have been a better way to begin your sailing
U||   education. Here we glide along, slowly and gently, with no possible
U||   thought of danger, for if the boat should suddenly spring a leak, as if
U||   it were the body of a wagon, all we would have to do would be to step
U||   on shore, and by the time you get to the end of the canal you will like
U||   this gentle motion so much that you will be perfectly ready to begin
U||   the second stage of your nautical education.”
U||   “Yes,” said Mr. Podington. “How long did you say this canal is?”
U||   “About three miles,” answered his friend. “Then we will go into the
U||   lock and in a few minutes we shall be on the lake.”
U||   “So far as I am concerned,” said Mr. Podington, “I wish the canal were
U||   twelve miles long. I cannot imagine anything pleasanter than this. If I
U||   lived anywhere near a canal—a long canal, I mean, this one is too
U||   short—I’d—”
U||   “Come, come now,” interrupted Buller. “Don’t be content to stay in the
U||   primary school just because it is easy. When we get on the lake I will
U||   show you that in a boat, with a gentle breeze, such as we are likely to
U||   have to-day, you will find the motion quite as pleasing, and ever so
U||   much more inspiriting. I should not be a bit surprised, William, if
U||   after you have been two or three times on the lake you will ask me—yes,
U||   positively ask me—to take you out on the bay!”
U||   Mr. Podington smiled, and leaning backward, he looked up at the
U||   beautiful blue sky.
U||   “You can’t give me anything better than this, Thomas,” said he; “but
U||   you needn’t think I am weakening; you drove with me, and I will sail
U||   with you.”
U||   The thought came into Buller’s mind that he had done both of these
U||   things with Podington, but he did not wish to call up unpleasant
U||   memories, and said nothing.
U||   About half a mile from the town there stood a small cottage where
U||   house-cleaning was going on, and on a fence, not far from the canal,
U||   there hung a carpet gaily adorned with stripes and spots of red and
U||   yellow.
U||   When the drowsy tow-horse came abreast of the house, and the carpet
U||   caught his eye, he suddenly stopped and gave a start toward the canal.
U||   Then, impressed with a horror of the glaring apparition, he gathered
U||   himself up, and with a bound dashed along the tow-path. The astounded
U||   boy gave a shout, but was speedily left behind. The boat of Mr. Buller
U||   shot forward as if she had been struck by a squall.
U||   The terrified horse sped on as if a red and yellow demon were after
U||   him. The boat bounded, and plunged, and frequently struck the grassy
U||   bank of the canal, as if it would break itself to pieces. Mr. Podington
U||   clutched the boom to keep himself from being thrown out, while Mr.
U||   Buller, both hands upon the tiller, frantically endeavored to keep the
U||   boat from the bank.
U||   “William!” he screamed, “he is running away with us; we shall be dashed
U||   to pieces! Can’t you get forward and cast off that line?”
U||   “What do you mean?” cried Podington, as the boom gave a great jerk as
U||   if it would break its fastenings and drag him overboard.
U||   “I mean untie the tow-line. We’ll be smashed if you don’t! I can’t
U||   leave this tiller. Don’t try to stand up; hold on to the boom and creep
U||   forward. Steady now, or you’ll be overboard!”
U||   Mr. Podington stumbled to the bow of the boat, his efforts greatly
U||   impeded by the big cork life-preserver tied under his arms, and the
U||   motion of the boat was so violent and erratic that he was obliged to
U||   hold on to the mast with one arm and to try to loosen the knot with the
U||   other; but there was a great strain on the rope, and he could do
U||   nothing with one hand.
U||   “Cut it! Cut it!” cried Mr. Buller.
U||   “I haven’t a knife,” replied Podington.
U||   Mr. Buller was terribly frightened; his boat was cutting through the
U||   water as never vessel of her class had sped since sail-boats were
U||   invented, and bumping against the bank as if she were a billiard-ball
U||   rebounding from the edge of a table. He forgot he was in a boat; he
U||   only knew that for the first time in his life he was in a runaway. He
U||   let go the tiller. It was of no use to him.
U||   “William,” he cried, “let us jump out the next time we are near enough
U||   to shore!”
U||   “Don’t do that! Don’t do that!” replied Podington. “Don’t jump out in a
U||   runaway; that is the way to get hurt. Stick to your seat, my boy; he
U||   can’t keep this up much longer. He’ll lose his wind!”
U||   Mr. Podington was greatly excited, but he was not frightened, as Buller
U||   was. He had been in a runaway before, and he could not help thinking
U||   how much better a wagon was than a boat in such a case.
U||   “If he were hitched up shorter and I had a snaffle-bit and a stout pair
U||   of reins,” thought he, “I could soon bring him up.”
U||   But Mr. Buller was rapidly losing his wits. The horse seemed to be
U||   going faster than ever. The boat bumped harder against the bank, and at
U||   one time Buller thought they could turn over.
U||   Suddenly a thought struck him.
U||   “William,” he shouted, “tip that anchor over the side! Throw it in, any
U||   way!”
U||   Mr. Podington looked about him, and, almost under his feet, saw the
U||   anchor. He did not instantly comprehend why Buller wanted it thrown
U||   overboard, but this was not a time to ask questions. The difficulties
U||   imposed by the life-preserver, and the necessity of holding on with one
U||   hand, interfered very much with his getting at the anchor and throwing
U||   it over the side, but at last he succeeded, and just as the boat threw
U||   up her bow as if she were about to jump on shore, the anchor went out
U||   and its line shot after it. There was an irregular trembling of the
U||   boat as the anchor struggled along the bottom of the canal; then there
U||   was a great shock; the boat ran into the bank and stopped; the tow-line
U||   was tightened like a guitar-string, and the horse, jerked back with
U||   great violence, came tumbling in a heap upon the ground.
U||   Instantly Mr. Podington was on the shore and running at the top of his
U||   speed toward the horse. The astounded animal had scarcely begun to
U||   struggle to his feet when Podington rushed upon him, pressed his head
U||   back to the ground, and sat upon it.
U||   “Hurrah!” he cried, waving his hat above his head. “Get out, Buller; he
U||   is all right now!”
U||   Presently Mr. Buller approached, very much shaken up.
U||   “All right?” he said. “I don’t call a horse flat in a road with a man
U||   on his head all right; but hold him down till we get him loose from my
U||   boat. That is the thing to do. William, cast him loose from the boat
U||   before you let him up! What will he do when he gets up?”
U||   “Oh. he’ll be quiet enough when he gets up,” said Podington. “But if
U||   you’ve got a knife you can cut his traces—-I mean that rope—but no, you
U||   needn’t. Here comes the boy. We’ll settle this business in very short
U||   order now.”
U||   When the horse was on his feet, and all connection between the animal
U||   and the boat had been severed, Mr. Podington looked at his friend.
U||   “Thomas,” said he, “you seem to have had a hard time of it. You have
U||   lost your hat and you look as if you had been in a wrestling-match.”
U||   “I have,” replied the other; “I wrestled with that tiller and I wonder
U||   it didn’t throw me out.”
U||   Now approached the boy. “Shall I hitch him on again, sir?” said he.
U||   “He’s quiet enough now.”
U||   “No,” cried Mr. Buller; “I want no more sailing after a horse, and,
U||   besides, we can’t go on the lake with that boat; she has been battered
U||   about so much that she must have opened a dozen seams. The best thing
U||   we can do is to walk home.”
U||   Mr. Podington agreed with his friend that walking home was the best
U||   thing they could do. The boat was examined and found to be leaking, but
U||   not very badly, and when her mast had been unshipped and everything had
U||   been made tight and right on board, she was pulled out of the way of
U||   tow-lines and boats, and made fast until she could be sent for from the
U||   town.
U||   Mr. Buller and Mr. Podington walked back toward the town. They had not
U||   gone very far when they met a party of boys, who, upon seeing them,
U||   burst into unseemly laughter.
U||   “Mister,” cried one of them, “you needn’t be afraid of tumbling into
U||   the canal. Why don’t you take off your life-preserver and let that
U||   other man put it on his head?”
U||   The two friends looked at each other and could not help joining in the
U||   laughter of the boys.
U||   “By George! I forgot all about this,” said Podington, as he unfastened
U||   the cork jacket. “It does look a little super-timid to wear a
U||   life-preserver just because one happens to be walking by the side of a
U||   canal.”
U||   Mr. Buller tied a handkerchief on his head, and Mr. Podington rolled up
U||   his life-preserver and carried it under his arm. Thus they reached the
U||   town, where Buller bought a hat, Podington dispensed with his bundle,
U||   and arrangements were made to bring back the boat.
U||   “Runaway in a sailboat!” exclaimed one of the canal boatmen when he had
U||   heard about the accident. “Upon my word! That beats anything that could
U||   happen to a man!”
U||   “No, it doesn’t,” replied Mr. Buller, quietly. “I have gone to the
U||   bottom in a foundered road-wagon.”
U||   The man looked at him fixedly.
U||   “Was you ever struck in the mud in a balloon?” he asked.
U||   “Not yet,” replied Mr. Buller.
U||   It required ten days to put Mr. Buller’s sailboat into proper
U||   condition, and for ten days Mr. Podington stayed with his friend, and
U||   enjoyed his visit very much. They strolled on the beach, they took long
U||   walks in the back country, they fished from the end of a pier, they
U||   smoked, they talked, and were happy and content.
U||   “Thomas,” said Mr. Podington, on the last evening of his stay, “I have
U||   enjoyed myself very much since I have been down here, and now, Thomas,
U||   if I were to come down again next summer, would you mind—would you
U||   mind, not——”
U||   “I would not mind it a bit,” replied Buller, promptly. “I’ll never so
U||   much as mention it; so you can come along without a thought of it. And
U||   since you have alluded to the subject, William,” he continued, “I’d
U||   like very much to come and see you again; you know my visit was a very
U||   short one this year. That is a beautiful country you live in. Such a
U||   variety of scenery, such an opportunity for walks and rambles! But,
U||   William, if you could only make up your mind not to——”
U||   “Oh, that is all right!” exclaimed Podington. “I do not need to make up
U||   my mind. You come to my house and you will never so much as hear of it.
U||   Here’s my hand upon it!”
U||   “And here’s mine!” said Mr. Buller.
U||   And they shook hands over a new compact.

U||COLONEL STARBOTTLE FOR THE PLAINTIFF[65][23]
U||   By Bret Harte (1839–1902)
U||   It had been a day of triumph for Colonel Starbottle. First, for his
U||   personality, as it would have been difficult to separate the Colonel’s
U||   achievements from his individuality; second, for his oratorical
U||   abilities as a sympathetic pleader; and third, for his functions as the
U||   leading counsel for the Eureka Ditch Company versus the State of
U||   California. On his strictly legal performances in this issue I prefer
U||   not to speak; there were those who denied them, although the jury had
U||   accepted them in the face of the ruling of the half-amused,
U||   half-cynical Judge himself. For an hour they had laughed with the
U||   Colonel, wept with him, been stirred to personal indignation or
U||   patriotic exaltation by his passionate and lofty periods—what else
U||   could they do than give him their verdict? If it was alleged by some
U||   that the American eagle, Thomas Jefferson, and the Resolutions of ’98
U||   had nothing whatever to do with the contest of a ditch company over a
U||   doubtfully worded legislative document; that wholesale abuse of the
U||   State Attorney and his political motives had not the slightest
U||   connection with the legal question raised—it was, nevertheless,
U||   generally accepted that the losing party would have been only too glad
U||   to have the Colonel on their side. And Colonel Starbottle knew this,
U||   as, perspiring, florid, and panting, he rebuttoned the lower buttons of
U||   his blue frock-coat, which had become loosed in an oratorical spasm,
U||   and readjusted his old-fashioned, spotless shirt frill above it as he
U||   strutted from the courtroom amidst the hand-shakings and acclamations
U||   of his friends.
U||   And here an unprecedented thing occurred. The Colonel absolutely
U||   declined spirituous refreshment at the neighboring Palmetto Saloon, and
U||   declared his intention of proceeding directly to his office in the
U||   adjoining square. Nevertheless the Colonel quitted the building alone,
U||   and apparently unarmed except for his faithful gold-headed stick, which
U||   hung as usual from his forearm. The crowd gazed after him with
U||   undisguised admiration of this new evidence of his pluck. It was
U||   remembered also that a mysterious note had been handed to him at the
U||   conclusion of his speech—evidently a challenge from the State Attorney.
U||   It was quite plain that the Colonel—a practised duellist—was hastening
U||   home to answer it.
U||   But herein they were wrong. The note was in a female hand, and simply
U||   requested the Colonel to accord an interview with the writer at the
U||   Colonel’s office as soon as he left the court. But it was an engagement
U||   that the Colonel—as devoted to the fair sex as he was to the “code”—was
U||   no less prompt in accepting. He flicked away the dust from his spotless
U||   white trousers and varnished boots with his handkerchief, and settled
U||   his black cravat under his Byron collar as he neared his office. He was
U||   surprised, however, on opening the door of his private office to find
U||   his visitor already there; he was still more startled to find her
U||   somewhat past middle age and plainly attired. But the Colonel was
U||   brought up in a school of Southern politeness, already antique in the
U||   republic, and his bow of courtesy belonged to the epoch of his shirt
U||   frill and strapped trousers. No one could have detected his
U||   disappointment in his manner, albeit his sentences were short and
U||   incomplete. But the Colonel’s colloquial speech was apt to be
U||   fragmentary incoherencies of his larger oratorical utterances.
U||   “A thousand pardons—for—er—having kept a lady waiting—er!
U||   But—er—congratulations of friends—and—er—courtesy due to
U||   them—er—interfered with—though perhaps only heightened—by
U||   procrastination—pleasure of—ha!” And the Colonel completed his sentence
U||   with a gallant wave of his fat but white and well-kept hand.
U||   “Yes! I came to see you along o’ that speech of yours. I was in court.
U||   When I heard you gettin’ it off on that jury, I says to myself that’s
U||   the kind o’ lawyer I want. A man that’s flowery and convincin’! Just
U||   the man to take up our case.”
U||   “Ah! It’s a matter of business, I see,” said the Colonel, inwardly
U||   relieved, but externally careless. “And—er—may I ask the nature of the
U||   case?”
U||   “Well! it’s a breach-o’-promise suit,” said the visitor, calmly.
U||   If the Colonel had been surprised before, he was now really startled,
U||   and with an added horror that required all his politeness to conceal.
U||   Breach-of-promise cases were his peculiar aversion. He had always held
U||   them to be a kind of litigation which could have been obviated by the
U||   prompt killing of the masculine offender—in which case he would have
U||   gladly defended the killer. But a suit for damages!—damages!—with the
U||   reading of love-letters before a hilarious jury and court, was against
U||   all his instincts. His chivalry was outraged; his sense of humor was
U||   small—and in the course of his career he had lost one or two important
U||   cases through an unexpected development of this quality in a jury.
U||   The woman had evidently noticed his hesitation, but mistook its cause.
U||   “It ain’t me—but my darter.”
U||   The Colonel recovered his politeness. “Ah! I am relieved, my dear
U||   madam! I could hardly conceive a man ignorant enough to—er—er—throw
U||   away such evident good fortune—or base enough to deceive the
U||   trustfulness of womanhood—matured and experienced only in the chivalry
U||   of our sex, ha!”
U||   The woman smiled grimly. “Yes!—it’s my darter, Zaidee Hooker—so ye
U||   might spare some of them pretty speeches for her—before the jury.”
U||   The Colonel winced slightly before this doubtful prospect, but smiled.
U||   “Ha! Yes!—certainly—the jury. But—er—my dear lady, need we go as far as
U||   that? Cannot this affair be settled—er—out of court? Could not
U||   this—er—individual—be admonished—told that he must give
U||   satisfaction—personal satisfaction—for his dastardly conduct—to
U||   —er—near relative—or even valued personal friend? The—er—arrangements
U||   necessary for that purpose I myself would undertake.”
U||   He was quite sincere; indeed, his small black eyes shone with that fire
U||   which a pretty woman or an “affair of honor” could alone kindle. The
U||   visitor stared vacantly at him, and said, slowly:
U||   “And what good is that goin’ to do us?”
U||   “Compel him to—er—perform his promise,” said the Colonel, leaning back
U||   in his chair.
U||   “Ketch him doin’ it!” said the woman, scornfully. “No—that ain’t wot
U||   we’re after. We must make him pay! Damages—and nothin’ short o’ that.”
U||   The Colonel bit his lip. “I suppose,” he said, gloomily, “you have
U||   documentary evidence—written promises and protestations—er—er—
U||   love-letters, in fact?”
U||   “No—nary a letter! Ye see, that’s jest it—and that’s where you come in.
U||   You’ve got to convince that jury yourself. You’ve got to show what it
U||   is—tell the whole story your own way. Lord! to a man like you that’s
U||   nothin’.”
U||   Startling as this admission might have been to any other lawyer,
U||   Starbottle was absolutely relieved by it. The absence of any
U||   mirth-provoking correspondence, and the appeal solely to his own powers
U||   of persuasion, actually struck his fancy. He lightly put aside the
U||   compliment with a wave of his white hand.
U||   “Of course,” said the Colonel, confidently, “there is strongly
U||   presumptive and corroborative evidence? Perhaps you can give me—er—a
U||   brief outline of the affair?”
U||   “Zaidee kin do that straight enough, I reckon,” said the woman; “what I
U||   want to know first is, kin you take the case?”
U||   The Colonel did not hesitate; his curiosity was piqued. “I certainly
U||   can. I have no doubt your daughter will put me in possession of
U||   sufficient facts and details—to constitute what we call—er—a brief.”
U||   “She kin be brief enough—or long enough—for the matter of that,” said
U||   the woman, rising. The Colonel accepted this implied witticism with a
U||   smile.
U||   “And when may I have the pleasure of seeing her?” he asked, politely.
U||   “Well, I reckon as soon as I can trot out and call her. She’s just
U||   outside, meanderin’ in the road—kinder shy, ye know, at first.”
U||   She walked to the door. The astounded Colonel nevertheless gallantly
U||   accompanied her as she stepped out into the street and called, shrilly,
U||   “You Zaidee!”
U||   A young girl here apparently detached herself from a tree and the
U||   ostentatious perusal of an old election poster, and sauntered down
U||   towards the office door. Like her mother, she was plainly dressed;
U||   unlike her, she had a pale, rather refined face, with a demure mouth
U||   and downcast eyes. This was all the Colonel saw as he bowed profoundly
U||   and led the way into his office, for she accepted his salutations
U||   without lifting her head. He helped her gallantly to a chair, on which
U||   she seated herself sideways, somewhat ceremoniously, with her eyes
U||   following the point of her parasol as she traced a pattern on the
U||   carpet. A second chair offered to the mother that lady, however,
U||   declined. “I reckon to leave you and Zaidee together to talk it out,”
U||   she said; turning to her daughter, she added, “Jest you tell him all,
U||   Zaidee,” and before the Colonel could rise again, disappeared from the
U||   room. In spite of his professional experience, Starbottle was for a
U||   moment embarrassed. The young girl, however, broke the silence without
U||   looking up.
U||   “Adoniram K. Hotchkiss,” she began, in a monotonous voice, as if it
U||   were a recitation addressed to the public, “first began to take notice
U||   of me a year ago. Arter that—off and on——”
U||   “One moment,” interrupted the astounded Colonel; “do you mean Hotchkiss
U||   the President of the Ditch Company?” He had recognized the name of a
U||   prominent citizen—a rigid ascetic, taciturn, middle-aged man—a
U||   deacon—and more than that, the head of the company he had just
U||   defended. It seemed inconceivable.
U||   “That’s him,” she continued, with eyes still fixed on the parasol and
U||   without changing her monotonous tone—“off and on ever since. Most of
U||   the time at the Free-Will Baptist church—at morning service,
U||   prayer-meetings, and such. And at home—outside—er—in the road.”
U||   “Is it this gentleman—Mr. Adoniram K. Hotchkiss—who—er—promised
U||   marriage?” stammered the Colonel.
U||   “Yes.”
U||   The Colonel shifted uneasily in his chair. “Most extraordinary! for—you
U||   see—my dear young lady—this becomes—a—er—most delicate affair.”
U||   “That’s what maw said,” returned the young woman, simply, yet with the
U||   faintest smile playing around her demure lips and downcast cheek.
U||   “I mean,” said the Colonel, with a pained yet courteous smile, “that
U||   this—er—gentleman—is in fact—er—one of my clients.”
U||   “That’s what maw said, too, and of course your knowing him will make it
U||   all the easier for you,” said the young woman.
U||   A slight flush crossed the Colonel’s cheek as he returned quickly and a
U||   little stiffly, “On the contrary—er—it may make it impossible for me
U||   to—er—act in this matter.”
U||   The girl lifted her eyes. The Colonel held his breath as the long
U||   lashes were raised to his level. Even to an ordinary observer that
U||   sudden revelation of her eyes seemed to transform her face with subtle
U||   witchery. They were large, brown, and soft, yet filled with an
U||   extraordinary penetration and prescience. They were the eyes of an
U||   experienced woman of thirty fixed in the face of a child. What else the
U||   Colonel saw there Heaven only knows! He felt his inmost secrets plucked
U||   from him—his whole soul laid bare—his vanity, belligerency,
U||   gallantry—even his medieval chivalry, penetrated, and yet illuminated,
U||   in that single glance. And when the eyelids fell again, he felt that a
U||   greater part of himself had been swallowed up in them.
U||   “I beg your pardon,” he said, hurriedly. “I mean—this matter may be
U||   arranged—er—amicably. My interest with—and as you wisely
U||   say—my—er—knowledge of my client—er—Mr. Hotchkiss—may affect—a
U||   compromise.”
U||   “And damages,” said the young girl, readdressing her parasol, as if she
U||   had never looked up.
U||   The Colonel winced. “And—er—undoubtedly compensation—if you do not
U||   press a fulfilment of the promise. Unless,” he said, with an attempted
U||   return to his former easy gallantry, which, however, the recollection
U||   of her eyes made difficult, “it is a question of—er—the affections?”
U||   “Which?” said his fair client, softly.
U||   “If you still love him?” explained the Colonel, actually blushing.
U||   Zaidee again looked up; again taking the Colonel’s breath away with
U||   eyes that expressed not only the fullest perception of what he had
U||   said, but of what he thought and had not said, and with an added subtle
U||   suggestion of what he might have thought. “That’s tellin’,” she said,
U||   dropping her long lashes again. The Colonel laughed vacantly. Then
U||   feeling himself growing imbecile, he forced an equally weak gravity.
U||   “Pardon me—I understand there are no letters; may I know the way in
U||   which he formulated his declaration and promises?”
U||   “Hymn-books,” said the girl, briefly.
U||   “I beg your pardon,” said the mystified lawyer.
U||   “Hymn-books—marked words in them with pencil—and passed ’em on to me,”
U||   repeated Zaidee. “Like ‘love,’ ‘dear,’ ‘precious,’ ‘sweet,’ and
U||   ‘blessed,’” she added, accenting each word with a push of her parasol
U||   on the carpet. “Sometimes a whole line outer Tate and Brady—and
U||   Solomon’s Song, you know, and sich.”
U||   “I believe,” said the Colonel, loftily, “that the—er—phrases of sacred
U||   psalmody lend themselves to the language of the affections. But in
U||   regard to the distinct promise of marriage—was there—er—no other
U||   expression?”
U||   “Marriage Service in the prayer-book—lines and words outer that—all
U||   marked,” said Zaidee. The Colonel nodded naturally and approvingly.
U||   “Very good. Were others cognizant of this? Were there any witnesses?”
U||   “Of course not,” said the girl. “Only me and him. It was generally at
U||   church-time—or prayer-meeting. Once, in passing the plate, he slipped
U||   one o’ them peppermint lozenges with the letters stamped on it ‘I love
U||   you’ for me to take.”
U||   The Colonel coughed slightly. “And you have the lozenge?”
U||   “I ate it,” said the girl, simply.
U||   “Ah,” said the Colonel. After a pause he added, delicately: “But were
U||   these attentions—er—confined to—er—-sacred precincts? Did he meet you
U||   elsewhere?”
U||   “Useter pass our house on the road,” returned the girl, dropping into
U||   her monotonous recital, “and useter signal.”
U||   “Ah, signal?” repeated the Colonel, approvingly.
U||   “Yes! He’d say ‘Kerrow,’ and I’d say ‘Kerree.’ Suthing like a bird, you
U||   know.”
U||   Indeed, as she lifted her voice in imitation of the call the Colonel
U||   thought it certainly very sweet and birdlike. At least as she gave it.
U||   With his remembrance of the grim deacon he had doubts as to the
U||   melodiousness of his utterance. He gravely made her repeat it.
U||   “And after that signal?” he added, suggestively.
U||   “He’d pass on,” said the girl.
U||   The Colonel coughed slightly, and tapped his desk with his pen-holder.
U||   “Were there any endearments—er—caresses—er—such as taking your
U||   hand—er—clasping your waist?” he suggested, with a gallant yet
U||   respectful sweep of his white hand and bowing of his head;—“er— slight
U||   pressure of your fingers in the changes of a dance—I mean,” he
U||   corrected himself, with an apologetic cough—“in the passing of the
U||   plate?”
U||   “No;—he was not what you’d call ’fond,’” returned the girl.
U||   “Ah! Adoniram K. Hotchkiss was not ’fond’ in the ordinary acceptance of
U||   the word,” said the Colonel, with professional gravity.
U||   She lifted her disturbing eyes, and again absorbed his in her own. She
U||   also said “Yes,” although her eyes in their mysterious prescience of
U||   all he was thinking disclaimed the necessity of any answer at all. He
U||   smiled vacantly. There was a long pause. On which she slowly disengaged
U||   her parasol from the carpet pattern and stood up.
U||   “I reckon that’s about all,” she said.
U||   “Er—yes—but one moment,” said the Colonel, vaguely. He would have liked
U||   to keep her longer, but with her strange premonition of him he felt
U||   powerless to detain her, or explain his reason for doing so. He
U||   instinctively knew she had told him all; his professional judgment told
U||   him that a more hopeless case had never come to his knowledge. Yet he
U||   was not daunted, only embarrassed. “No matter,” he said, vaguely. “Of
U||   course I shall have to consult with you again.” Her eyes again answered
U||   that she expected he would, but she added, simply, “When?”
U||   “In the course of a day or two,” said the Colonel, quickly. “I will
U||   send you word.” She turned to go. In his eagerness to open the door for
U||   her he upset his chair, and with some confusion, that was actually
U||   youthful, he almost impeded her movements in the hall, and knocked his
U||   broad-brimmed Panama hat from his bowing hand in a final gallant sweep.
U||   Yet as her small, trim, youthful figure, with its simple Leghorn straw
U||   hat confined by a blue bow under her round chin, passed away before
U||   him, she looked more like a child than ever.
U||   The Colonel spent that afternoon in making diplomatic inquiries. He
U||   found his youthful client was the daughter of a widow who had a small
U||   ranch on the cross-roads, near the new Free-Will Baptist church—the
U||   evident theatre of this pastoral. They led a secluded life; the girl
U||   being little known in the town, and her beauty and fascination
U||   apparently not yet being a recognized fact. The Colonel felt a
U||   pleasurable relief at this, and a general satisfaction he could not
U||   account for. His few inquiries concerning Mr. Hotchkiss only confirmed
U||   his own impressions of the alleged lover—a serious-minded, practically
U||   abstracted man—abstentive of youthful society, and the last man
U||   apparently capable of levity of the affections or serious flirtation.
U||   The Colonel was mystified—but determined of purpose—whatever that
U||   purpose might have been.
U||   The next day he was at his office at the same hour. He was alone—as
U||   usual—the Colonel’s office really being his private lodgings, disposed
U||   in connecting rooms, a single apartment reserved for consultation. He
U||   had no clerk; his papers and briefs being taken by his faithful
U||   body-servant and ex-slave “Jim” to another firm who did his office-work
U||   since the death of Major Stryker—the Colonel’s only law partner, who
U||   fell in a duel some years previous. With a fine constancy the Colonel
U||   still retained his partner’s name on his door-plate—and, it was alleged
U||   by the superstitious, kept a certain invincibility also through the
U||   manes of that lamented and somewhat feared man.
U||   The Colonel consulted his watch, whose heavy gold case still showed the
U||   marks of a providential interference with a bullet destined for its
U||   owner, and replaced it with some difficulty and shortness of breath in
U||   his fob. At the same moment he heard a step in the passage, and the
U||   door opened to Adoniram K. Hotchkiss. The Colonel was impressed; he had
U||   a duellist’s respect for punctuality.
U||   The man entered with a nod and the expectant, inquiring look of a busy
U||   man. As his feet crossed that sacred threshold the Colonel became all
U||   courtesy; he placed a chair for his visitor, and took his hat from his
U||   half-reluctant hand. He then opened a cupboard and brought out a bottle
U||   of whiskey and two glasses.
U||   “A—er—slight refreshment, Mr. Hotchkiss,” he suggested, politely. “I
U||   never drink,” replied Hotchkiss, with the severe attitude of a total
U||   abstainer. “Ah—er—not the finest bourbon whiskey, selected by a
U||   Kentucky friend? No? Pardon me! A cigar, then—the mildest Havana.”
U||   “I do not use tobacco nor alcohol in any form,” repeated Hotchkiss,
U||   ascetically. “I have no foolish weaknesses.”
U||   The Colonel’s moist, beady eyes swept silently over his client’s sallow
U||   face. He leaned back comfortably in his chair, and half closing his
U||   eyes as in dreamy reminiscence, said, slowly: “Your reply, Mr.
U||   Hotchkiss, reminds me of—er—sing’lar circumstances that —er—occurred,
U||   in point of fact—at the St. Charles Hotel, New Orleans. Pinkey
U||   Hornblower—personal friend—invited Senator Doolittle to join him in
U||   social glass. Received, sing’larly enough, reply similar to yours.
U||   ‘Don’t drink nor smoke?’ said Pinkey. ‘Gad, sir, you must be mighty
U||   sweet on the ladies.’ Ha!” The Colonel paused long enough to allow the
U||   faint flush to pass from Hotchkiss’s cheek, and went on, half closing
U||   his eyes: “‘I allow no man, sir, to discuss my personal habits,’ said
U||   Doolittle, over his shirt collar. ‘Then I reckon shootin’ must be one
U||   of those habits,’ said Pinkey, coolly. Both men drove out on the Shell
U||   Road back of cemetery next morning. Pinkey put bullet at twelve paces
U||   through Doolittle’s temple. Poor Doo never spoke again. Left three
U||   wives and seven children, they say —two of ’em black.”
U||   “I got a note from you this morning,” said Hotchkiss, with badly
U||   concealed impatience. “I suppose in reference to our case. You have
U||   taken judgment, I believe.” The Colonel, without replying, slowly
U||   filled a glass of whiskey and water. For a moment he held it dreamily
U||   before him, as if still engaged in gentle reminiscences called up by
U||   the act. Then tossing it off, he wiped his lips with a large white
U||   handkerchief, and leaning back comfortably in his chair, said, with a
U||   wave of his hand, “The interview I requested, Mr. Hotchkiss, concerns a
U||   subject—which I may say is—er—er—at present not of a public or business
U||   nature—although later it might become—er—er—both. It is an affair of
U||   some—er—delicacy.”
U||   The Colonel paused, and Mr. Hotchkiss regarded him with increased
U||   impatience. The Colonel, however, continued, with unchanged
U||   deliberation: “It concerns—er—a young lady—a beautiful, high-souled
U||   creature, sir, who, apart from her personal loveliness— er—er—I may say
U||   is of one of the first families of Missouri, and— er—not—remotely
U||   connected by marriage with one of—er—er—my boyhood’s dearest friends.
U||   The latter, I grieve to say, was a pure invention of the Colonel’s—an
U||   oratorical addition to the scanty information he had obtained the
U||   previous day. The young lady,” he continued, blandly, “enjoys the
U||   further distinction of being the object of such attention from you as
U||   would make this interview— really—a confidential matter—er—er—among
U||   friends and—er—er— relations in present and future. I need not say that
U||   the lady I refer to is Miss Zaidee Juno Hooker, only daughter of Almira
U||   Ann Hooker, relict of Jefferson Brown Hooker, formerly of Boone County,
U||   Kentucky, and latterly of—er—Pike County, Missouri.”
U||   The sallow, ascetic hue of Mr. Hotchkiss’s face had passed through a
U||   livid and then a greenish shade, and finally settled into a sullen red.
U||   “What’s all this about?” he demanded, roughly. The least touch of
U||   belligerent fire came into Starbottle’s eye, but his bland courtesy did
U||   not change. “I believe,” he said, politely, “I have made myself clear
U||   as between—er—gentlemen, though perhaps not as clear as I should
U||   to—er—er—jury.”
U||   Mr. Hotchkiss was apparently struck with some significance in the
U||   lawyer’s reply. “I don’t know,” he said, in a lower and more cautious
U||   voice, “what you mean by what you call ‘my attentions’ to—any one—or
U||   how it concerns you. I have not exhausted half a dozen words with—the
U||   person you name—have never written her a line—nor even called at her
U||   house.” He rose with an assumption of ease, pulled down his waistcoat,
U||   buttoned his coat, and took up his hat. The Colonel did not move. “I
U||   believe I have already indicated my meaning in what I have called ‘your
U||   attentions,’” said the Colonel, blandly, “and given you my ‘concern’
U||   for speaking as—er—er mutual friend. As to your statement of your
U||   relations with Miss Hooker, I may state that it is fully corroborated
U||   by the statement of the young lady herself in this very office
U||   yesterday.”
U||   “Then what does this impertinent nonsense mean? Why am I summoned
U||   here?” said Hotchkiss, furiously.
U||   “Because,” said the Colonel, deliberately, “that statement is
U||   infamously—yes, damnably to your discredit, sir!”
U||   Mr. Hotchkiss was here seized by one of those important and
U||   inconsistent rages which occasionally betray the habitually cautious
U||   and timid man. He caught up the Colonel’s stick, which was lying on the
U||   table. At the same moment the Colonel, without any apparent effort,
U||   grasped it by the handle. To Mr. Hotchkiss’s astonishment, the stick
U||   separated in two pieces, leaving the handle and about two feet of
U||   narrow glittering steel in the Colonel’s hand. The man recoiled,
U||   dropping the useless fragment. The Colonel picked it up, fitting the
U||   shining blade in it, clicked the spring, and then rising, with a face
U||   of courtesy yet of unmistakably genuine pain, and with even a slight
U||   tremor in his voice, said, gravely:
U||   “Mr. Hotchkiss, I owe you a thousand apologies, sir, that—er— a weapon
U||   should be drawn by me—even through your own inadvertence— under the
U||   sacred protection of my roof, and upon an unarmed man. I beg your
U||   pardon, sir, and I even withdraw the expressions which provoked that
U||   inadvertence. Nor does this apology prevent you from holding me
U||   responsible—personally responsible—elsewhere for an indiscretion
U||   committed in behalf of a lady—my—er—client.”
U||   “Your client? Do you mean you have taken her case? You, the counsel for
U||   the Ditch Company?” said Mr. Hotchkiss, in trembling indignation.
U||   “Having won your case, sir,” said the Colonel, coolly, “the—er—usages
U||   of advocacy do not prevent me from espousing the cause of the weak and
U||   unprotected.”
U||   “We shall see, sir,” said Hotchkiss, grasping the handle of the door
U||   and backing into the passage. “There are other lawyers who—”
U||   “Permit me to see you out,” interrupted the Colonel, rising politely.
U||   “—will be ready to resist the attacks of blackmail,” continued
U||   Hotchkiss, retreating along the passage.
U||   “And then you will be able to repeat your remarks to me in the street,”
U||   continued the Colonel, bowing, as he persisted in following his visitor
U||   to the door.
U||   But here Mr. Hotchkiss quickly slammed it behind him, and hurried away.
U||   The Colonel returned to his office, and sitting down, took a sheet of
U||   letter paper bearing the inscription “Starbottle and Stryker, Attorneys
U||   and Counsellors,” and wrote the following lines:
U||   Hooker versus Hotchkiss.
U||   Dear Madam,—Having had a visit from the defendant in above, we should
U||   be pleased to have an interview with you at 2 P.M. to-morrow. Your
U||   obedient servants,
U||   Starbottle and Stryker.
U||   This he sealed and despatched by his trusted servant Jim, and then
U||   devoted a few moments to reflection. It was the custom of the Colonel
U||   to act first, and justify the action by reason afterwards.
U||   He knew that Hotchkiss would at once lay the matter before rival
U||   counsel. He knew that they would advise him that Miss Hooker had “no
U||   case”—that she would be nonsuited on her own evidence, and he ought not
U||   to compromise, but be ready to stand trial. He believed, however, that
U||   Hotchkiss feared that exposure, and although his own instincts had been
U||   at first against that remedy, he was now instinctively in favor of it.
U||   He remembered his own power with a jury; his vanity and his chivalry
U||   alike approved of this heroic method; he was bound by the prosaic
U||   facts—he had his own theory of the case, which no mere evidence could
U||   gainsay. In fact, Mrs. Hooker’s own words that “he was to tell the
U||   story in his own way” actually appeared to him an inspiration and a
U||   prophecy.
U||   Perhaps there was something else, due possibly to the lady’s wonderful
U||   eyes, of which he had thought much. Yet it was not her simplicity that
U||   affected him solely; on the contrary, it was her apparent intelligent
U||   reading of the character of her recreant lover—and of his own! Of all
U||   the Colonel’s previous “light” or “serious” loves none had ever before
U||   flattered him in that way. And it was this, combined with the respect
U||   which he had held for their professional relations, that precluded his
U||   having a more familiar knowledge of his client, through serious
U||   questioning, or playful gallantry. I am not sure it was not part of the
U||   charm to have a rustic femme incomprise as a client.
U||   Nothing could exceed the respect with which he greeted her as she
U||   entered his office the next day. He even affected not to notice that
U||   she had put on her best clothes, and he made no doubt appeared as when
U||   she had first attracted the mature yet faithless attentions of Deacon
U||   Hotchkiss at church. A white virginal muslin was belted around her slim
U||   figure by a blue ribbon, and her Leghorn hat was drawn around her oval
U||   cheek by a bow of the same color. She had a Southern girl’s narrow
U||   feet, encased in white stockings and kid slippers, which were crossed
U||   primly before her as she sat in a chair, supporting her arm by her
U||   faithful parasol planted firmly on the floor. A faint odor of
U||   southernwood exhaled from her, and, oddly enough, stirred the Colonel
U||   with a far-off recollection of a pine-shaded Sunday school on a Georgia
U||   hillside and of his first love, aged ten, in a short, starched frock.
U||   Possibly it was the same recollection that revived something of the
U||   awkwardness he had felt then.
U||   He, however, smiled vaguely and, sitting down, coughed slightly, and
U||   placed his fingertips together. “I have had an—er—interview with Mr.
U||   Hotchkiss, but—I—er—regret to say there seems to be no prospect
U||   of—er—compromise.” He paused, and to his surprise her listless
U||   “company” face lit up with an adorable smile. “Of course!—ketch him!”
U||   she said. “Was he mad when you told him?” She put her knees comfortably
U||   together and leaned forward for a reply.
U||   For all that, wild horses could not have torn from the Colonel a word
U||   about Hotchkiss’s anger. “He expressed his intention of employing
U||   counsel—and defending a suit,” returned the Colonel, affably basking in
U||   her smile. She dragged her chair nearer his desk. “Then you’ll fight
U||   him tooth and nail?” she said eagerly; “you’ll show him up? You’ll tell
U||   the whole story your own way? You’ll give him fits?—and you’ll make him
U||   pay? Sure?” she went on, breathlessly.
U||   “I—er—will,” said the Colonel, almost as breathlessly.
U||   She caught his fat white hand, which was lying on the table, between
U||   her own and lifted it to her lips. He felt her soft young fingers even
U||   through the lisle-thread gloves that encased them and the warm moisture
U||   of her lips upon his skin. He felt himself flushing—but was unable to
U||   break the silence or change his position. The next moment she had
U||   scuttled back with her chair to her old position.
U||   “I—er—certainly shall do my best,” stammered the Colonel, in an attempt
U||   to recover his dignity and composure.
U||   “That’s enough! You’ll do it,” said the girl, enthusiastically. “Lordy!
U||   Just you talk for me as ye did for his old Ditch Company, and you’ll
U||   fetch it—every time! Why, when you made that jury sit up the other
U||   day—when you got that off about the Merrikan flag waving equally over
U||   the rights of honest citizens banded together in peaceful commercial
U||   pursuits, as well as over the fortress of official proflig—”
U||   “Oligarchy,” murmured the Colonel, courteously.
U||   “Oligarchy,” repeated the girl, quickly, “my breath was just took away.
U||   I said to maw, ‘Ain’t he too sweet for anything!’ I did, honest Injin!
U||   And when you rolled it all off at the end—never missing a word—(you
U||   didn’t need to mark ’em in a lesson-book, but had ’em all ready on your
U||   tongue), and walked out—Well! I didn’t know you nor the Ditch Company
U||   from Adam, but I could have just run over and kissed you there before
U||   the whole court!”
U||   She laughed, with her face glowing, although her strange eyes were cast
U||   down. Alack! the Colonel’s face was equally flushed, and his own beady
U||   eyes were on his desk. To any other woman he would have voiced the
U||   banal gallantry that he should now, himself, look forward to that
U||   reward, but the words never reached his lips. He laughed, coughed
U||   slightly, and when he looked up again she had fallen into the same
U||   attitude as on her first visit, with her parasol point on the floor.
U||   “I must ask you to—er—direct your memory—to—er—another point; the
U||   breaking off of the—er—er—er—engagement. Did he—er—give any reason for
U||   it? Or show any cause?”
U||   “No; he never said anything,” returned the girl.
U||   “Not in his usual way?—er—no reproaches out of the hymn-book?—or the
U||   sacred writings?”
U||   “No; he just quit.”
U||   “Er—ceased his attentions,” said the Colonel, gravely. “And naturally
U||   you—er—were not conscious of any cause for his doing so.” The girl
U||   raised her wonderful eyes so suddenly and so penetratingly without
U||   reply in any other way that the Colonel could only hurriedly say: “I
U||   see! None, of course!”
U||   At which she rose, the Colonel rising also. “We—shall begin proceedings
U||   at once. I must, however, caution you to answer no questions nor say
U||   anything about this case to any one until you are in court.”
U||   She answered his request with another intelligent look and a nod. He
U||   accompanied her to the door. As he took her proffered hand he raised
U||   the lisle-thread fingers to his lips with old-fashioned gallantry. As
U||   if that act had condoned for his first omissions and awkwardness, he
U||   became his old-fashioned self again, buttoned his coat, pulled out his
U||   shirt frill, and strutted back to his desk.
U||   A day or two later it was known throughout the town that Zaidee Hooker
U||   had sued Adoniram Hotchkiss for breach of promise, and that the damages
U||   were laid at five thousand dollars. As in those bucolic days the
U||   Western press was under the secure censorship of a revolver, a cautious
U||   tone of criticism prevailed, and any gossip was confined to personal
U||   expression, and even then at the risk of the gossiper. Nevertheless,
U||   the situation provoked the intensest curiosity. The Colonel was
U||   approached—until his statement that he should consider any attempt to
U||   overcome his professional secrecy a personal reflection withheld
U||   further advances. The community were left to the more ostentatious
U||   information of the defendant’s counsel, Messrs. Kitcham and Bilser,
U||   that the case was “ridiculous” and “rotten,” that the plaintiff would
U||   be nonsuited, and the fire-eating Starbottle would be taught a lesson
U||   that he could not “bully” the law—and there were some dark hints of a
U||   conspiracy. It was even hinted that the “case” was the revengeful and
U||   preposterous outcome of the refusal of Hotchkiss to pay Starbottle an
U||   extravagant fee for his late services to the Ditch Company. It is
U||   unnecessary to say that these words were not reported to the Colonel.
U||   It was, however, an unfortunate circumstance for the calmer, ethical
U||   consideration of the subject that the church sided with Hotchkiss, as
U||   this provoked an equal adherence to the plaintiff and Starbottle on the
U||   part of the larger body of non-church-goers, who were delighted at a
U||   possible exposure of the weakness of religious rectitude. “I’ve allus
U||   had my suspicions o’ them early candle-light meetings down at that
U||   gospel shop,” said one critic, “and I reckon Deacon Hotchkiss didn’t
U||   rope in the gals to attend jest for psalm-singing.” “Then for him to
U||   get up and leave the board afore the game’s finished and try to sneak
U||   out of it,” said another. “I suppose that’s what they call religious.”
U||   It was therefore not remarkable that the courthouse three weeks later
U||   was crowded with an excited multitude of the curious and sympathizing.
U||   The fair plaintiff, with her mother, was early in attendance, and under
U||   the Colonel’s advice appeared in the same modest garb in which she had
U||   first visited his office. This and her downcast modest demeanor were
U||   perhaps at first disappointing to the crowd, who had evidently expected
U||   a paragon of loveliness—as the Circe of the grim ascetic defendant, who
U||   sat beside his counsel. But presently all eyes were fixed on the
U||   Colonel, who certainly made up in his appearance any deficiency of his
U||   fair client. His portly figure was clothed in a blue dress-coat with
U||   brass buttons, a buff waistcoat which permitted his frilled shirt front
U||   to become erectile above it, a black satin stock which confined a
U||   boyish turned-down collar around his full neck, and immaculate drill
U||   trousers, strapped over varnished boots. A murmur ran round the court.
U||   “Old ‘Personally Responsible’ had got his war-paint on,” “The Old
U||   War-Horse is smelling powder,” were whispered comments. Yet for all
U||   that the most irreverent among them recognized vaguely, in this bizarre
U||   figure, something of an honored past in their country’s history, and
U||   possibly felt the spell of old deeds and old names that had once
U||   thrilled their boyish pulses. The new District Judge returned Colonel
U||   Starbottle’s profoundly punctilious bow. The Colonel was followed by
U||   his negro servant, carrying a parcel of hymn-books and Bibles, who,
U||   with a courtesy evidently imitated from his master, placed one before
U||   the opposite counsel. This, after a first curious glance, the lawyer
U||   somewhat superciliously tossed aside. But when Jim, proceeding to the
U||   jury-box, placed with equal politeness the remaining copies before the
U||   jury, the opposite counsel sprang to his feet.
U||   “I want to direct the attention of the Court to this unprecedented
U||   tampering with the jury, by this gratuitous exhibition of matter
U||   impertinent and irrelevant to the issue.”
U||   The Judge cast an inquiring look at Colonel Starbottle.
U||   “May it please the Court,” returned Colonel Starbottle with dignity,
U||   ignoring the counsel, “the defendant’s counsel will observe that he is
U||   already furnished with the matter—which I regret to say he has
U||   treated—in the presence of the Court—and of his client, a deacon of the
U||   church—with—er—-great superciliousness. When I state to your Honor that
U||   the books in question are hymn-books and copies of the Holy Scriptures,
U||   and that they are for the instruction of the jury, to whom I shall have
U||   to refer them in the course of my opening, I believe I am within my
U||   rights.”
U||   “The act is certainly unprecedented,” said the Judge, dryly, “but
U||   unless the counsel for the plaintiff expects the jury to sing from
U||   these hymn-books, their introduction is not improper, and I cannot
U||   admit the objection. As defendant’s counsel are furnished with copies
U||   also, they cannot plead ‘surprise,’ as in the introduction of new
U||   matter, and as plaintiff’s counsel relies evidently upon the jury’s
U||   attention to his opening, he would not be the first person to distract
U||   it.” After a pause he added, addressing the Colonel, who remained
U||   standing, “The Court is with you, sir; proceed.”
U||   But the Colonel remained motionless and statuesque, with folded arms.
U||   “I have overruled the objection,” repeated the Judge; “you may go on.”
U||   “I am waiting, your Honor, for the—er—withdrawal by the defendant’s
U||   counsel of the word ‘tampering,’ as refers to myself, and of
U||   ‘impertinent,’ as refers to the sacred volumes.”
U||   “The request is a proper one, and I have no doubt will be acceded to,”
U||   returned the Judge, quietly. The defendant’s counsel rose and mumbled a
U||   few words of apology, and the incident closed. There was, however, a
U||   general feeling that the Colonel had in some way “scored,” and if his
U||   object had been to excite the greatest curiosity about the books, he
U||   had made his point.
U||   But impassive of his victory, he inflated his chest, with his right
U||   hand in the breast of his buttoned coat, and began. His usual high
U||   color had paled slightly, but the small pupils of his prominent eyes
U||   glittered like steel. The young girl leaned forward in her chair with
U||   an attention so breathless, a sympathy so quick, and an admiration so
U||   artless and unconscious that in an instant she divided with the speaker
U||   the attention of the whole assemblage. It was very hot; the court was
U||   crowded to suffocation; even the open windows revealed a crowd of faces
U||   outside the building, eagerly following the Colonel’s words.
U||   He would remind the jury that only a few weeks ago he stood there as
U||   the advocate of a powerful company, then represented by the present
U||   defendant. He spoke then as the champion of strict justice against
U||   legal oppression; no less should he to-day champion the cause of the
U||   unprotected and the comparatively defenseless—save for that paramount
U||   power which surrounds beauty and innocence—even though the plaintiff of
U||   yesterday was the defendant of to-day. As he approached the court a
U||   moment ago he had raised his eyes and beheld the starry flag flying
U||   from its dome—and he knew that glorious banner was a symbol of the
U||   perfect equality, under the Constitution, of the rich and the poor, the
U||   strong and the weak—an equality which made the simple citizen taken
U||   from the plough in the veld, the pick in the gulch, or from behind the
U||   counter in the mining town, who served on that jury, the equal arbiters
U||   of justice with that highest legal luminary whom they were proud to
U||   welcome on the bench to-day. The Colonel paused, with a stately bow to
U||   the impassive Judge. It was this, he continued, which lifted his heart
U||   as he approached the building. And yet—he had entered it with an
U||   uncertain—he might almost say—a timid step. And why? He knew,
U||   gentlemen, he was about to confront a profound—aye! a sacred
U||   responsibility! Those hymn-books and holy writings handed to the jury
U||   were not, as his Honor surmised, for the purpose of enabling the jury
U||   to indulge in—er—preliminary choral exercise! He might, indeed, say
U||   “alas not!” They were the damning, incontrovertible proofs of the
U||   perfidy of the defendant. And they would prove as terrible a warning to
U||   him as the fatal characters upon Belshazzar’s wall. There was a strong
U||   sensation. Hotchkiss turned a sallow green. His lawyers assumed a
U||   careless smile.
U||   It was his duty to tell them that this was not one of those ordinary
U||   “breach-of-promise” cases which were too often the occasion of ruthless
U||   mirth and indecent levity in the courtroom. The jury would find nothing
U||   of that here, There were no love-letters with the epithets of
U||   endearment, nor those mystic crosses and ciphers which, he had been
U||   credibly informed, chastely hid the exchange of those mutual caresses
U||   known as “kisses.” There was no cruel tearing of the veil from those
U||   sacred privacies of the human affection—there was no forensic shouting
U||   out of those fond confidences meant only for one. But there was, he was
U||   shocked to say, a new sacrilegious intrusion. The weak pipings of Cupid
U||   were mingled with the chorus of the saints—the sanctity of the temple
U||   known as the “meeting-house” was desecrated by proceedings more in
U||   keeping with the shrine of Venus—and the inspired writings themselves
U||   were used as the medium of amatory and wanton flirtation by the
U||   defendant in his sacred capacity as Deacon.
U||   The Colonel artistically paused after this thunderous denunciation. The
U||   jury turned eagerly to the leaves of the hymn-books, but the larger
U||   gaze of the audience remained fixed upon the speaker and the girl, who
U||   sat in rapt admiration of his periods. After the hush, the Colonel
U||   continued in a lower and sadder voice: “There are, perhaps, few of us
U||   here, gentlemen—with the exception of the defendant—who can arrogate to
U||   themselves the title of regular churchgoers, or to whom these humbler
U||   functions of the prayer-meeting, the Sunday-school, and the Bible class
U||   are habitually familiar. Yet”—more solemnly—“down in your hearts is the
U||   deep conviction of our short-comings and failings, and a laudable
U||   desire that others at least should profit by the teachings we neglect.
U||   Perhaps,” he continued, closing his eyes dreamily, “there is not a man
U||   here who does not recall the happy days of his boyhood, the rustic
U||   village spire, the lessons shared with some artless village maiden,
U||   with whom he later sauntered, hand in hand, through the woods, as the
U||   simple rhyme rose upon their lips,
U||   Always make it a point to have it a rule
U||   Never to be late at the Sabbath-school.
U||   He would recall the strawberry feasts, the welcome annual picnic,
U||   redolent with hunks of gingerbread and sarsaparilla. How would they
U||   feel to know that these sacred recollections were now forever profaned
U||   in their memory by the knowledge that the defendant was capable of
U||   using such occasions to make love to the larger girls and teachers,
U||   whilst his artless companions were innocently—the Court will pardon me
U||   for introducing what I am credibly informed is the local expression
U||   ‘doing gooseberry’?” The tremulous flicker of a smile passed over the
U||   faces of the listening crowd, and the Colonel slightly winced. But he
U||   recovered himself instantly, and continued:
U||   “My client, the only daughter of a widowed mother—who has for years
U||   stemmed the varying tides of adversity—in the western precincts of this
U||   town—stands before you to-day invested only in her own innocence. She
U||   wears no—er—rich gifts of her faithless admirer—is panoplied in no
U||   jewels, rings, nor mementoes of affection such as lovers delight to
U||   hang upon the shrine of their affections; hers is not the glory with
U||   which Solomon decorated the Queen of Sheba, though the defendant, as I
U||   shall show later, clothed her in the less expensive flowers of the
U||   king’s poetry. No! gentlemen! The defendant exhibited in this affair a
U||   certain frugality of—er—pecuniary investment, which I am willing to
U||   admit may be commendable in his class. His only gift was characteristic
U||   alike of his methods and his economy. There is, I understand, a certain
U||   not unimportant feature of religious exercise known as ‘taking a
U||   collection.’ The defendant, on this occasion, by the mute presentation
U||   of a tip plate covered with baize, solicited the pecuniary
U||   contributions of the faithful. On approaching the plaintiff, however,
U||   he himself slipped a love-token upon the plate and pushed it towards
U||   her. That love-token was a lozenge—a small disk, I have reason to
U||   believe, concocted of peppermint and sugar, bearing upon its reverse
U||   surface the simple words, ‘I love you!’ I have since ascertained that
U||   these disks may be bought for five cents a dozen—or at considerably
U||   less than one half-cent for the single lozenge. Yes, gentlemen, the
U||   words ‘I love you!‘—the oldest legend of all; the refrain, ‘when the
U||   morning stars sang together’—were presented to the plaintiff by a
U||   medium so insignificant that there is, happily, no coin in the republic
U||   low enough to represent its value.
U||   “I shall prove to you, gentlemen of the jury,” said the Colonel,
U||   solemnly, drawing a Bible from his coat-tail pocket, “that the
U||   defendant, for the last twelve months, conducted an amatory
U||   correspondence with the plaintiff by means of underlined words of
U||   sacred writ and church psalmody, such as ‘beloved,’ ‘precious,’ and
U||   ‘dearest,’ occasionally appropriating whole passages which seemed
U||   apposite to his tender passion. I shall call your attention to one of
U||   them. The defendant, while professing to be a total abstainer—a man
U||   who, in my own knowledge, has refused spirituous refreshment as an
U||   inordinate weakness of the flesh, with shameless hypocrisy underscores
U||   with his pencil the following passage and presents it to the plaintiff.
U||   The gentlemen of the jury will find it in the Song of Solomon, page
U||   548, chapter II, verse 5.” After a pause, in which the rapid rustling
U||   of leaves was heard in the jury-box, Colonel Starbottle declaimed in a
U||   pleading, stentorian voice, “‘Stay me with —er—flagons, comfort me
U||   with—er—apples—for I am—er—sick of love.’ Yes, gentlemen!—yes, you may
U||   well turn from those accusing pages and look at the double-faced
U||   defendant. He desires—to—er—be —‘stayed with flagons’! I am not aware,
U||   at present, what kind of liquor is habitually dispensed at these
U||   meetings, and for which the defendant so urgently clamored; but it will
U||   be my duty before this trial is over to discover it, if I have to
U||   summon every barkeeper in this district. For the moment, I will simply
U||   call your attention to the quantity. It is not a single drink that the
U||   defendant asks for—not a glass of light and generous wine, to be shared
U||   with his inamorata—but a number of flagons or vessels, each possibly
U||   holding a pint measure—for himself!”
U||   The smile of the audience had become a laugh. The Judge looked up
U||   warningly, when his eye caught the fact that the Colonel had again
U||   winced at this mirth. He regarded him seriously. Mr. Hotchkiss’s
U||   counsel had joined in the laugh affectedly, but Hotchkiss himself was
U||   ashy pale. There was also a commotion in the jury-box, a hurried
U||   turning over of leaves, and an excited discussion.
U||   “The gentlemen of the jury,” said the Judge, with official gravity,
U||   “will please keep order and attend only to the speeches of counsel. Any
U||   discussion here is irregular and premature—and must be reserved for the
U||   jury-room—after they have retired.”
U||   The foreman of the jury struggled to his feet. He was a powerful man,
U||   with a good-humored face, and, in spite of his unfelicitous nickname of
U||   “The Bone-Breaker,” had a kindly, simple, but somewhat emotional
U||   nature. Nevertheless, it appeared as if he were laboring under some
U||   powerful indignation.
U||   “Can we ask a question, Judge?” he said, respectfully, although his
U||   voice had the unmistakable Western-American ring in it, as of one who
U||   was unconscious that he could be addressing any but his peers.
U||   “Yes,” said the Judge, good-humoredly.
U||   “We’re finding in this yere piece, out of which the Kernel hes just bin
U||   a-quotin’, some language that me and my pardners allow hadn’t orter to
U||   be read out afore a young lady in court—and we want to know of you—ez a
U||   fair-minded and impartial man—ef this is the reg’lar kind o’ book given
U||   to gals and babies down at the meetin’-house.”
U||   “The jury will please follow the counsel’s speech, without comment,”
U||   said the Judge, briefly, fully aware that the defendant’s counsel would
U||   spring to his feet, as he did promptly. “The Court will allow us to
U||   explain to the gentlemen that the language they seem to object to has
U||   been accepted by the best theologians for the last thousand years as
U||   being purely mystic. As I will explain later, those are merely symbols
U||   of the Church—”
U||   “Of wot?” interrupted the foreman, in deep scorn.
U||   “Of the Church!”
U||   “We ain’t askin’ any questions o’ you—and we ain’t takin’ any answers,”
U||   said the foreman, sitting down promptly.
U||   “I must insist,” said the Judge, sternly, “that the plaintiff’s counsel
U||   be allowed to continue his opening without interruption. You” (to
U||   defendant’s counsel) “will have your opportunity to reply later.”
U||   The counsel sank down in his seat with the bitter conviction that the
U||   jury was manifestly against him, and the case as good as lost. But his
U||   face was scarcely as disturbed as his client’s, who, in great
U||   agitation, had begun to argue with him wildly, and was apparently
U||   pressing some point against the lawyer’s vehement opposal. The
U||   Colonel’s murky eyes brightened as he still stood erect with his hand
U||   thrust in his breast.
U||   “It will be put to you, gentlemen, when the counsel on the other side
U||   refrains from mere interruption and confines himself to reply, that my
U||   unfortunate client has no action—no remedy at law—because there were no
U||   spoken words of endearment. But, gentlemen, it will depend upon you to
U||   say what are and what are not articulate expressions of love. We all
U||   know that among the lower animals, with whom you may possibly be called
U||   upon to classify the defendant, there are certain signals more or less
U||   harmonious, as the case may be. The ass brays, the horse neighs, the
U||   sheep bleats—the feathered denizens of the grove call to their mates in
U||   more musical roundelays. These are recognized facts, gentlemen, which
U||   you yourselves, as dwellers among nature in this beautiful land, are
U||   all cognizant of. They are facts that no one would deny—and we should
U||   have a poor opinion of the ass who, at—er—such a supreme moment, would
U||   attempt to suggest that his call was unthinking and without
U||   significance. But, gentlemen, I shall prove to you that such was the
U||   foolish, self-convicting custom of the defendant. With the greatest
U||   reluctance, and the—er—greatest pain, I succeeded in wresting from the
U||   maidenly modesty of my fair client the innocent confession that the
U||   defendant had induced her to correspond with him in these methods.
U||   Picture to yourself, gentlemen, the lonely moonlight road beside the
U||   widow’s humble cottage. It is a beautiful night, sanctified to the
U||   affections, and the innocent girl is leaning from her casement.
U||   Presently there appears upon the road a slinking, stealthy figure—the
U||   defendant, on his way to church. True to the instruction she has
U||   received from him, her lips part in the musical utterance” (the Colonel
U||   lowered his voice in a faint falsetto, presumably in fond imitation of
U||   his fair client),“‘Kerree!’ Instantly the night became resonant with
U||   the impassioned reply” (the Colonel here lifted his voice in stentorian
U||   tones), “‘Kerrow.’ Again, as he passes, rises the soft ‘Kerree’; again,
U||   as his form is lost in the distance, comes back the deep ‘Kerrow.’”
U||   A burst of laughter, long, loud, and irrepressible, struck the whole
U||   courtroom, and before the Judge could lift his half-composed face and
U||   take his handkerchief from his mouth, a faint “Kerree” from some
U||   unrecognized obscurity of the courtroom was followed by a loud “Kerrow”
U||   from some opposite locality. “The sheriff will clear the court,” said
U||   the Judge, sternly; but alas, as the embarrassed and choking officials
U||   rushed hither and thither, a soft “Kerree” from the spectators at the
U||   window, outside the courthouse, was answered by a loud chorus of
U||   “Kerrows” from the opposite windows, filled with onlookers. Again the
U||   laughter arose everywhere—even the fair plaintiff herself sat convulsed
U||   behind her handkerchief.
U||   The figure of Colonel Starbottle alone remained erect—white and rigid.
U||   And then the Judge, looking up, saw what no one else in the court had
U||   seen—that the Colonel was sincere and in earnest; that what he had
U||   conceived to be the pleader’s most perfect acting, and most elaborate
U||   irony, were the deep, serious, mirthless convictions of a man without
U||   the least sense of humor. There was a touch of this respect in the
U||   Judge’s voice as he said to him, gently, “You may proceed, Colonel
U||   Starbottle.”
U||   “I thank your Honor,” said the Colonel, slowly, “for recognizing and
U||   doing all in your power to prevent an interruption that, during my
U||   thirty years’ experience at the bar, I have never yet been subjected to
U||   without the privilege of holding the instigators thereof
U||   responsible—personally responsible. It is possibly my fault that I have
U||   failed, oratorically, to convey to the gentlemen of the jury the full
U||   force and significance of the defendant’s signals. I am aware that my
U||   voice is singularly deficient in producing either the dulcet tones of
U||   my fair client or the impassioned vehemence of the defendant’s repose.
U||   I will,” continued the Colonel, with a fatigued but blind fatuity that
U||   ignored the hurriedly knit brows and warning eyes of the Judge, “try
U||   again. The note uttered by my client” (lowering his voice to the
U||   faintest of falsettos) “was ‘Kerree’; the response was ‘Kerrow’”—and
U||   the Colonel’s voice fairly shook the dome above him.
U||   Another uproar of laughter followed this apparently audacious
U||   repetition, but was interrupted by an unlooked-for incident. The
U||   defendant rose abruptly, and tearing himself away from the withholding
U||   hand and pleading protestations of his counsel, absolutely fled from
U||   the courtroom, his appearance outside being recognized by a prolonged
U||   “Kerrow” from the bystanders, which again and again followed him in the
U||   distance. In the momentary silence which followed, the Colonel’s voice
U||   was heard saying, “We rest here, your Honor,” and he sat down. No less
U||   white, but more agitated, was the face of the defendant’s counsel, who
U||   instantly rose.
U||   “For some unexplained reason, your Honor, my client desires to suspend
U||   further proceedings, with a view to effect a peaceable compromise with
U||   the plaintiff. As he is a man of wealth and position, he is able and
U||   willing to pay liberally for that privilege. While I, as his counsel,
U||   am still convinced of his legal irresponsibility, as he has chosen,
U||   however, to publicly abandon his rights here, I can only ask your
U||   Honor’s permission to suspend further proceedings until I can confer
U||   with Colonel Starbottle.”
U||   “As far as I can follow the pleadings,” said the Judge, gravely, “the
U||   case seems to be hardly one for litigation, and I approve of the
U||   defendant’s course, while I strongly urge the plaintiff to accept it.”
U||   Colonel Starbottle bent over his fair client. Presently he rose,
U||   unchanged in look or demeanor. “I yield, your Honor, to the wishes of
U||   my client, and—er—lady. We accept.”
U||   Before the court adjourned that day it was known throughout the town
U||   that Adoniram K. Hotchkiss had compromised the suit for four thousand
U||   dollars and costs.
U||   Colonel Starbottle had so far recovered his equanimity as to strut
U||   jauntily towards his office, where he was to meet his fair client. He
U||   was surprised, however, to find her already there, and in company with
U||   a somewhat sheepish-looking young man—a stranger. If the Colonel had
U||   any disappointment in meeting a third party to the interview, his
U||   old-fashioned courtesy did not permit him to show it. He bowed
U||   graciously, and politely motioned them each to a seat.
U||   “I reckoned I’d bring Hiram round with me,” said the young lady,
U||   lifting her searching eyes, after a pause, to the Colonel’s, “though he
U||   was awful shy, and allowed that you didn’t know him from Adam—or even
U||   suspected his existence. But I said, ‘That’s just where you slip up,
U||   Hiram; a pow’ful man like the Colonel knows everything—and I’ve seen it
U||   in his eye.’ Lordy!” she continued, with a laugh, leaning forward over
U||   her parasol, as her eyes again sought the Colonel’s, “don’t you
U||   remember when you asked me if I loved that old Hotchkiss, and I told
U||   you ‘That’s tellin’,’ and you looked at me, Lordy! I knew then you
U||   suspected there was a Hiram somewhere—as good as if I’d told you. Now,
U||   you, jest get up, Hiram, and give the Colonel a good handshake. For if
U||   it wasn’t for him and his searchin’ ways, and his awful power of
U||   language, I wouldn’t hev got that four thousand dollars out o’ that
U||   flirty fool Hotchkiss—enough to buy a farm, so as you and me could get
U||   married! That’s what you owe to him. Don’t stand there like a stuck
U||   fool starin’ at him. He won’t eat you—though he’s killed many a better
U||   man. Come, have I got to do all the kissin’!”
U||   It is of record that the Colonel bowed so courteously and so profoundly
U||   that he managed not merely to evade the proffered hand of the shy
U||   Hiram, but to only lightly touch the franker and more impulsive
U||   fingertips of the gentle Zaidee. “I—er—offer my sincerest
U||   congratulations—though I think you—er—overestimate—my—er—powers of
U||   penetration. Unfortunately, a pressing engagement, which may oblige me
U||   also to leave town to-night, forbids my saying more. I have—er—left
U||   the—er—business settlement of this—er—case in the hands of the lawyers
U||   who do my office-work, and who will show you every attention. And now
U||   let me wish you a very good afternoon.”
U||   Nevertheless, the Colonel returned to his private room, and it was
U||   nearly twilight when the faithful Jim entered, to find him sitting
U||   meditatively before his desk. “‘Fo’ God! Kernel—I hope dey ain’t nuffin
U||   de matter, but you’s lookin’ mightly solemn! I ain’t seen you look dat
U||   way, Kernel, since de day pooh Marse Stryker was fetched home shot froo
U||   de head.”
U||   “Hand me down the whiskey, Jim,” said the Colonel, rising slowly.
U||   The negro flew to the closet joyfully, and brought out the bottle. The
U||   Colonel poured out a glass of the spirit and drank it with his old
U||   deliberation.
U||   “You’re quite right, Jim,” he said, putting down his glass, “but
U||   I’m—er—getting old—and—somehow—I am missing poor Stryker damnably!”

U||THE DUPLICITY OF HARGRAVES[67][24]
U||   By O. Henry (1862–1910)
U||   When Major Pendleton Talbot, of Mobile, sir, and his daughter, Miss
U||   Lydia Talbot, came to Washington to reside, they selected for a
U||   boarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of the
U||   quietest avenues. It was an old-fashioned brick building, with a
U||   portico upheld by tall white pillars. The yard was shaded by stately
U||   locusts and elms, and a catalpa tree in season rained its pink and
U||   white blossoms upon the grass. Rows of high box bushes lined the fence
U||   and walks. It was the Southern style and aspect of the place that
U||   pleased the eyes of the Talbots.
U||   In this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms, including a
U||   study for Major Talbot, who was adding the finishing chapters to his
U||   book, Anecdotes and Reminiscences of the Alabama Army, Bench, and Bar.
U||   Major Talbot was of the old, old South. The present day had little
U||   interest or excellence in his eyes. His mind lived in that period
U||   before the Civil War when the Talbots owned thousands of acres of fine
U||   cotton land and the slaves to till them; when the family mansion was
U||   the scene of princely hospitality, and drew its guests from the
U||   aristocracy of the South. Out of that period he had brought all its old
U||   pride and scruples of honor, an antiquated and punctilious politeness,
U||   and (you would think) its wardrobe.
U||   Such clothes were surely never made within fifty years. The Major was
U||   tall, but whenever he made that wonderful, archaic genuflexion he
U||   called a bow, the corners of his frock coat swept the floor. That
U||   garment was a surprise even to Washington, which has long ago ceased to
U||   shy at the frocks and broad-brimmed hats of Southern Congressmen. One
U||   of the boarders christened it a “Father Hubbard,” and it certainly was
U||   high in the waist and full in the skirt.
U||   But the Major, with all his queer clothes, his immense area of plaited,
U||   raveling shirt bosom, and the little black string tie with the bow
U||   always slipping on one side, both was smiled at and liked in Mrs.
U||   Vardeman’s select boarding house. Some of the young department clerks
U||   would often “string him,” as they called it, getting him started upon
U||   the subject dearest to him—the traditions and history of his beloved
U||   Southland. During his talks he would quote freely from the Anecdotes
U||   and Reminiscences. But they were very careful not to let him see their
U||   designs, for in spite of his sixty-eight years he could make the
U||   boldest of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his piercing
U||   gray eyes.
U||   Miss Lydia was a plump, little old maid of thirty-five, with smoothly
U||   drawn, tightly twisted hair that made her look still older.
U||   Old-fashioned, too, she was; but antebellum glory did not radiate from
U||   her as it did from the Major. She possessed a thrifty common sense, and
U||   it was she who handled the finances of the family, and met all comers
U||   when there were bills to pay. The Major regarded board bills and wash
U||   bills as contemptible nuisances. They kept coming in so persistently
U||   and so often. Why, the Major wanted to know, could they not be filed
U||   and paid in a lump sum at some convenient period—say when the Anecdotes
U||   and Reminiscences had been published and paid for? Miss Lydia would
U||   calmly go on with her sewing and say, “We’ll pay as we go as long as
U||   the money lasts, and then perhaps they’ll have to lump it.”
U||   Most of Mrs. Vardeman’s boarders were away during the day, being nearly
U||   all department clerks and business men; but there was one of them who
U||   was about the house a great deal from morning to night. This was a
U||   young man named Henry Hopkins Hargraves—every one in the house
U||   addressed him by his full name—who was engaged at one of the popular
U||   vaudeville theaters. Vaudeville has risen to such a respectable plane
U||   in the last few years, and Mr. Hargraves was such a modest and
U||   well-mannered person, that Mrs. Vardeman could find no objection to
U||   enrolling him upon her list of boarders.
U||   At the theater Hargraves was known as an all-round dialect comedian,
U||   having a large repertoire of German, Irish, Swede, and black-face
U||   specialties. But Mr. Hargraves was ambitious, and often spoke of his
U||   great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy.
U||   This young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for Major Talbot.
U||   Whenever that gentleman would begin his Southern reminiscences, or
U||   repeat some of the liveliest of the anecdotes, Hargraves could always
U||   be found, the most attentive among his listeners.
U||   For a time the Major showed an inclination to discourage the advances
U||   of the “play actor,” as he privately termed him; but soon the young
U||   man’s agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of the old
U||   gentleman’s stories completely won him over.
U||   It was not long before the two were like old chums. The Major set apart
U||   each afternoon to read to him the manuscript of his book. During the
U||   anecdotes Hargraves never failed to laugh at exactly the right point.
U||   The Major was moved to declare to Miss Lydia one day that young
U||   Hargraves possessed remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for
U||   the old régime. And when it came to talking of those old days—if Major
U||   Talbot liked to talk, Mr. Hargraves was entranced to listen.
U||   Like almost all old people who talk of the past, the Major loved to
U||   linger over details. In describing the splendid, almost royal, days of
U||   the old planters, he would hesitate until he had recalled the name of
U||   the negro who held his horse, or the exact date of certain minor
U||   happenings, or the number of bales of cotton raised in such a year; but
U||   Hargraves never grew impatient or lost interest. On the contrary, he
U||   would advance questions on a variety of subjects connected with the
U||   life of that time, and he never failed to extract ready replies.
U||   The fox hunts, the ’possum suppers, the hoe-downs and jubilees in the
U||   negro quarters, the banquets in the plantation-house hall, when
U||   invitations went for fifty miles around; the occasional feuds with the
U||   neighboring gentry; the Major’s duel with Rathbone Culbertson about
U||   Kitty Chalmers, who afterward married a Thwaite of South Carolina; and
U||   private yacht races for fabulous sums on Mobile Bay; the quaint
U||   beliefs, improvident habits, and loyal virtues of the old slaves—all
U||   these were subjects that held both the Major and Hargraves absorbed for
U||   hours at a time.
U||   Sometimes, at night, when the young man would be coming upstairs to his
U||   room after his turn at the theater was over, the Major would appear at
U||   the door of his study and beckon archly to him. Going in, Hargraves
U||   would find a little table set with a decanter, sugar bowl, fruit, and a
U||   big bunch of fresh green mint.
U||   “It occurred to me,” the Major would begin—he was always
U||   ceremonious—“that perhaps you might have found your duties at the—at
U||   your place of occupation—sufficiently arduous to enable you, Mr.
U||   Hargraves, to appreciate what the poet might well have had in his mind
U||   when he wrote, ‘tired Nature’s sweet restorer’—one of our Southern
U||   juleps.”
U||   It was a fascination to Hargraves to watch him make it. He took rank
U||   among artists when he began, and he never varied the process. With what
U||   delicacy he bruised the mint; with what exquisite nicety he estimated
U||   the ingredients; with what solicitous care he capped the compound with
U||   the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe! And then the
U||   hospitality and grace with which he offered it, after the selected oat
U||   straws had been plunged into its tinkling depths!
U||   After about four months in Washington, Miss Lydia discovered one
U||   morning that they were almost without money. The Anecdotes and
U||   Reminiscences was completed, but publishers had not jumped at the
U||   collected gems of Alabama sense and wit. The rental of a small house
U||   which they still owned in Mobile was two months in arrears. Their board
U||   money for the month would be due in three days. Miss Lydia called her
U||   father to a consultation.
U||   “No money?” said he with a surprised look. “It is quite annoying to be
U||   called on so frequently for these petty sums, Really, I—”
U||   The Major searched his pockets. He found only a two-dollar bill, which
U||   he returned to his vest pocket.
U||   “I must attend to this at once, Lydia,” he said. “Kindly get me my
U||   umbrella and I will go downtown immediately. The congressman from our
U||   district, General Fulghum, assured me some days ago that he would use
U||   his influence to get my book published at an early date. I will go to
U||   his hotel at once and see what arrangement has been made.”
U||   With a sad little smile Miss Lydia watched him button his “Father
U||   Hubbard” and depart, pausing at the door, as he always did, to bow
U||   profoundly.
U||   That evening, at dark, he returned. It seemed that Congressman Fulghum
U||   had seen the publisher who had the Major’s manuscript for reading. That
U||   person had said that if the anecdotes, etc., were carefully pruned down
U||   about one-half, in order to eliminate the sectional and class prejudice
U||   with which the book was dyed from end to end, he might consider its
U||   publication.
U||   The Major was in a white heat of anger, but regained his equanimity,
U||   according to his code of manners, as soon as he was in Miss Lydia’s
U||   presence.
U||   “We must have money,” said Miss Lydia, with a little wrinkle above her
U||   nose. “Give me the two dollars, and I will telegraph to Uncle Ralph for
U||   some to-night.”
U||   The Major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and tossed
U||   it on the table.
U||   “Perhaps it was injudicious,” he said mildly, “but the sum was so
U||   merely nominal that I bought tickets to the theater to-night. It’s a
U||   new war drama, Lydia. I thought you would be pleased to witness its
U||   first production in Washington. I am told that the South has very fair
U||   treatment in the play. I confess I should like to see the performance
U||   myself.”
U||   Miss Lydia threw up her hands in silent despair.
U||   Still, as the tickets were bought, they might as well be used. So that
U||   evening, as they sat in the theater listening to the lively overture,
U||   even Miss Lydia was minded to relegate their troubles, for the hour, to
U||   second place. The Major, in spotless linen, with his extraordinary coat
U||   showing only where it was closely buttoned, and his white hair smoothly
U||   roached, looked really fine and distinguished. The curtain went up on
U||   the first act of A Magnolia Flower, revealing a typical Southern
U||   plantation scene. Major Talbot betrayed some interest.
U||   “Oh, see!” exclaimed Miss Lydia, nudging his arm, and pointing to her
U||   program.
U||   The Major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of
U||   characters that her fingers indicated.
U||   Col. Webster Calhoun .... Mr. Hopkins Hargraves.
U||   “It’s our Mr. Hargraves,” said Miss Lydia. “It must be his first
U||   appearance in what he calls ‘the legitimate.’ I’m so glad for him.”
U||   Not until the second act did Col. Webster Calhoun appear upon the
U||   stage. When he made his entry Major Talbot gave an audible sniff,
U||   glared at him, and seemed to freeze solid. Miss Lydia uttered a little,
U||   ambiguous squeak and crumpled her program in her hand. For Colonel
U||   Calhoun was made up as nearly resembling Major Talbot as one pea does
U||   another. The long, thin white hair, curly at the ends, the aristocratic
U||   beak of a nose, the crumpled, wide, raveling shirt front, the string
U||   tie, with the bow nearly under one ear, were almost exactly duplicated.
U||   And then, to clinch the imitation, he wore the twin to the Major’s
U||   supposed to be unparalleled coat. High-collared, baggy, empire-waisted,
U||   ample-skirted, hanging a foot lower in front than behind, the garment
U||   could have been designed from no other pattern. From then on, the Major
U||   and Miss Lydia sat bewitched, and saw the counterfeit presentment of a
U||   haughty Talbot “dragged,” as the Major afterward expressed it, “through
U||   the slanderous mire of a corrupt stage.”
U||   Mr. Hargraves had used his opportunities well. He had caught the
U||   Major’s little idiosyncrasies of speech, accent, and intonation and his
U||   pompous courtliness to perfection—exaggerating all to the purpose of
U||   the stage. When he performed that marvelous bow that the Major fondly
U||   imagined to be the pink of all salutations, the audience sent forth a
U||   sudden round of hearty applause.
U||   Miss Lydia sat immovable, not daring to glance toward her father.
U||   Sometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek, as if
U||   to conceal the smile which, in spite of her disapproval, she could not
U||   entirely suppress.
U||   The culmination of Hargraves audacious imitation took place in the
U||   third act. The scene is where Colonel Calhoun entertains a few of the
U||   neighboring planters in his “den.”
U||   Standing at a table in the center of the stage, with his friends
U||   grouped about him, he delivers that inimitable, rambling character
U||   monologue so famous in A Magnolia Flower, at the same time that he
U||   deftly makes juleps for the party.
U||   Major Talbot, sitting quietly, but white with indignation, heard his
U||   best stories retold, his pet theories and hobbies advanced and
U||   expanded, and the dream of the Anecdotes and Reminiscences served,
U||   exaggerated and garbled. His favorite narrative—that of his duel with
U||   Rathbone Culbertson—was not omitted, and it was delivered with more
U||   fire, egotism, and gusto than the Major himself put into it.
U||   The monologue concluded with a quaint, delicious, witty little lecture
U||   on the art of concocting a julep, illustrated by the act. Here Major
U||   Talbot’s delicate but showy science was reproduced to a hair’s
U||   breadth—from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed—“the
U||   one-thousandth part of a grain too much pressure, gentlemen, and you
U||   extract the bitterness, instead of the aroma, of this heaven-bestowed
U||   plant”—to his solicitous selection of the oaten straws.
U||   At the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of
U||   appreciation. The portrayal of the type was so exact, so sure and
U||   thorough, that the leading characters in the play were forgotten. After
U||   repeated calls, Hargraves came before the curtain and bowed, his rather
U||   boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success.
U||   At last Miss Lydia turned and looked at the Major. His thin nostrils
U||   were working like the gills of a fish. He laid both shaking hands upon
U||   the arms of his chair to rise.
U||   “We will go, Lydia,” he said chokingly. “This is an
U||   abominable—desecration.”
U||   Before he could rise, she pulled him back into his seat.
U||   “We will stay it out,” she declared. “Do you want to advertise the copy
U||   by exhibiting the original coat?” So they remained to the end.
U||   Hargraves’s success must have kept him up late that night, for neither
U||   at the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear.
U||   About three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of Major Talbot’s
U||   study. The Major opened it, and Hargraves walked in with his hands full
U||   of the morning papers—too full of his triumph to notice anything
U||   unusual in the Major’s demeanor.
U||   “I put it all over ’em last night, Major,” he began exultantly. “I had
U||   my inning, and, I think, scored. Here’s what The Post says:
U||   “‘His conception and portrayal of the old-time Southern colonel, with
U||   his absurd grandiloquence, his eccentric garb, his quaint idioms and
U||   phrases, his motheaten pride of family, and his really kind heart,
U||   fastidious sense of honor, and lovable simplicity, is the best
U||   delineation of a character role on the boards to-day. The coat worn by
U||   Colonel Calhoun is itself nothing less than an evolution of genius. Mr.
U||   Hargraves has captured his public.’
U||   “How does that sound, Major, for a first-nighter?”
U||   “I had the honor”—the Major’s voice sounded ominously frigid—“of
U||   witnessing your very remarkable performance, sir, last night.”
U||   Hargraves looked disconcerted.
U||   “You were there? I didn’t know you ever—I didn’t know you cared for the
U||   theater. Oh, I say, Major Talbot,” he exclaimed frankly, “don’t you be
U||   offended. I admit I did get a lot of pointers from you that helped out
U||   wonderfully in the part. But it’s a type, you know—not individual. The
U||   way the audience caught on shows that. Half the patrons of that theater
U||   are Southerners. They recognized it.”
U||   “Mr. Hargraves,” said the Major, who had remained standing, “you have
U||   put upon me an unpardonable insult. You have burlesqued my person,
U||   grossly betrayed my confidence, and misused my hospitality. If I
U||   thought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the sign
U||   manual of a gentleman, or what is due one, I would call you out, sir,
U||   old as I am. I will ask you to leave the room, sir.”
U||   The actor appeared to be slightly bewildered, and seemed hardly to take
U||   in the full meaning of the old gentleman’s words.
U||   “I am truly sorry you took offense,” he said regretfully. “Up here we
U||   don’t look at things just as you people do. I know men who would buy
U||   out half the house to have their personality put on the stage so the
U||   public would recognize it.”
U||   “They are not from Alabama, sir,” said the Major haughtily.
U||   “Perhaps not. I have a pretty good memory, Major; let me quote a few
U||   lines from your book. In response to a toast at a banquet given
U||   in—Milledgeville, I believe—you uttered, and intend to have printed,
U||   these words:
U||   “‘The Northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except in so
U||   far as the feelings may be turned to his own commercial profit. He will
U||   suffer without resentment any imputation cast upon the honor of himself
U||   or his loved ones that does not bear with it the consequence of
U||   pecuniary loss. In his charity, he gives with a liberal hand; but it
U||   must be heralded with the trumpet and chronicled in brass.’
U||   “Do you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of Colonel
U||   Calhoun last night?”
U||   “The description,” said the Major, frowning, “is—not without grounds.
U||   Some exag—latitude must be allowed in public speaking.”
U||   “And in public acting,” replied Hargraves.
U||   “That is not the point,” persisted the Major, unrelenting. “It was a
U||   personal caricature. I positively decline to overlook it, sir.”
U||   “Major Talbot,” said Hargraves, with a winning smile, “I wish you would
U||   understand me. I want you to know that I never dreamed of insulting
U||   you. In my profession, all life belongs to me. I take what I want, and
U||   what I can, and return it over the footlights. Now, if you will, let’s
U||   let it go at that. I came in to see you about something else. We’ve
U||   been pretty good friends for some months, and I’m going to take the
U||   risk of offending you again. I know you are hard up for money—never
U||   mind how I found out, a boarding house is no place to keep such matters
U||   secret—and I want you to let me help you out of the pinch. I’ve been
U||   there often enough myself. I’ve been getting a fair salary all the
U||   season, and I’ve saved some money. You’re welcome to a couple
U||   hundred—or even more—until you get——”
U||   “Stop!” commanded the Major, with his arm outstretched. “It seems that
U||   my book didn’t lie, after all. You think your money salve will heal all
U||   the hurts of honor. Under no circumstances would I accept a loan from a
U||   casual acquaintance; and as to you, sir, I would starve before I would
U||   consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the
U||   circumstances we have discussed. I beg to repeat my request relative to
U||   your quitting the apartment.”
U||   Hargraves took his departure without another word. He also left the
U||   house the same day, moving, as Mrs. Vardeman explained at the supper
U||   table, nearer the vicinity of the downtown theater, where A Magnolia
U||   Flower was booked for a week’s run.
U||   Critical was the situation with Major Talbot and Miss Lydia. There was
U||   no one in Washington to whom the Major’s scruples allowed him to apply
U||   for a loan. Miss Lydia wrote a letter to Uncle Ralph, but it was
U||   doubtful whether that relative’s constricted affairs would permit him
U||   to furnish help. The Major was forced to make an apologetic address to
U||   Mrs. Vardeman regarding the delayed payment for board, referring to
U||   “delinquent rentals” and “delayed remittances” in a rather confused
U||   strain.
U||   Deliverance came from an entirely unexpected source.
U||   Late one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old colored
U||   man who wanted to see Major Talbot. The Major asked that he be sent up
U||   to his study. Soon an old darkey appeared in the doorway, with his hat
U||   in hand, bowing, and scraping with one clumsy foot. He was quite
U||   decently dressed in a baggy suit of black. His big, coarse shoes shone
U||   with a metallic luster suggestive of stove polish. His bushy wool was
U||   gray—almost white. After middle life, it is difficult to estimate the
U||   age of a negro. This one might have seen as many years as had Major
U||   Talbot.
U||   “I be bound you don’t know me, Mars’ Pendleton,” were his first words.
U||   The Major rose and came forward at the old, familiar style of address.
U||   It was one of the old plantation darkeys without a doubt; but they had
U||   been widely scattered, and he could not recall the voice or face.
U||   “I don’t believe I do,” he said kindly—“unless you will assist my
U||   memory.”
U||   “Don’t you ’member Cindy’s Mose, Mars’ Pendleton, what ’migrated
U||   ’mediately after de war?”
U||   “Wait a moment,” said the Major, rubbing his forehead with the tips of
U||   his fingers. He loved to recall everything connected with those beloved
U||   days. “Cindy’s Mose,” he reflected. “You worked among the
U||   horses—breaking the colts. Yes, I remember now. After the surrender,
U||   you took the name of—don’t prompt me—Mitchell, and went to the West—to
U||   Nebraska.”
U||   “Yassir, yassir,”—the old man’s face stretched with a delighted
U||   grin—“dat’s him, dat’s it. Newbraska. Dat’s me—Mose Mitchell. Old Uncle
U||   Mose Mitchell, dey calls me now. Old mars’, your pa, gimme a pah of dem
U||   mule colts when I lef’ fur to staht me goin’ with. You ’member dem
U||   colts, Mars’ Pendleton?”
U||   “I don’t seem to recall the colts,” said the Major. “You know. I was
U||   married the first year of the war and living at the old Follinsbee
U||   place. But sit down, sit down, Uncle Mose. I’m glad to see you. I hope
U||   you have prospered.”
U||   Uncle Mose took a chair and laid his hat carefully on the floor beside
U||   it.
U||   “Yessir; of late I done mouty famous. When I first got to Newbraska,
U||   dey folks come all roun’ me to see dem mule colts. Dey ain’t see no
U||   mules like dem in Newbraska. I sold dem mules for three hundred
U||   dollars. Yessir—three hundred.
U||   “Den I open a blacksmith shop, suh, and made some money and bought some
U||   lan’. Me and my old ’oman done raised up seb’m chillun, and all doin’
U||   well ’cept two of ’em what died. Fo’ year ago a railroad come along and
U||   staht a town slam ag’inst my lan’, and, suh, Mars’ Pendleton, Uncle
U||   Mose am worth leb’m thousand dollars in money, property, and lan’.”
U||   “I’m glad to hear it,” said the Major heartily. “Glad to hear it.”
U||   “And dat little baby of yo’n, Mars’ Pendleton—one what you name Miss
U||   Lyddy—I be bound dat little tad done growed up tell nobody wouldn’t
U||   know her.”
U||   The Major stepped to the door and called: “Lydie, dear, will you come?”
U||   Miss Lydia, looking quite grown up and a little worried, came in from
U||   her room.
U||   “Dar, now! What’d I tell you? I knowed dat baby done be plum growed up.
U||   You don’t ’member Uncle Mose, child?”
U||   “This is Aunt Cindy’s Mose, Lydia,” explained the Major. “He left
U||   Sunnymead for the West when you were two years old.”
U||   “Well,” said Miss Lydia, “I can hardly be expected to remember you,
U||   Uncle Mose, at that age. And, as you say, I’m ’plum growed up,’ and was
U||   a blessed long time ago. But I’m glad to see you, even if I can’t
U||   remember you.”
U||   And she was. And so was the Major. Something alive and tangible had
U||   come to link them with the happy past. The three sat and talked over
U||   the olden times, the Major and Uncle Mose correcting or prompting each
U||   other as they reviewed the plantation scenes and days.
U||   The Major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home.
U||   “Uncle Mose am a delicate,” he explained, “to de grand Baptis’
U||   convention in dis city. I never preached none, but bein’ a residin’
U||   elder in de church, and able fur to pay my own expenses, dey sent me
U||   along.”
U||   “And how did you know we were in Washington?” inquired Miss Lydia.
U||   “Dey’s a cullud man works in de hotel whar I stops, what comes from
U||   Mobile. He told me he seen Mars’ Pendleton comin’ outen dish here house
U||   one mawnin’.
U||   “What I come fur,” continued Uncle Mose, reaching into his
U||   pocket—“besides de sight of home folks—was to pay Mars’ Pendleton what
U||   I owes him.
U||   “Yessir—three hundred dollars.” He handed the Major a roll of bills.
U||   “When I lef’ old mars’ says: ‘‘Take dem mule colts, Mose, and, if it be
U||   so you gits able, pay fur ’em.’ Yessir—dem was his words. De war had
U||   done lef’ old mars’ po’ hisself. Old mars’ bein’ long ago dead, de debt
U||   descends to Mars’ Pendleton. Three hundred dollars. Uncle Mose is
U||   plenty able to pay now. When dat railroad buy my lan’ I laid off to pay
U||   fur dem mules. Count de money, Mars’ Pendleton. Dat’s what I sold dem
U||   mules fur. Yessir.”
U||   Tears were in Major Talbot’s eyes. He took Uncle Mose’s hand and laid
U||   his other upon his shoulder.
U||   “Dear, faithful, old servitor,” he said in an unsteady voice, “I don’t
U||   mind saying to you that ‘‘Mars’ Pendleton spent his last dollar in the
U||   world a week ago. We will accept this money, Uncle Mose, since, in a
U||   way, it is a sort of payment, as well as a token of the loyalty and
U||   devotion of the old régime. Lydia, my dear, take the money. You are
U||   better fitted than I to manage its expenditure.”
U||   “Take it, honey,” said Uncle Mose. “Hit belongs to you. Hit’s Talbot
U||   money.”
U||   After Uncle Mose had gone, Miss Lydia had a good cry—-for joy; and the
U||   Major turned his face to a corner, and smoked his clay pipe
U||   volcanically.
U||   The succeeding days saw the Talbots restored to peace and ease. Miss
U||   Lydia’s face lost its worried look. The major appeared in a new frock
U||   coat, in which he looked like a wax figure personifying the memory of
U||   his golden age. Another publisher who read the manuscript of the
U||   Anecdotes and Reminiscences thought that, with a little retouching and
U||   toning down of the high lights, he could make a really bright and
U||   salable volume of it. Altogether, the situation was comfortable, and
U||   not without the touch of hope that is often sweeter than arrived
U||   blessings.
U||   One day, about a week after their piece of good luck, a maid brought a
U||   letter for Miss Lydia to her room. The postmark showed that it was from
U||   New York. Not knowing any one there, Miss Lydia, in a mild flutter of
U||   wonder, sat down by her table and opened the letter with her scissors.
U||   This was what she read:
U||   Dear Miss Talbot:
U||   I thought you might be glad to learn of my good fortune. I have
U||   received and accepted an offer of two hundred dollars per week by a New
U||   York stock company to play Colonel Calhoun in A Magnolia Flower.
U||   There is something else I wanted you to know. I guess you’d better not
U||   tell Major Talbot. I was anxious to make him some amends for the great
U||   help he was to me in studying the part, and for the bad humor he was in
U||   about it. He refused to let me, so I did it anyhow. I could easily
U||   spare the three hundred.
U||   Sincerely yours,
U||   H. Hopkins Hargraves.
U||   P.S. How did I play Uncle Mose?
U||   Major Talbot, passing through the hall, saw Miss Lydia’s door open and
U||   stopped.
U||   “Any mail for us this morning, Lydia, dear?” he asked.
U||   Miss Lydia slid the letter beneath a fold of her dress.
U||   “The Mobile Chronicle came,” she said promptly. “It’s on the table in
U||   your study.”

U||BARGAIN DAY AT TUTT HOUSE[69][25]
U||   By George Randolph Chester (1869- )
U||  I
U||   Just as the stage rumbled over the rickety old bridge, creaking and
U||   groaning, the sun came from behind the clouds that had frowned all the
U||   way, and the passengers cheered up a bit. The two richly dressed
U||   matrons who had been so utterly and unnecessarily oblivious to the
U||   presence of each other now suspended hostilities for the moment by
U||   mutual and unspoken consent, and viewed with relief the little,
U||   golden-tinted valley and the tree-clad road just beyond. The respective
U||   husbands of these two ladies exchanged a mere glance, no more, of
U||   comfort. They, too, were relieved, though more by the momentary truce
U||   than by anything else. They regretted very much to be compelled to hate
U||   each other, for each had reckoned up his vis-à-vis as a rather proper
U||   sort of fellow, probably a man of some achievement, used to good living
U||   and good company.
U||   Extreme iciness was unavoidable between them, however. When one
U||   stranger has a splendidly preserved blonde wife and the other a
U||   splendidly preserved brunette wife, both of whom have won social
U||   prominence by years of hard fighting and aloofness, there remains
U||   nothing for the two men but to follow the lead, especially when
U||   directly under the eyes of the leaders.
U||   The son of the blonde matron smiled cheerfully as the welcome light
U||   flooded the coach.
U||   He was a nice-looking young man, of about twenty-two, one might judge,
U||   and he did his smiling, though in a perfectly impersonal and correct
U||   sort of manner, at the pretty daughter of the brunette matron. The
U||   pretty daughter also smiled, but her smile was demurely directed at the
U||   trees outside, clad as they were in all the flaming glory of their
U||   autumn tints, glistening with the recent rain and dripping with gems
U||   that sparkled and flashed in the noonday sun as they fell.
U||   It is marvelous how much one can see out of the corner of the eye,
U||   while seeming to view mere scenery.
U||   The driver looked down, as he drove safely off the bridge, and shook
U||   his head at the swirl of water that rushed and eddied, dark and muddy,
U||   close up under the rotten planking; then he cracked his whip, and the
U||   horses sturdily attacked the little hill.
U||   Thick, overhanging trees on either side now dimmed the light again, and
U||   the two plump matrons once more glared past the opposite shoulders,
U||   profoundly unaware of each other. The husbands took on the politely
U||   surly look required of them. The blonde son’s eyes still sought the
U||   brunette daughter, but it was furtively done and quite unsuccessfully,
U||   for the daughter was now doing a little glaring on her own account. The
U||   blonde matron had just swept her eyes across the daughter’s skirt,
U||   estimating the fit and material of it with contempt so artistically
U||   veiled that it could almost be understood in the dark.
U||  II
U||   The big bays swung to the brow of the hill with ease, and dashed into a
U||   small circular clearing, where a quaint little two-story building, with
U||   a mossy watering-trough out in front, nestled under the shade of
U||   majestic old trees that reared their brown and scarlet crowns proudly
U||   into the sky. A long, low porch ran across the front of the structure,
U||   and a complaining sign hung out announcing, in dim, weather-flecked
U||   letters on a cracked board, that this was the “Tutt House.” A
U||   gray-headed man, in brown overalls and faded blue jumper, stood on the
U||   porch and shook his fist at the stage as it whirled by.
U||   “What a delightfully old-fashioned inn!” exclaimed the pretty daughter.
U||   “How I should like to stop there over night!”
U||   “You would probably wish yourself away before morning, Evelyn,” replied
U||   her mother indifferently. “No doubt it would be a mere siege of
U||   discomfort.”
U||   The blonde matron turned to her husband. The pretty daughter had been
U||   looking at the picturesque “inn” between the heads of this lady and her
U||   son.
U||   “Edward, please pull down the shade behind me,” she directed. “There is
U||   quite a draught from that broken window.”
U||   The pretty daughter bit her lip. The brunette matron continued to stare
U||   at the shade in the exact spot upon which her gaze had been before
U||   directed, and she never quivered an eyelash. The young man seemed very
U||   uncomfortable, and he tried to look his apologies to the pretty
U||   daughter, but she could not see him now, not even if her eyes had been
U||   all corners.
U||   They were bowling along through another avenue of trees when the driver
U||   suddenly shouted, “Whoa there!”
U||   The horses were brought up with a jerk that was well nigh fatal to the
U||   assortment of dignity inside the coach. A loud roaring could be heard,
U||   both ahead and in the rear, a sharp splitting like a fusillade of
U||   pistol shots, then a creaking and tearing of timbers. The driver bent
U||   suddenly forward.
U||   “Gid ap!” he cried, and the horses sprang forward with a lurch. He
U||   swung them around a sharp bend with a skillful hand and poised his
U||   weight above the brake as they plunged at terrific speed down a steep
U||   grade. The roaring was louder than ever now, and it became deafening as
U||   they suddenly emerged from the thick underbrush at the bottom of the
U||   declivity.
U||   “Caught, by gravy!” ejaculated the driver, and, for the second time, he
U||   brought the coach to an abrupt stop.
U||   “Do see what is the matter, Ralph,” said the blonde matron impatiently.
U||   Thus commanded, the young man swung out and asked the driver about it.
U||   “Paintsville dam’s busted,” he was informed. “I been a-lookin’ fer it
U||   this many a year, an’ this here freshet done it. You see the holler
U||   there? Well, they’s ten foot o’ water in it, an’ it had ort to be stone
U||   dry. The bridge is tore out behind us, an’ we’re stuck here till that
U||   water runs out. We can’t git away till to-morry, anyways.”
U||   He pointed out the peculiar topography of the place, and Ralph got back
U||   in the coach.
U||   “We’re practically on a flood-made island,” he exclaimed, with one eye
U||   on the pretty daughter, “and we shall have to stop over night at that
U||   quaint, old-fashioned inn we passed a few moments ago.”
U||   The pretty daughter’s eyes twinkled, and he thought he caught a swift,
U||   direct gleam from under the long lashes—but he was not sure.
U||   “Dear me, how annoying,” said the blonde matron, but the brunette
U||   matron still stared, without the slightest trace of interest in
U||   anything else, at the infinitesimal spot she had selected on the
U||   affronting window-shade.
U||   The two men gave sighs of resignation, and cast carefully concealed
U||   glances at each other, speculating on the possibility of a cigar and a
U||   glass, and maybe a good story or two, or possibly even a game of poker
U||   after the evening meal. Who could tell what might or might not happen?
U||  III
U||   When the stage drew up in front of the little hotel, it found Uncle
U||   Billy Tutt prepared for his revenge. In former days the stage had
U||   always stopped at the Tutt House for the noonday meal. Since the new
U||   railway was built through the adjoining county, however, the stage trip
U||   became a mere twelve-mile, cross-country transfer from one railroad to
U||   another, and the stage made a later trip, allowing the passengers
U||   plenty of time for “dinner” before they started. Day after day, as the
U||   coach flashed by with its money-laden passengers, Uncle Billy had hoped
U||   that it would break down. But this was better, much better. The coach
U||   might be quickly mended, but not the flood.
U||   “I’m a-goin’ t’ charge ’em till they squeal,” he declared to the
U||   timidly protesting Aunt Margaret, “an’ then I’m goin’ t’ charge ’em a
U||   least mite more, drat ’em!”
U||   He retreated behind the rough wooden counter that did duty as a desk,
U||   slammed open the flimsy, paper-bound “cash book” that served as a
U||   register, and planted his elbows uncompromisingly on either side of it.
U||   “Let ’em bring in their own traps,” he commented, and Aunt Margaret
U||   fled, ashamed and conscience-smitten, to the kitchen. It seemed awful.
U||   The first one out of the coach was the husband of the brunette matron,
U||   and, proceeding under instructions, he waited neither for luggage nor
U||   women folk, but hurried straight into the Tutt House. The other man
U||   would have been neck and neck with him in the race, if it had not been
U||   that he paused to seize two suitcases and had the misfortune to drop
U||   one, which burst open and scattered a choice assortment of lingerie
U||   from one end of the dingy coach to the other.
U||   In the confusion of rescuing the fluffery, the owner of the suitcase
U||   had to sacrifice her hauteur and help her husband and son block up the
U||   aisle, while the other matron had the ineffable satisfaction of being
U||   kept waiting, at last being enabled to say, sweetly and with the most
U||   polite consideration:
U||   “Will you kindly allow me to pass?”
U||   The blonde matron raised up and swept her skirts back perfectly flat.
U||   She was pale but collected. Her husband was pink but collected. Her son
U||   was crimson and uncollected. The brunette daughter could not have found
U||   an eye anywhere in his countenance as she rustled out after her mother.
U||   “I do hope that Belmont has been able to secure choice quarters,” the
U||   triumphing matron remarked as her daughter joined her on the ground.
U||   “This place looked so very small that there can scarcely be more than
U||   one comfortable suite in it.”
U||   It was a vital thrust. Only a splendidly cultivated self-control
U||   prevented the blonde matron from retaliating upon the unfortunate who
U||   had muddled things. Even so, her eyes spoke whole shelves of volumes.
U||   The man who first reached the register wrote, in a straight black
U||   scrawl, “J. Belmont Van Kamp, wife, and daughter.” There being no space
U||   left for his address, he put none down.
U||   “I want three adjoining rooms, en suite if possible,” he demanded.
U||   “Three!” exclaimed Uncle Billy, scratching his head. “Won’t two do ye?
U||   I ain’t got but six bedrooms in th’ house. Me an’ Marg’t sleeps in one,
U||   an’ we’re a-gittin’ too old fer a shake-down on th’ floor. I’ll have t’
U||   save one room fer th’ driver, an’ that leaves four. You take two now—-”
U||   Mr. Van Kamp cast a hasty glance out of the window, The other man was
U||   getting out of the coach. His own wife was stepping on the porch.
U||   “What do you ask for meals and lodging until this time to-morrow?” he
U||   interrupted.
U||   The decisive moment had arrived. Uncle Billy drew a deep breath.
U||   “Two dollars a head!” he defiantly announced. There! It was out! He
U||   wished Margaret had stayed to hear him say it.
U||   The guest did not seem to be seriously shocked, and Uncle Billy was
U||   beginning to be sorry he had not said three dollars, when Mr. Van Kamp
U||   stopped the landlord’s own breath.
U||   “I’ll give you fifteen dollars for the three best rooms in the house,”
U||   he calmly said, and Landlord Tutt gasped as the money fluttered down
U||   under his nose.
U||   “Jis’ take yore folks right on up, Mr. Kamp,” said Uncle Billy,
U||   pouncing on the money. “Th’ rooms is th’ three right along th’ hull
U||   front o’ th’ house. I’ll be up and make on a fire in a minute. Jis’
U||   take th’ Jonesville Banner an’ th’ Uticky Clarion along with ye.”
U||   As the swish of skirts marked the passage of the Van Kamps up the wide
U||   hall stairway, the other party swept into the room.
U||   The man wrote, in a round flourish, “Edward Eastman Ellsworth, wife,
U||   and son.”
U||   “I’d like three choice rooms, en suite,” he said.
U||   “Gosh!” said Uncle Billy, regretfully. “That’s what Mr. Kamp wanted,
U||   fust off, an’ he got it. They hain’t but th’ little room over th’
U||   kitchen left. I’ll have to put you an’ your wife in that, an’ let your
U||   boy sleep with th’ driver.”
U||   The consternation in the Ellsworth party was past calculating by any
U||   known standards of measurement. The thing was an outrage! It was not to
U||   be borne! They would not submit to it!
U||   Uncle Billy, however, secure in his mastery of the situation, calmly
U||   quartered them as he had said. “An’ let ’em splutter all they want to,”
U||   he commented comfortably to himself.
U||  IV
U||   The Ellsworths were holding a family indignation meeting on the broad
U||   porch when the Van Ramps came contentedly down for a walk, and brushed
U||   by them with unseeing eyes.
U||   “It makes a perfectly fascinating suite,” observed Mrs. Van Kamp, in a
U||   pleasantly conversational tone that could be easily overheard by anyone
U||   impolite enough to listen. “That delightful old-fashioned fireplace in
U||   the middle apartment makes it an ideal sitting-room, and the beds are
U||   so roomy and comfortable.”
U||   “I just knew it would be like this!” chirruped Miss Evelyn. “I remarked
U||   as we passed the place, if you will remember, how charming it would be
U||   to stop in this dear, quaint old inn over night. All my wishes seem to
U||   come true this year.”
U||   These simple and, of course, entirely unpremeditated remarks were as
U||   vinegar and wormwood to Mrs. Ellsworth, and she gazed after the
U||   retreating Van Kamps with a glint in her eye that would make one
U||   understand Lucretia Borgia at last.
U||   Her son also gazed after the retreating Van Kamp. She had an exquisite
U||   figure, and she carried herself with a most delectable grace. As the
U||   party drew away from the inn she dropped behind the elders and wandered
U||   off into a side path to gather autumn leaves.
U||   Ralph, too, started off for a walk, but naturally not in the same
U||   direction.
U||   “Edward!” suddenly said Mrs. Ellsworth. “I want you to turn those
U||   people out of that suite before night!”
U||   “Very well,” he replied with a sigh, and got up to do it. He had
U||   wrecked a railroad and made one, and had operated successful corners in
U||   nutmegs and chicory. No task seemed impossible. He walked in to see the
U||   landlord.
U||   “What are the Van Kamps paying you for those three rooms?” he asked.
U||   “Fifteen dollars,” Uncle Billy informed him, smoking one of Mr. Van
U||   Kamp’s good cigars and twiddling his thumbs in huge content.
U||   “I’ll give you thirty for them. Just set their baggage outside and tell
U||   them the rooms are occupied.”
U||   “No sir-ree!” rejoined Uncle Billy. “A bargain’s a bargain, an’ I allus
U||   stick to one I make.”
U||   Mr. Ellsworth withdrew, but not defeated. He had never supposed that
U||   such an absurd proposition would be accepted. It was only a feeler, and
U||   he had noticed a wince of regret in his landlord. He sat down on the
U||   porch and lit a strong cigar. His wife did not bother him. She gazed
U||   complacently at the flaming foliage opposite, and allowed him to think.
U||   Getting impossible things was his business in life, and she had
U||   confidence in him.
U||   “I want to rent your entire house for a week,” he announced to Uncle
U||   Billy a few minutes later. It had occurred to him that the flood might
U||   last longer than they anticipated.
U||   Uncle Billy’s eyes twinkled.
U||   “I reckon it kin be did,” he allowed. “I reckon a ho-tel man’s got a
U||   right to rent his hull house ary minute.”
U||   “Of course he has. How much do you want?”
U||   Uncle Billy had made one mistake in not asking this sort of folks
U||   enough, and he reflected in perplexity.
U||   “Make me a offer,” he proposed. “Ef it hain’t enough I’ll tell ye. You
U||   want to rent th’ hull place, back lot an’ all?”
U||   “No, just the mere house. That will be enough,” answered the other with
U||   a smile. He was on the point of offering a hundred dollars, when he saw
U||   the little wrinkles about Mr. Tutt’s eyes, and he said seventy-five.
U||   “Sho, ye’re jokin’!” retorted Uncle Billy. He had been considered a
U||   fine horse-trader in that part of the country. “Make it a hundred and
U||   twenty-five, an’ I’ll go ye.”
U||   Mr. Ellsworth counted out some bills.
U||   “Here’s a hundred,” he said. “That ought to be about right.”
U||   “Fifteen more,” insisted Uncle Billy.
U||   With a little frown of impatience the other counted off the extra money
U||   and handed it over. Uncle Billy gravely handed it back.
U||   “Them’s the fifteen dollars Mr. Kamp give me,” he explained. “You’ve
U||   got the hull house fer a week, an’ o’ course all th’ money that’s
U||   tooken in is your’n. You kin do as ye please about rentin’ out rooms to
U||   other folks, I reckon. A bargain’s a bargain, an’ I allus stick to one
U||   I make.”
U||  V
U||   Ralph Ellsworth stalked among the trees, feverishly searching for
U||   squirrels, scarlet leaves, and the glint of a brown walking-dress, this
U||   last not being so easy to locate in sunlit autumn woods. Time after
U||   time he quickened his pace, only to find that he had been fooled by a
U||   patch of dogwood, a clump of haw bushes or even a leaf-strewn knoll,
U||   but at last he unmistakably saw the dress, and then he slowed down to a
U||   careless saunter.
U||   She was reaching up for some brilliantly colored maple leaves, and was
U||   entirely unconscious of his presence, especially after she had seen
U||   him. Her pose showed her pretty figure to advantage, but, of course,
U||   she did not know that. How should she?
U||   Ralph admired the picture very much. The hat, the hair, the gown, the
U||   dainty shoes, even the narrow strip of silken hose that was revealed as
U||   she stood a-uptoe, were all of a deep, rich brown that proved an
U||   exquisite foil for the pink and cream of her cheeks. He remembered that
U||   her eyes were almost the same shade, and wondered how it was that
U||   women-folk happened on combinations in dress that so well set off their
U||   natural charms. The fool!
U||   He was about three trees away, now, and a panic akin to that which
U||   hunters describe as “buck ague” seized him. He decided that he really
U||   had no excuse for coming any nearer. It would not do, either, to be
U||   seen staring at her if she should happen to turn her head, so he veered
U||   off, intending to regain the road. It would be impossible to do this
U||   without passing directly in her range of vision, and he did not intend
U||   to try to avoid it. He had a fine, manly figure of his own.
U||   He had just passed the nearest radius to her circle and was proceeding
U||   along the tangent that he had laid out for himself, when the unwitting
U||   maid looked carefully down and saw a tangle of roots at her very feet.
U||   She was so unfortunate, a second later, as to slip her foot in this
U||   very tangle and give her ankle ever so slight a twist.
U||   “Oh!” cried Miss Van Kamp, and Ralph Ellsworth flew to the rescue. He
U||   had not been noticing her at all, and yet he had started to her side
U||   before she had even cried out, which was strange. She had a very
U||   attractive voice.
U||   “May I be of assistance?” he anxiously inquired.
U||   “I think not, thank you,” she replied, compressing her lips to keep
U||   back the intolerable pain, and half-closing her eyes to show the fine
U||   lashes. Declining the proffered help, she extricated her foot, picked
U||   up her autumn branches, and turned away. She was intensely averse to
U||   anything that could be construed as a flirtation, even of the mildest,
U||   he could certainly see that. She took a step, swayed slightly, dropped
U||   the leaves, and clutched out her hand to him.
U||   “It is nothing,” she assured him in a moment, withdrawing the hand
U||   after he had held it quite long enough. “Nothing whatever. I gave my
U||   foot a slight wrench, and turned the least bit faint for a moment.”
U||   “You must permit me to walk back, at least to the road, with you,” he
U||   insisted, gathering up her armload of branches. “I couldn’t think of
U||   leaving you here alone.”
U||   As he stooped to raise the gay woodland treasures he smiled to himself,
U||   ever so slightly. This was not his first season out, either.
U||   “Delightful spot, isn’t it?” he observed as they regained the road and
U||   sauntered in the direction of the Tutt House.
U||   “Quite so,” she reservedly answered. She had noticed that smile as he
U||   stooped. He must be snubbed a little. It would be so good for him.
U||   “You don’t happen to know Billy Evans, of Boston, do you?” he asked.
U||   “I think not. I am but very little acquainted in Boston.”
U||   “Too bad,” he went on. “I was rather in hopes you knew Billy. All sorts
U||   of a splendid fellow, and knows everybody.”
U||   “Not quite, it seems,” she reminded him, and he winced at the error. In
U||   spite of the sly smile that he had permitted to himself, he was
U||   unusually interested.
U||   He tried the weather, the flood, the accident, golf, books and three
U||   good, substantial, warranted jokes, but the conversation lagged in
U||   spite of him. Miss Van Kamp would not for the world have it understood
U||   that this unconventional meeting, made allowable by her wrenched ankle,
U||   could possibly fulfill the functions of a formal introduction.
U||   “What a ripping, queer old building that is!” he exclaimed, making one
U||   more brave effort as they came in sight of the hotel.
U||   “It is, rather,” she assented. “The rooms in it are as quaint and
U||   delightful as the exterior, too.”
U||   She looked as harmless and innocent as a basket of peaches as she said
U||   it, and never the suspicion of a smile deepened the dimple in the cheek
U||   toward him. The smile was glowing cheerfully away inside, though. He
U||   could feel it, if he could not see it, and he laughed aloud.
U||   “Your crowd rather got the better of us there,” he admitted with the
U||   keen appreciation of one still quite close to college days.
U||   “Of course, the mater is furious, but I rather look on it as a lark.”
U||   She thawed like an April icicle.
U||   “It’s perfectly jolly,” she laughed with him. “Awfully selfish of us,
U||   too, I know, but such loads of fun.”
U||   They were close to the Tutt House now, and her limp, that had entirely
U||   disappeared as they emerged from the woods, now became quite
U||   perceptible. There might be people looking out of the windows, though
U||   it is hard to see why that should affect a limp.
U||   Ralph was delighted to find that a thaw had set in, and he made one
U||   more attempt to establish at least a proxy acquaintance.
U||   “You don’t happen to know Peyson Kingsley, of Philadelphia, do you?”
U||   “I’m afraid I don’t,” she replied. “I know so few Philadelphia people,
U||   you see.” She was rather regretful about it this time. He really was a
U||   clever sort of a fellow, in spite of that smile.
U||   The center window in the second floor of the Tutt House swung open, its
U||   little squares of glass flashing jubilantly in the sunlight. Mrs.
U||   Ellsworth leaned out over the sill, from the quaint old sitting-room of
U||   the Van Kamp apartments!
U||   “Oh, Ralph!” she called in her most dulcet tones. “Kindly excuse
U||   yourself and come right on up to our suite for a few moments!”
U||  VI
U||   It is not nearly so easy to take a practical joke as to perpetrate one.
U||   Evelyn was sitting thoughtfully on the porch when her father and mother
U||   returned. Mrs. Ellsworth was sitting at the center window above,
U||   placidly looking out. Her eyes swept carelessly over the Van Kamps, and
U||   unconcernedly passed on to the rest of the landscape.
U||   Mrs. Van Kamp gasped and clutched the arm of her husband. There was no
U||   need. He, too, had seen the apparition. Evelyn now, for the first time,
U||   saw the real humor of the situation. She smiled as she thought of
U||   Ralph. She owed him one, but she never worried about her debts. She
U||   always managed to get them paid, principal and interest.
U||   Mr. Van Kamp suddenly glowered and strode into the Tutt House. Uncle
U||   Billy met him at the door, reflectively chewing a straw, and handed him
U||   an envelope. Mr. Van Kamp tore it open and drew out a note. Three
U||   five-dollar bills came out with it and fluttered to the porch floor.
U||   This missive confronted him:
U||   Mr. J. Belmont Van Kamp,
U||   Dear Sir: This is to notify you that I have rented the entire Tutt
U||   House for the ensuing week, and am compelled to assume possession of
U||   the three second-floor front rooms. Herewith I am enclosing the fifteen
U||   dollars you paid to secure the suite. You are quite welcome to make
U||   use, as my guest, of the small room over the kitchen. You will find
U||   your luggage in that room. Regretting any inconvenience that this
U||   transaction may cause you, I am,
U||   Yours respectfully,
U||   Edward Eastman Ellsworth.
U||   Mr. Van Kamp passed the note to his wife and sat down on a large chair.
U||   He was glad that the chair was comfortable and roomy. Evelyn picked up
U||   the bills and tucked them into her waist. She never overlooked any of
U||   her perquisites. Mrs. Van Kamp read the note, and the tip of her nose
U||   became white. She also sat down, but she was the first to find her
U||   voice.
U||   “Atrocious!” she exclaimed. “Atrocious! Simply atrocious, Belmont. This
U||   is a house of public entertainment. They can’t turn us out in this
U||   high-minded manner! Isn’t there a law or something to that effect?”
U||   “It wouldn’t matter if there was,” he thoughtfully replied. “This
U||   fellow Ellsworth would be too clever to be caught by it. He would say
U||   that the house was not a hotel but a private residence during the
U||   period for which he has rented it.”
U||   Personally, he rather admired Ellsworth. Seemed to be a resourceful
U||   sort of chap who knew how to make money behave itself, and do its
U||   little tricks without balking in the harness.
U||   “Then you can make him take down the sign!” his wife declared.
U||   He shook his head decidedly.
U||   “It wouldn’t do, Belle,” he replied. “It would be spite, not
U||   retaliation, and not at all sportsmanlike. The course you suggest would
U||   belittle us more than it would annoy them. There must be some other
U||   way.”
U||   He went in to talk with Uncle Billy.
U||   “I want to buy this place,” he stated. “Is it for sale?”
U||   “It sartin is!” replied Uncle Billy. He did not merely twinkle this
U||   time. He grinned.
U||   “How much?”
U||   “Three thousand dollars.” Mr. Tutt was used to charging by this time,
U||   and he betrayed no hesitation.
U||   “I’ll write you out a check at once,” and Mr. Van Kamp reached in his
U||   pocket with the reflection that the spot, after all, was an ideal one
U||   for a quiet summer retreat.
U||   “Air you a-goin’ t’ scribble that there three thou-san’ on a piece o’
U||   paper?” inquired Uncle Billy, sitting bolt upright. “Ef you air
U||   a-figgerin’ on that, Mr. Kamp, jis’ you save yore time. I give a man
U||   four dollars fer one o’ them check things oncet, an’ I owe myself them
U||   four dollars yit.”
U||   Mr. Van Kamp retired in disorder, but the thought of his wife and
U||   daughter waiting confidently on the porch stopped him. Moreover, the
U||   thing had resolved itself rather into a contest between Ellsworth and
U||   himself, and he had done a little making and breaking of men and things
U||   in his own time. He did some gatling-gun thinking out by the
U||   newel-post, and presently rejoined Uncle Billy.
U||   “Mr. Tutt, tell me just exactly what Mr. Ellsworth rented, please,” he
U||   requested.
U||   “Th’ hull house,” replied Billy, and then he somewhat sternly added:
U||   “Paid me spot cash fer it, too.”
U||   Mr. Van Kamp took a wad of loose bills from his trousers pocket,
U||   straightened them out leisurely, and placed them in his bill book,
U||   along with some smooth yellowbacks of eye-bulging denominations. Uncle
U||   Billy sat up and stopped twiddling his thumbs.
U||   “Nothing was said about the furniture, was there?” suavely inquired Van
U||   Kamp.
U||   Uncle Billy leaned blankly back in his chair. Little by little the
U||   light dawned on the ex-horse-trader. The crow’s feet reappeared about
U||   his eyes, his mouth twitched, he smiled, he grinned, then he slapped
U||   his thigh and haw-hawed.
U||   “No!” roared Uncle Billy. “No, there wasn’t, by gum!”
U||   “Nothing but the house?”
U||   “His very own words!” chuckled Uncle Billy. “‘‘Jis’ th’ mere house,’
U||   says he, an’ he gits it. A bargain’s a bargain, an’ I allus stick to
U||   one I make.”
U||   “How much for the furniture for the week?”
U||   “Fifty dollars!” Mr. Tutt knew how to do business with this kind of
U||   people now, you bet.
U||   Mr. Van Kamp promptly counted out the money.
U||   “Drat it!” commented Uncle Billy to himself. “I could ’a’ got more!”
U||   “Now where can we make ourselves comfortable with this furniture?”
U||   Uncle Billy chirked up. All was not yet lost.
U||   “Waal,” he reflectively drawled, “there’s th’ new barn. It hain’t been
U||   used for nothin’ yit, senct I built it two years ago. I jis’ hadn’t th’
U||   heart t’ put th’ critters in it as long as th’ ole one stood up.”
U||   The other smiled at this flashlight on Uncle Billy’s character, and
U||   they went out to look at the barn.
U||  VII
U||   Uncle Billy came back from the “Tutt House Annex,” as Mr. Van Kamp
U||   dubbed the barn, with enough more money to make him love all the world
U||   until he got used to having it. Uncle Billy belongs to a large family.
U||   Mr. Van Kamp joined the women on the porch, and explained the
U||   attractively novel situation to them. They were chatting gaily when the
U||   Ellsworths came down the stairs. Mr. Ellsworth paused for a moment to
U||   exchange a word with Uncle Billy.
U||   “Mr. Tutt,” said he, laughing, “if we go for a bit of exercise will you
U||   guarantee us the possession of our rooms when we come back?”
U||   “Yes sir-ree!” Uncle Billy assured him. “They shan’t nobody take them
U||   rooms away from you fer money, marbles, ner chalk. A bargain’s a
U||   bargain, an’ I allus stick to one I make,” and he virtuously took a
U||   chew of tobacco while he inspected the afternoon sky with a clear
U||   conscience.
U||   “I want to get some of those splendid autumn leaves to decorate our
U||   cozy apartments,” Mrs. Ellsworth told her husband as they passed in
U||   hearing of the Van Kamps. “Do you know those old-time rag rugs are the
U||   most oddly decorative effects that I have ever seen. They are so rich
U||   in color and so exquisitely blended.”
U||   There were reasons why this poisoned arrow failed to rankle, but the
U||   Van Kamps did not trouble to explain. They were waiting for Ralph to
U||   come out and join his parents. Ralph, it seemed, however, had decided
U||   not to take a walk. He had already fatigued himself, he had explained,
U||   and his mother had favored him with a significant look. She could
U||   readily believe him, she had assured him, and had then left him in
U||   scorn.
U||   The Van Kamps went out to consider the arrangement of the barn. Evelyn
U||   returned first and came out on the porch to find a handkerchief. It was
U||   not there, but Ralph was. She was very much surprised to see him, and
U||   she intimated as much.
U||   “It’s dreadfully damp in the woods,” he explained. “By the way, you
U||   don’t happen to know the Whitleys, of Washington, do you? Most
U||   excellent people.”
U||   “I’m quite sorry that I do not,” she replied. “But you will have to
U||   excuse me. We shall be kept very busy with arranging our apartments.”
U||   Ralph sprang to his feet with a ludicrous expression.
U||   “Not the second floor front suite!” he exclaimed.
U||   “Oh, no! Not at all,” she reassured him.
U||   He laughed lightly.
U||   “Honors are about even in that game,” he said.
U||   “Evelyn,” called her mother from the hall. “Please come and take those
U||   front suite curtains down to the barn.”
U||   “Pardon me while we take the next trick,” remarked Evelyn with a laugh
U||   quite as light and gleeful as his own, and disappeared into the hall.
U||   He followed her slowly, and was met at the door by her father.
U||   “You are the younger Mr. Ellsworth, I believe,” politely said Mr. Van
U||   Kamp.
U||   “Ralph Ellsworth. Yes, sir.”
U||   “Here is a note for your father. It is unsealed. You are quite at
U||   liberty to read it.”
U||   Mr. Van Kamp bowed himself away, and Ralph opened the note, which read:
U||   Edward Eastman Ellsworth, Esq.,
U||   Dear Sir: This is to notify you that I have rented the entire furniture
U||   of the Tutt House for the ensuing week, and am compelled to assume
U||   possession of that in the three second floor front rooms, as well as
U||   all the balance not in actual use by Mr. and Mrs. Tutt and the driver
U||   of the stage. You are quite welcome, however, to make use of the
U||   furnishings in the small room over the kitchen. Your luggage you will
U||   find undisturbed. Regretting any inconvenience that this transaction
U||   may cause you, I remain,
U||   Yours respectfully,
U||   J. Belmont Van Kamp.
U||   Ralph scratched his head in amused perplexity. It devolved upon him to
U||   even up the affair a little before his mother came back. He must
U||   support the family reputation for resourcefulness, but it took quite a
U||   bit of scalp irritation before he aggravated the right idea into being.
U||   As soon as the idea came, he went in and made a hide-bound bargain with
U||   Uncle Billy, then he went out into the hall and waited until Evelyn
U||   came down with a huge armload of window curtains.
U||   “Honors are still even,” he remarked. “I have just bought all the
U||   edibles about the place, whether in the cellar, the house or any of the
U||   surrounding structures, in the ground, above the ground, dead or alive,
U||   and a bargain’s a bargain as between man and man.”
U||   “Clever of you, I’m sure,” commented Miss Van Kamp, reflectively.
U||   Suddenly her lips parted with a smile that revealed a double row of
U||   most beautiful teeth. He meditatively watched the curve of her lips.
U||   “Isn’t that rather a heavy load?” he suggested. “I’d be delighted to
U||   help you move the things, don’t you know.”
U||   “It is quite kind of you, and what the men would call ‘‘game,’ I
U||   believe, under the circumstances,” she answered, “but really it will
U||   not be necessary. We have hired Mr. Tutt and the driver to do the
U||   heavier part of the work, and the rest of it will be really a pleasant
U||   diversion.”
U||   “No doubt,” agreed Ralph, with an appreciative grin. “By the way, you
U||   don’t happen to know Maud and Dorothy Partridge, of Baltimore, do you?
U||   Stunning pretty girls, both of them, and no end of swells.”
U||   “I know so very few people in Baltimore,” she murmured, and tripped on
U||   down to the barn.
U||   Ralph went out on the porch and smoked. There was nothing else that he
U||   could do.
U||  VIII
U||   It was growing dusk when the elder Ellsworths returned, almost hidden
U||   by great masses of autumn boughs.
U||   “You should have been with us, Ralph,” enthusiastically said his
U||   mother. “I never saw such gorgeous tints in all my life. We have
U||   brought nearly the entire woods with us.”
U||   “It was a good idea,” said Ralph. “A stunning good idea. They may come
U||   in handy to sleep on.”
U||   Mrs. Ellsworth turned cold.
U||   “What do you mean?” she gasped.
U||   “Ralph,” sternly demanded his father, “you don’t mean to tell us that
U||   you let the Van Kamps jockey us out of those rooms after all?”
U||   “Indeed, no,” he airily responded. “Just come right on up and see.”
U||   He led the way into the suite and struck a match. One solitary candle
U||   had been left upon the mantel shelf. Ralph thought that this had been
U||   overlooked, but his mother afterwards set him right about that. Mrs.
U||   Van Kamp had cleverly left it so that the Ellsworths could see how
U||   dreadfully bare the place was. One candle in three rooms is drearier
U||   than darkness anyhow.
U||   Mrs. Ellsworth took in all the desolation, the dismal expanse of the
U||   now enormous apartments, the shabby walls, the hideous bright spots
U||   where pictures had hung, the splintered flooring, the great, gaunt
U||   windows—and she gave in. She had met with snub after snub, and cut
U||   after cut, in her social climb, she had had the cook quit in the middle
U||   of an important dinner, she had had every disconcerting thing possible
U||   happen to her, but this—this was the last bale of straw. She sat down
U||   on a suitcase, in the middle of the biggest room, and cried!
U||   Ralph, having waited for this, now told about the food transaction, and
U||   she hastily pushed the last-coming tear back into her eye.
U||   “Good!” she cried. “They will be up here soon. They will be compelled
U||   to compromise, and they must not find me with red eyes.”
U||   She cast a hasty glance around the room, then, in a sudden panic,
U||   seized the candle and explored the other two. She went wildly out into
U||   the hall, back into the little room over the kitchen, downstairs,
U||   everywhere, and returned in consternation.
U||   “There’s not a single mirror left in the house!” she moaned.
U||   Ralph heartlessly grinned. He could appreciate that this was a
U||   characteristic woman trick, and wondered admiringly whether Evelyn or
U||   her mother had thought of it. However, this was a time for action.
U||   “I’ll get you some water to bathe your eyes,” he offered, and ran into
U||   the little room over the kitchen to get a pitcher. A cracked
U||   shaving-mug was the only vessel that had been left, but he hurried down
U||   into the yard with it. This was no time for fastidiousness.
U||   He had barely creaked the pump handle when Mr. Van Kamp hurried up from
U||   the barn.
U||   “I beg your pardon, sir,” said Mr. Van Kamp, “but this water belongs to
U||   us. My daughter bought it, all that is in the ground, above the ground,
U||   or that may fall from the sky upon these premises.”
U||  IX
U||   The mutual siege lasted until after seven o’clock, but it was rather
U||   one-sided. The Van Kamps could drink all the water they liked, it made
U||   them no hungrier. If the Ellsworths ate anything, however, they grew
U||   thirstier, and, moreover, water was necessary if anything worth while
U||   was to be cooked. They knew all this, and resisted until Mrs. Ellsworth
U||   was tempted and fell. She ate a sandwich and choked. It was
U||   heartbreaking, but Ralph had to be sent down with a plate of sandwiches
U||   and an offer to trade them for water.
U||   Halfway between the pump and the house he met Evelyn coming with a
U||   small pail of the precious fluid. They both stopped stock still; then,
U||   seeing that it was too late to retreat, both laughed and advanced.
U||   “Who wins now?” bantered Ralph as they made the exchange.
U||   “It looks to me like a misdeal,” she gaily replied, and was moving away
U||   when he called her back.
U||   “You don’t happen to know the Gately’s, of New York, do you?” he was
U||   quite anxious to know.
U||   “I am truly sorry, but I am acquainted with so few people in New York.
U||   We are from Chicago, you know.”
U||   “Oh,” said he blankly, and took the water up to the Ellsworth suite.
U||   Mrs. Ellsworth cheered up considerably when she heard that Ralph had
U||   been met half-way, but her eyes snapped when he confessed that it was
U||   Miss Van Kamp who had met him.
U||   “I hope you are not going to carry on a flirtation with that
U||   overdressed creature,” she blazed.
U||   “Why mother,” exclaimed Ralph, shocked beyond measure. “What right have
U||   you to accuse either this young lady or myself of flirting? Flirting!”
U||   Mrs. Ellsworth suddenly attacked the fire with quite unnecessary
U||   energy.
U||  X
U||   Down at the barn, the wide threshing floor had been covered with gay
U||   rag-rugs, and strewn with tables, couches, and chairs in picturesque
U||   profusion. Roomy box-stalls had been carpeted deep with clean straw,
U||   curtained off with gaudy bed-quilts, and converted into cozy sleeping
U||   apartments. The mow and the stalls had been screened off with lace
U||   curtains and blazing counterpanes, and the whole effect was one of
U||   Oriental luxury and splendor. Alas, it was only an “effect”! The
U||   red-hot parlor stove smoked abominably, the pipe carried other smoke
U||   out through the hawmow window, only to let it blow back again. Chill
U||   cross-draughts whistled in from cracks too numerous to be stopped up,
U||   and the miserable Van Kamps could only cough and shiver, and envy the
U||   Tutts and the driver, non-combatants who had been fed two hours before.
U||   Up in the second floor suite there was a roaring fire in the big
U||   fireplace, but there was a chill in the room that no mere fire could
U||   drive away—the chill of absolute emptiness.
U||   A man can outlive hardships that would kill a woman, but a woman can
U||   endure discomforts that would drive a man crazy.
U||   Mr. Ellsworth went out to hunt up Uncle Billy, with an especial solace
U||   in mind. The landlord was not in the house, but the yellow gleam of a
U||   lantern revealed his presence in the woodshed, and Mr. Ellsworth
U||   stepped in upon him just as he was pouring something yellow and clear
U||   into a tumbler from a big jug that he had just taken from under the
U||   flooring.
U||   “How much do you want for that jug and its contents?” he asked, with a
U||   sigh of gratitude that this supply had been overlooked.
U||   Before Mr. Tutt could answer, Mr. Van Kamp hurried in at the door.
U||   “Wait a moment!” he cried. “I want to bid on that!”
U||   “This here jug hain’t fer sale at no price,” Uncle Billy emphatically
U||   announced, nipping all negotiations right in the bud. “It’s too pesky
U||   hard to sneak this here licker in past Marge’t, but I reckon it’s my
U||   treat, gents. Ye kin have all ye want.”
U||   One minute later Mr. Van Kamp and Mr. Ellsworth were seated, one on a
U||   sawbuck and the other on a nail-keg, comfortably eyeing each other
U||   across the work bench, and each was holding up a tumbler one-third
U||   filled with the golden yellow liquid.
U||   “Your health, sir,” courteously proposed Mr. Ellsworth.
U||   “And to you, sir,” gravely replied Mr. Van Kamp.
U||  XI
U||   Ralph and Evelyn happened to meet at the pump, quite accidentally,
U||   after the former had made half a dozen five-minute-apart trips for a
U||   drink. It was Miss Van Kamp, this time, who had been studying on the
U||   mutual acquaintance problem.
U||   “You don’t happen to know the Tylers, of Parkersburg, do you?” she
U||   asked.
U||   “The Tylers! I should say I do!” was the unexpected and enthusiastic
U||   reply. “Why, we are on our way now to Miss Georgiana Tyler’s wedding to
U||   my friend Jimmy Carston. I’m to be best man.”
U||   “How delightful!” she exclaimed. “We are on the way there, too.
U||   Georgiana was my dearest chum at school, and I am to be her ‘‘best
U||   girl.’”
U||   “Let’s go around on the porch and sit down,” said Ralph.
U||  XII
U||   Mr. Van Kamp, back in the woodshed, looked about him with an eye of
U||   content.
U||   “Rather cozy for a woodshed,” he observed. “I wonder if we couldn’t
U||   scare up a little session of dollar limit?”
U||   Both Uncle Billy and Mr. Ellsworth were willing. Death and poker level
U||   all Americans. A fourth hand was needed, however. The stage driver was
U||   in bed and asleep, and Mr. Ellsworth volunteered to find the extra
U||   player.
U||   “I’ll get Ralph,” he said. “He plays a fairly stiff game.” He finally
U||   found his son on the porch, apparently alone, and stated his errand.
U||   “Thank you, but I don’t believe I care to play this evening,” was the
U||   astounding reply, and Mr. Ellsworth looked closer. He made out, then, a
U||   dim figure on the other side of Ralph.
U||   “Oh! Of course not!” he blundered, and went back to the woodshed.
U||   Three-handed poker is a miserable game, and it seldom lasts long. It
U||   did not in this case. After Uncle Billy had won the only jack-pot
U||   deserving of the name, he was allowed to go blissfully to sleep with
U||   his hand on the handle of the big jug.
U||   After poker there is only one other always available amusement for men,
U||   and that is business. The two travelers were quite well acquainted when
U||   Ralph put his head in at the door.
U||   “Thought I’d find you here,” he explained. “It just occurred to me to
U||   wonder whether you gentlemen had discovered, as yet, that we are all to
U||   be house guests at the Carston-Tyler wedding.”
U||   “Why, no!” exclaimed his father in pleased surprise. “It is a most
U||   agreeable coincidence. Mr. Van Kamp, allow me to introduce my son,
U||   Ralph. Mr. Van Kamp and myself, Ralph, have found out that we shall be
U||   considerably thrown together in a business way from now on. He has just
U||   purchased control of the Metropolitan and Western string of
U||   interurbans.”
U||   “Delighted, I’m sure,” murmured Ralph, shaking hands, and then he
U||   slipped out as quickly as possible. Some one seemed to be waiting for
U||   him.
U||   Perhaps another twenty minutes had passed, when one of the men had an
U||   illuminating idea that resulted, later on, in pleasant relations for
U||   all of them. It was about time, for Mrs. Ellsworth, up in the bare
U||   suite, and Mrs. Van Kamp, down in the draughty barn, both wrapped up to
U||   the chin and both still chilly, had about reached the limit of patience
U||   and endurance.
U||   “Why can’t we make things a little more comfortable for all concerned?”
U||   suggested Mr. Van Kamp. “Suppose, as a starter, that we have Mrs. Van
U||   Kamp give a shiver party down in the barn?”
U||   “Good idea,” agreed Mr. Ellsworth. “A little diplomacy will do it. Each
U||   one of us will have to tell his wife that the other fellow made the
U||   first abject overtures.”
U||   Mr. Van Kamp grinned understandingly, and agreed to the infamous ruse.
U||   “By the way,” continued Mr. Ellsworth, with a still happier thought,
U||   “you must allow Mrs. Ellsworth to furnish the dinner for Mrs. Van
U||   Kamp’s shiver party.”
U||   “Dinner!” gasped Mr. Van Kamp. “By all means!”
U||   Both men felt an anxious yawning in the region of the appetite, and a
U||   yearning moisture wetted their tongues. They looked at the slumbering
U||   Uncle Billy and decided to see Mrs. Tutt themselves about a good, hot
U||   dinner for six.
U||   “Law me!” exclaimed Aunt Margaret when they appeared at the kitchen
U||   door. “I swan I thought you folks ’u’d never come to yore senses. Here
U||   I’ve had a big pot o’ stewed chicken ready on the stove fer two mortal
U||   hours. I kin give ye that, an’ smashed taters an’ chicken gravy, an’
U||   dried corn, an’ hot corn-pone, an’ currant jell, an’ strawberry
U||   preserves, an’ my own cannin’ o’ peaches, an’ pumpkin-pie an’ coffee.
U||   Will that do ye?” Would it do! Would it do!!
U||   As Aunt Margaret talked, the kitchen door swung wide, and the two men
U||   were stricken speechless with astonishment. There, across from each
U||   other at the kitchen table, sat the utterly selfish and traitorous
U||   younger members of the rival houses of Ellsworth and Van Kamp, deep in
U||   the joys of chicken, and mashed potatoes, and gravy, and hot corn-pone,
U||   and all the other “fixings,” laughing and chatting gaily like chums of
U||   years’ standing. They had seemingly just come to an agreement about
U||   something or other, for Evelyn, waving the shorter end of a broken
U||   wishbone, was vivaciously saying to Ralph:
U||   “A bargain’s a bargain, and I always stick to one I make.”

U||A CALL[71][26]
U||   By Grace MacGowan Cooke (1863- )
U||   A boy in an unnaturally clean, country-laundered collar walked down a
U||   long white road. He scuffed the dust up wantonly, for he wished to veil
U||   the all-too-brilliant polish of his cowhide shoes. Also the memory of
U||   the whiteness and slipperiness of his collar oppressed him. He was fain
U||   to look like one accustomed to social diversions, a man hurried from
U||   hall to hall of pleasure, without time between to change collar or
U||   polish boot. He stooped and rubbed a crumb of earth on his overfresh
U||   neck-linen.
U||   This did not long sustain his drooping spirit. He was mentally adrift
U||   upon the Hints and Helps to Young Men in Business and Social Relations,
U||   which had suggested to him his present enterprise, when the appearance
U||   of a second youth, taller and broader than himself, with a shock of
U||   light curling hair and a crop of freckles that advertised a rich soil
U||   threw him a lifeline. He put his thumbs to his lips and whistled in a
U||   peculiarly ear-splitting way. The two boys had sat on the same bench at
U||   Sunday-school not three hours before; yet what a change had come over
U||   the world for one of them since then!
U||   “Hello! Where you goin’, Ab?” asked the newcomer, gruffly.
U||   “Callin’,” replied the boy in the collar, laconically, but with
U||   carefully averted gaze.
U||   “On the girls?” inquired the other, awestruck. In Mount Pisgah you saw
U||   the girls home from night church, socials, or parties; you could hang
U||   over the gate; and you might walk with a girl in the cemetery of a
U||   Sunday afternoon; but to ring a front-door bell and ask for Miss
U||   Heart’s Desire one must have been in long trousers at least three
U||   years—and the two boys confronted in the dusty road had worn these
U||   dignifying garments barely six months.
U||   “Girls,” said Abner, loftily; “I don’t know about girls—I’m just going
U||   to call on one girl—Champe Claiborne.” He marched on as though the
U||   conversation was at an end; but Ross hung upon his flank. Ross and
U||   Champe were neighbors, comrades in all sorts of mischief; he was in
U||   doubt whether to halt Abner and pummel him, or propose to enlist under
U||   his banner.
U||   “Do you reckon you could?” he debated, trotting along by the
U||   irresponsive Jilton boy.
U||   “Run home to your mother,” growled the originator of the plan,
U||   savagely. “You ain’t old enough to call on girls; anybody can see that;
U||   but I am, and I’m going to call on Champe Claiborne.”
U||   Again the name acted as a spur on Ross. “With your collar and boots all
U||   dirty?” he jeered. “They won’t know you’re callin’.”
U||   The boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. He was an
U||   intense creature, and he whitened at the tragic insinuation, longing
U||   for the wholesome stay and companionship of freckle-faced Ross. “I put
U||   the dirt on o’ purpose so’s to look kind of careless,” he half
U||   whispered, in an agony of doubt. “S’pose I’d better go into your house
U||   and try to wash it off? Reckon your mother would let me?”
U||   “I’ve got two clean collars,” announced the other boy, proudly
U||   generous. “I’ll lend you one. You can put it on while I’m getting
U||   ready. I’ll tell mother that we’re just stepping out to do a little
U||   calling on the girls.”
U||   Here was an ally worthy of the cause. Abner welcomed him, in spite of
U||   certain jealous twinges. He reflected with satisfaction that there were
U||   two Claiborne girls, and though Alicia was so stiff and prim that no
U||   boy would ever think of calling on her, there was still the hope that
U||   she might draw Ross’s fire, and leave him, Abner, to make the numerous
U||   remarks he had stored up in his mind from Hints and Helps to Young Men
U||   in Social and Business Relations to Champe alone.
U||   Mrs. Pryor received them with the easy-going kindness of the mother of
U||   one son. She followed them into the dining-room to kiss and feed him,
U||   with an absent “Howdy, Abner; how’s your mother?”
U||   Abner, big with the importance of their mutual intention, inclined his
U||   head stiffly and looked toward Ross for explanation. He trembled a
U||   little, but it was with delight, as he anticipated the effect of the
U||   speech Ross had outlined. But it did not come.
U||   “I’m not hungry, mother,” was the revised edition which the
U||   freckle-faced boy offered to the maternal ear. “I—we are going over to
U||   Mr. Claiborne’s—on—er—on an errand for Abner’s father.”
U||   The black-eyed boy looked reproach as they clattered up the stairs to
U||   Ross’s room, where the clean collar was produced and a small stock of
U||   ties.
U||   “You’d wear a necktie—wouldn’t you?” Ross asked, spreading them upon
U||   the bureau-top.
U||   “Yes. But make it fall carelessly over your shirt-front,” advised the
U||   student of Hints and Helps. “Your collar is miles too big for me. Say!
U||   I’ve got a wad of white chewing-gum; would you flat it out and stick it
U||   over the collar button? Maybe that would fill up some. You kick my foot
U||   if you see me turning my head so’s to knock it off.”
U||   “Better button up your vest,” cautioned Ross, laboring with the
U||   “careless” fall of his tie.
U||   “Huh-uh! I want ‘‘that easy air which presupposes familiarity with
U||   society’—that’s what it says in my book,” objected Abner.
U||   “Sure!” Ross returned to his more familiar jeering attitude. “Loosen up
U||   all your clothes, then. Why don’t you untie your shoes? Flop a sock
U||   down over one of ’em—that looks ‘‘easy’ all right.”
U||   Abner buttoned his vest. “It gives a man lots of confidence to know
U||   he’s good-looking,” he remarked, taking all the room in front of the
U||   mirror.
U||   Ross, at the wash-stand soaking his hair to get the curl out of it,
U||   grumbled some unintelligible response. The two boys went down the
U||   stairs with tremulous hearts.
U||   “Why, you’ve put on another clean shirt, Rossie!” Mrs. Pryor called
U||   from her chair—mothers’ eyes can see so far! “Well—don’t get into any
U||   dirty play and soil it.” The boys walked in silence—but it was a
U||   pregnant silence; for as the roof of the Claiborne house began to peer
U||   above the crest of the hill, Ross plumped down on a stone and
U||   announced, “I ain’t goin’.”
U||   “Come on,” urged the black-eyed boy. “It’ll be fun—and everybody will
U||   respect us more. Champe won’t throw rocks at us in recess-time, after
U||   we’ve called on her. She couldn’t.”
U||   “Called!” grunted Ross. “I couldn’t make a call any more than a cow.
U||   What’d I say? What’d I do? I can behave all right when you just go to
U||   people’s houses—but a call!”
U||   Abner hesitated. Should he give away his brilliant inside information,
U||   drawn from the Hints and Helps book, and be rivalled in the glory of
U||   his manners and bearing? Why should he not pass on alone, perfectly
U||   composed, and reap the field of glory unsupported? His knees gave way
U||   and he sat down without intending it.
U||   “Don’t you tell anybody and I’ll put you on to exactly what grown-up
U||   gentlemen say and do when they go calling on the girls,” he began.
U||   “Fire away,” retorted Ross, gloomily. “Nobody will find out from me.
U||   Dead men tell no tales. If I’m fool enough to go, I don’t expect to
U||   come out of it alive.”
U||   Abner rose, white and shaking, and thrusting three fingers into the
U||   buttoning of his vest, extending the other hand like an orator,
U||   proceeded to instruct the freckled, perspiring disciple at his feet.
U||   “‘Hang your hat on the rack, or give it to a servant.’” Ross nodded
U||   intelligently. He could do that.
U||   “‘Let your legs be gracefully disposed, one hand on the knee, the
U||   other—’”
U||   Abner came to an unhappy pause. “I forget what a fellow does with the
U||   other hand. Might stick it in your pocket, loudly, or expectorate on
U||   the carpet. Indulge in little frivolity. Let a rich stream of
U||   conversation flow.’”
U||   Ross mentally dug within himself for sources of rich streams of
U||   conversation. He found a dry soil. “What you goin’ to talk about?” he
U||   demanded, fretfully. “I won’t go a step farther till I know what I’m
U||   goin’ to say when I get there.”
U||   Abner began to repeat paragraphs from Hints and Helps. “‘‘It is best to
U||   remark,’” he opened, in an unnatural voice, “‘‘How well you are
U||   looking!’ although fulsome compliments should be avoided. When seated
U||   ask the young lady who her favorite composer is.’”
U||   “What’s a composer?” inquired Ross, with visions of soothing-syrup in
U||   his mind.
U||   “A man that makes up music. Don’t butt in that way; you put me all
U||   out—‘‘composer is. Name yours. Ask her what piece of music she likes
U||   best. Name yours. If the lady is musical, here ask her to play or
U||   sing.’”
U||   This chanted recitation seemed to have a hypnotic effect on the
U||   freckled boy; his big pupils contracted each time Abner came to the
U||   repetend, “Name yours.”
U||   “I’m tired already,” he grumbled; but some spell made him rise and fare
U||   farther.
U||   When they had entered the Claiborne gate, they leaned toward each other
U||   like young saplings weakened at the root and locking branches to keep
U||   what shallow foothold on earth remained.
U||   “You’re goin’ in first,” asserted Ross, but without conviction. It was
U||   his custom to tear up to this house a dozen times a week, on his
U||   father’s old horse or afoot; he was wont to yell for Champe as he
U||   approached, and quarrel joyously with her while he performed such
U||   errand as he had come upon; but he was gagged and hamstrung now by the
U||   hypnotism of Abner’s scheme.
U||   “‘‘Walk quietly up the steps; ring the bell and lay your card on the
U||   servant,’” quoted Abner, who had never heard of a server.
U||   “‘‘Lay your card on the servant!’” echoed Ross. “Cady’d dodge. There’s
U||   a porch to cross after you go up the steps—does it say anything about
U||   that?”
U||   “It says that the card should be placed on the servant,” Abner
U||   reiterated, doggedly. “If Cady dodges, it ain’t any business of mine.
U||   There are no porches in my book. Just walk across it like anybody.
U||   We’ll ask for Miss Champe Claiborne.”
U||   “We haven’t got any cards,” discovered Ross, with hope.
U||   “I have,” announced Abner, pompously. “I had some struck off in
U||   Chicago. I ordered ’em by mail. They got my name Pillow, but there’s a
U||   scalloped gilt border around it. You can write your name on my card.
U||   Got a pencil?”
U||   He produced the bit of cardboard; Ross fished up a chewed stump of lead
U||   pencil, took it in cold, stiff fingers, and disfigured the square with
U||   eccentric scribblings.
U||   “They’ll know who it’s meant for,” he said, apologetically, “because
U||   I’m here. What’s likely to happen after we get rid of the card?”
U||   “I told you about hanging your hat on the rack and disposing your
U||   legs.”
U||   “I remember now,” sighed Ross. They had been going slower and slower.
U||   The angle of inclination toward each other became more and more
U||   pronounced.
U||   “We must stand by each other,” whispered Abner.
U||   “I will—if I can stand at all,” murmured the other boy, huskily.
U||   “Oh, Lord!” They had rounded the big clump of evergreens and found Aunt
U||   Missouri Claiborne placidly rocking on the front porch! Directed to
U||   mount steps and ring bell, to lay cards upon the servant, how should
U||   one deal with a rosy-faced, plump lady of uncertain years in a
U||   rocking-chair. What should a caller lay upon her? A lion in the way
U||   could not have been more terrifying. Even retreat was cut off. Aunt
U||   Missouri had seen them. “Howdy, boys; how are you?” she said, rocking
U||   peacefully. The two stood before her like detected criminals.
U||   Then, to Ross’s dismay, Abner sank down on the lowest step of the
U||   porch, the westering sun full in his hopeless eyes. He sat on his cap.
U||   It was characteristic that the freckled boy remained standing. He would
U||   walk up those steps according to plan and agreement, if at all. He
U||   accepted no compromise. Folding his straw hat into a battered cone, he
U||   watched anxiously for the delivery of the card. He was not sure what
U||   Aunt Missouri’s attitude might be if it were laid on her. He bent down
U||   to his companion. “Go ahead,” he whispered. “Lay the card.”
U||   Abner raised appealing eyes. “In a minute. Give me time,” he pleaded.
U||   “Mars’ Ross—Mars’ Ross! Head ’em off!” sounded a yell, and Babe, the
U||   house-boy, came around the porch in pursuit of two half-grown chickens.
U||   “Help him, Rossie,” prompted Aunt Missouri, sharply. “You boys can stay
U||   to supper and have some of the chicken if you help catch them.”
U||   Had Ross taken time to think, he might have reflected that gentlemen
U||   making formal calls seldom join in a chase after the main dish of the
U||   family supper. But the needs of Babe were instant. The lad flung
U||   himself sidewise, caught one chicken in his hat, while Babe fell upon
U||   the other in the manner of a football player. Ross handed the pullet to
U||   the house-boy, fearing that he had done something very much out of
U||   character, then pulled the reluctant negro toward to the steps.
U||   “Babe’s a servant,” he whispered to Abner, who had sat rigid through
U||   the entire performance. “I helped him with the chickens, and he’s got
U||   to stand gentle while you lay the card on.”
U||   Confronted by the act itself, Abner was suddenly aware that he knew not
U||   how to begin. He took refuge in dissimulation.
U||   “Hush!” he whispered back. “Don’t you see Mr. Claiborne’s come
U||   out?—He’s going to read something to us.”
U||   Ross plumped down beside him. “Never mind the card; tell ’em,” he
U||   urged.
U||   “Tell ’em yourself.”
U||   “No—let’s cut and run.”
U||   “I—I think the worst of it is over. When Champe sees us she’ll—”
U||   Mention of Champe stiffened Ross’s spine. If it had been glorious to
U||   call upon her, how very terrible she would make it should they attempt
U||   calling, fail, and the failure come to her knowledge! Some things were
U||   easier to endure than others; he resolved to stay till the call was
U||   made.
U||   For half an hour the boys sat with drooping heads, and the old
U||   gentleman read aloud, presumably to Aunt Missouri and themselves.
U||   Finally their restless eyes discerned the two Claiborne girls walking
U||   serene in Sunday trim under the trees at the edge of the lawn. Arms
U||   entwined, they were whispering together and giggling a little. A
U||   caller, Ross dared not use his voice to shout nor his legs to run
U||   toward them.
U||   “Why don’t you go and talk to the girls, Rossie?” Aunt Missouri asked,
U||   in the kindness of her heart. “Don’t be noisy—it’s Sunday, you know—and
U||   don’t get to playing anything that’ll dirty up your good clothes.”
U||   Ross pressed his lips hard together; his heart swelled with the rage of
U||   the misunderstood. Had the card been in his possession, he would, at
U||   that instant, have laid it on Aunt Missouri without a qualm.
U||   “What is it?” demanded the old gentleman, a bit testily.
U||   “The girls want to hear you read, father,” said Aunt Missouri,
U||   shrewdly; and she got up and trotted on short, fat ankles to the girls
U||   in the arbor. The three returned together, Alicia casting curious
U||   glances at the uncomfortable youths, Champe threatening to burst into
U||   giggles with every breath.
U||   Abner sat hard on his cap and blushed silently. Ross twisted his hat
U||   into a three-cornered wreck.
U||   The two girls settled themselves noisily on the upper step. The old man
U||   read on and on. The sun sank lower. The hills were red in the west as
U||   though a brush fire flamed behind their crests. Abner stole a furtive
U||   glance at his companion in misery, and the dolor of Ross’s countenance
U||   somewhat assuaged his anguish. The freckle-faced boy was thinking of
U||   the village over the hill, a certain pleasant white house set back in a
U||   green yard, past whose gate, the two-plank sidewalk ran. He knew lamps
U||   were beginning to wink in the windows of the neighbors about, as though
U||   the houses said, “Our boys are all at home—but Ross Pryor’s out trying
U||   to call on the girls, and can’t get anybody to understand it.” Oh, that
U||   he were walking down those two planks, drawing a stick across the
U||   pickets, lifting high happy feet which could turn in at that gate! He
U||   wouldn’t care what the lamps said then. He wouldn’t even mind if the
U||   whole Claiborne family died laughing at him—if only some power would
U||   raise him up from this paralyzing spot and put him behind the safe
U||   barriers of his own home!
U||   The old man’s voice lapsed into silence; the light was becoming too dim
U||   for his reading. Aunt Missouri turned and called over her shoulder into
U||   the shadows of the big hall: “You Babe! Go put two extra plates on the
U||   supper-table.”
U||   The boys grew red from the tips of their ears, and as far as any one
U||   could see under their wilting collars. Abner felt the lump of gum come
U||   loose and slip down a cold spine. Had their intentions but been known,
U||   this inferential invitation would have been most welcome. It was but to
U||   rise up and thunder out, “We came to call on the young ladies.”
U||   They did not rise. They did not thunder out anything. Babe brought a
U||   lamp and set it inside the window, and Mr. Claiborne resumed his
U||   reading. Champe giggled and said that Alicia made her. Alcia drew her
U||   skirts about her, sniffed, and looked virtuous, and said she didn’t see
U||   anything funny to laugh at. The supper-bell rang. The family, evidently
U||   taking it for granted that the boys would follow, went in.
U||   Alone for the first time, Abner gave up. “This ain’t any use,” he
U||   complained. “We ain’t calling on anybody.”
U||   “Why didn’t you lay on the card?” demanded Ross, fiercely. “Why didn’t
U||   you say: ‘‘We’ve-just-dropped-into-call-on-Miss-Champe. It’s-a
U||   -pleasant-evening. We-feel-we-must-be-going,’ like you said you would?
U||   Then we could have lifted our hats and got away decently.”
U||   Abner showed no resentment.
U||   “Oh, if it’s so easy, why didn’t you do it yourself?” he groaned.
U||   “Somebody’s coming,” Ross muttered, hoarsely. “Say it now. Say it
U||   quick.”
U||   The somebody proved to be Aunt Missouri, who advanced only as far as
U||   the end of the hall and shouted cheerfully: “The idea of a growing boy
U||   not coming to meals when the bell rings! I thought you two would be in
U||   there ahead of us. Come on.” And clinging to their head-coverings as
U||   though these contained some charm whereby the owners might be rescued,
U||   the unhappy callers were herded into the dining-room. There were many
U||   things on the table that boys like. Both were becoming fairly cheerful,
U||   when Aunt Missouri checked the biscuit-plate with: “I treat my
U||   neighbors’ children just like I’d want children of my own treated. If
U||   your mothers let you eat all you want, say so, and I don’t care; but if
U||   either of them is a little bit particular, why, I’d stop at six!”
U||   Still reeling from this blow, the boys finally rose from the table and
U||   passed out with the family, their hats clutched to their bosoms, and
U||   clinging together for mutual aid and comfort. During the usual
U||   Sunday-evening singing Champe laughed till Aunt Missouri threatened to
U||   send her to bed. Abner’s card slipped from his hand and dropped face up
U||   on the floor. He fell upon it and tore it into infinitesimal pieces.
U||   “That must have been a love-letter,” said Aunt Missouri, in a pause of
U||   the music. “You boys are getting ‘‘most old enough to think about
U||   beginning to call on the girls.” Her eyes twinkled.
U||   Ross growled like a stoned cur. Abner took a sudden dive into Hints and
U||   Helps, and came up with, “You flatter us, Miss Claiborne,” whereat Ross
U||   snickered out like a human boy. They all stared at him.
U||   “It sounds so funny to call Aunt Missouri ‘‘Mis’ Claiborne,’” the lad
U||   of the freckles explained.
U||   “Funny?” Aunt Missouri reddened. “I don’t see any particular joke in my
U||   having my maiden name.”
U||   Abner, who instantly guessed at what was in Ross’s mind, turned white
U||   at the thought of what they had escaped. Suppose he had laid on the
U||   card and asked for Miss Claiborne!
U||   “What’s the matter, Champe?” inquired Ross, in a fairly natural tone.
U||   The air he had drawn into his lungs when he laughed at Abner seemed to
U||   relieve him from the numbing gentility which had bound his powers since
U||   he joined Abner’s ranks.
U||   “Nothing. I laughed because you laughed,” said the girl.
U||   The singing went forward fitfully. Servants traipsed through the
U||   darkened yard, going home for Sunday night. Aunt Missouri went out and
U||   held some low-toned parley with them. Champe yawned with insulting
U||   enthusiasm. Presently both girls quietly disappeared. Aunt Missouri
U||   never returned to the parlor—evidently thinking that the girls would
U||   attend to the final amenities with their callers. They were left alone
U||   with old Mr. Claiborne. They sat as though bound in their chairs, while
U||   the old man read in silence for a while. Finally he closed his book,
U||   glanced about him, and observed absently:
U||   “So you boys were to spend the night?” Then, as he looked at their
U||   startled faces: “I’m right, am I not? You are to spent the night?”
U||   Oh, for courage to say: “Thank you, no. We’ll be going now. We just
U||   came over to call on Miss Champe.” But thought of how this would sound
U||   in face of the facts, the painful realization that they dared not say
U||   it because they had not said it, locked their lips. Their feet were
U||   lead; their tongues stiff and too large for their mouths. Like
U||   creatures in a nightmare, they moved stiffly, one might have said
U||   creakingly, up the stairs and received each—a bedroom candle!
U||   “Good night, children,” said the absent-minded old man. The two gurgled
U||   out some sounds which were intended for words and doged behind the
U||   bedroom door.
U||   “They’ve put us to bed!” Abner’s black eyes flashed fire. His nervous
U||   hands clutched at the collar Ross had lent him. “That’s what I get for
U||   coming here with you, Ross Pryor!” And tears of humiliation stood in
U||   his eyes.
U||   In his turn Ross showed no resentment. “What I’m worried about is my
U||   mother,” he confessed. “She’s so sharp about finding out things. She
U||   wouldn’t tease me—she’d just be sorry for me. But she’ll think I went
U||   home with you.”
U||   “I’d like to see my mother make a fuss about my calling on the girls!”
U||   growled Abner, glad to let his rage take a safe direction.
U||   “Calling on the girls! Have we called on any girls?” demanded
U||   clear-headed, honest Ross.
U||   “Not exactly—yet,” admitted Abner, reluctantly. “Come on—let’s go to
U||   bed. Mr. Claiborne asked us, and he’s the head of this household. It
U||   isn’t anybody’s business what we came for.”
U||   “I’ll slip off my shoes and lie down till Babe ties up the dog in the
U||   morning,” said Ross. “Then we can get away before any of the family is
U||   up.”
U||   Oh, youth—youth—youth, with its rash promises! Worn out with misery the
U||   boys slept heavily. The first sound that either heard in the morning
U||   was Babe hammering upon their bedroom door. They crouched guiltily and
U||   looked into each other’s eyes. “Let pretend we ain’t here and he’ll go
U||   away,” breathed Abner.
U||   But Babe was made of sterner stuff. He rattled the knob. He turned it.
U||   He put in a black face with a grin which divided it from ear to ear.
U||   “Cady say I mus’ call dem fool boys to breakfus’,” he announced. “I
U||   never named you-all dat. Cady, she say dat.”
U||   “Breakfast!” echoed Ross, in a daze.
U||   “Yessuh, breakfus’,” reasserted Babe, coming entirely into the room and
U||   looking curiously about him. “Ain’t you-all done been to bed at all?”
U||   wrapping his arms about his shoulders and shaking with silent ecstasies
U||   of mirth. The boys threw themselves upon him and ejected him.
U||   “Sent up a servant to call us to breakfast,” snarled Abner. “If they’d
U||   only sent their old servant to the door in the first place, all this
U||   wouldn’t ’a’ happened. I’m just that way when I get thrown off the
U||   track. You know how it was when I tried to repeat those things to you—I
U||   had to go clear back to the beginning when I got interrupted.”
U||   “Does that mean that you’re still hanging around here to begin over and
U||   make a call?” asked Ross, darkly. “I won’t go down to breakfast if you
U||   are.”
U||   Abner brightened a little as he saw Ross becoming wordy in his rage. “I
U||   dare you to walk downstairs and say,
U||   ‘‘We-just-dropped-in-to-call-on-Miss-Champe’!” he said.
U||   “I—oh—I—darn it all! there goes the second bell. We may as well trot
U||   down.”
U||   “Don’t leave me, Ross,” pleaded the Jilton boy. “I can’t stay here—and
U||   I can’t go down.”
U||   The tone was hysterical. The boy with freckles took his companion by
U||   the arm without another word and marched him down the stairs. “We may
U||   get a chance yet to call on Champe all by herself out on the porch or
U||   in the arbor before she goes to school,” he suggested, by way of
U||   putting some spine into the black-eyed boy.
U||   An emphatic bell rang when they were half-way down the stairs.
U||   Clutching their hats, they slunk into the dining-room. Even Mr.
U||   Claiborne seemed to notice something unusual in their bearing as they
U||   settled into the chairs assigned to them, and asked them kindly if they
U||   had slept well.
U||   It was plain that Aunt Missouri had been posting him as to her
U||   understanding of the intentions of these young men. The state of
U||   affairs gave an electric hilarity to the atmosphere. Babe travelled
U||   from the sideboard to the table, trembling like chocolate pudding. Cady
U||   insisted on bringing in the cakes herself, and grinned as she whisked
U||   her starched blue skirts in and out of the dining-room. A dimple even
U||   showed itself at the corners of pretty Alicia’s prim little mouth.
U||   Champe giggled, till Ross heard Cady whisper:
U||   “Now you got one dem snickerin’ spells agin. You gwine bust yo’ dress
U||   buttons off in the back ef you don’t mind.”
U||   As the spirits of those about them mounted, the hearts of the two
U||   youths sank—if it was like this among the Claibornes, what would it be
U||   at school and in the world at large when their failure to connect
U||   intention with result became village talk? Ross bit fiercely upon an
U||   unoffending batter-cake, and resolved to make a call single-handed
U||   before he left the house.
U||   They went out of the dining-room, their hats as ever pressed to their
U||   breasts. With no volition of their own, their uncertain young legs
U||   carried them to the porch. The Claiborne family and household followed
U||   like small boys after a circus procession. When the two turned, at bay,
U||   yet with nothing between them and liberty but a hypnotism of their own
U||   suggestion, they saw the black faces of the servants peering over the
U||   family shoulders.
U||   Ross was the boy to have drawn courage from the desperation of their
U||   case, and made some decent if not glorious ending. But at the
U||   psychological moment there came around the corner of the house that
U||   most contemptible figure known to the Southern plantation, a
U||   shirt-boy—a creature who may be described, for the benefit of those not
U||   informed, as a pickaninny clad only in a long, coarse cotton shirt.
U||   While all eyes were fastened upon him this inglorious ambassador bolted
U||   forth his message:
U||   “Yo’ ma say”—his eyes were fixed upon Abner—“ef yo’ don’ come home, she
U||   gwine come after yo’—an’ cut yo’ into inch pieces wid a rawhide when
U||   she git yo’. Dat jest what Miss Hortense say.”
U||   As though such a book as Hints and Helps had never existed, Abner shot
U||   for the gate—he was but a hobbledehoy fascinated with the idea of
U||   playing gentleman. But in Ross there were the makings of a man. For a
U||   few half-hearted paces, under the first impulse of horror, he followed
U||   his deserting chief, the laughter of the family, the unrestrainable
U||   guffaws of the negroes, sounding in the rear. But when Champe’s high,
U||   offensive giggle, topping all the others, insulted his ears, he stopped
U||   dead, wheeled, and ran to the porch faster than he had fled from it.
U||   White as paper, shaking with inexpressible rage, he caught and kissed
U||   the tittering girl, violently, noisily, before them all.
U||   The negroes fled—they dared not trust their feelings; even Alicia
U||   sniggered unobtrusively; Grandfather Claiborne chuckled, and Aunt
U||   Missouri frankly collapsed into her rocking-chair, bubbling with mirth,
U||   crying out:
U||   “Good for you, Ross! Seems you did know how to call on the girls, after
U||   all.”
U||   But Ross, paying no attention, walked swiftly toward the gate. He had
U||   served his novitiate. He would never be afraid again. With cheerful
U||   alacrity he dodged the stones flung after him with friendly, erratic
U||   aim by the girl upon whom, yesterday afternoon, he had come to make a
U||   social call.

U||HOW THE WIDOW WON THE DEACON[73][27]
U||   By William James Lampton ( -1917)
U||   Of course the Widow Stimson never tried to win Deacon Hawkins, nor any
U||   other man, for that matter. A widow doesn’t have to try to win a man;
U||   she wins without trying. Still, the Widow Stimson sometimes wondered
U||   why the deacon was so blind as not to see how her fine farm adjoining
U||   his equally fine place on the outskirts of the town might not be
U||   brought under one management with mutual benefit to both parties at
U||   interest. Which one that management might become was a matter of future
U||   detail. The widow knew how to run a farm successfully, and a large farm
U||   is not much more difficult to run than one of half the size. She had
U||   also had one husband, and knew something more than running a farm
U||   successfully. Of all of which the deacon was perfectly well aware, and
U||   still he had not been moved by the merging spirit of the age to propose
U||   consolidation.
U||   This interesting situation was up for discussion at the Wednesday
U||   afternoon meeting of the Sisters’ Sewing Society.
U||   “For my part,” Sister Susan Spicer, wife of the Methodist minister,
U||   remarked as she took another tuck in a fourteen-year-old girl’s skirt
U||   for a ten-year-old—“for my part, I can’t see why Deacon Hawkins and
U||   Kate Stimson don’t see the error of their ways and depart from them.”
U||   “I rather guess she has,” smiled Sister Poteet, the grocer’s better
U||   half, who had taken an afternoon off from the store in order to be
U||   present.
U||   “Or is willing to,” added Sister Maria Cartridge, a spinster still
U||   possessing faith, hope, and charity, notwithstanding she had been on
U||   the waiting list a long time.
U||   “Really, now,” exclaimed little Sister Green, the doctor’s wife, “do
U||   you think it is the deacon who needs urging?”
U||   “It looks that way to me,” Sister Poteet did not hesitate to affirm.
U||   “Well, I heard Sister Clark say that she had heard him call her ‘Kitty’
U||   one night when they were eating ice-cream at the Mite Society,” Sister
U||   Candish, the druggist’s wife, added to the fund of reliable information
U||   on hand.
U||   “‘Kitty,’ indeed!” protested Sister Spicer. “The idea of anybody
U||   calling Kate Stimson ‘Kitty’! The deacon will talk that way to ’most
U||   any woman, but if she let him say it to her more than once, she must be
U||   getting mighty anxious, I think.”
U||   “Oh,” Sister Candish hastened to explain, “Sister Clark didn’t say she
U||   had heard him say it twice.’”
U||   “Well, I don’t think she heard him say it once,” Sister Spicer asserted
U||   with confidence.
U||   “I don’t know about that,” Sister Poteet argued. “From all I can see
U||   and hear I think Kate Stimson wouldn’t object to ’most anything the
U||   deacon would say to her, knowing as she does that he ain’t going to say
U||   anything he shouldn’t say.”
U||   “And isn’t saying what he should,” added Sister Green, with a sly
U||   snicker, which went around the room softly.
U||   “But as I was saying—” Sister Spicer began, when Sister Poteet, whose
U||   rocker, near the window, commanded a view of the front gate,
U||   interrupted with a warning, “’Sh-’sh.”
U||   “Why shouldn’t I say what I wanted to when—” Sister Spicer began.
U||   “There she comes now,” explained Sister Poteet, “and as I live the
U||   deacon drove her here in his sleigh, and he’s waiting while she comes
U||   in. I wonder what next,” and Sister Poteet, in conjunction with the
U||   entire society, gasped and held their eager breaths, awaiting the
U||   entrance of the subject of conversation.
U||   Sister Spicer went to the front door to let her in, and she was greeted
U||   with the greatest cordiality by everybody.
U||   “We were just talking about you and wondering why you were so late
U||   coming,” cried Sister Poteet. “Now take off your things and make up for
U||   lost time. There’s a pair of pants over there to be cut down to fit
U||   that poor little Snithers boy.”
U||   The excitement and curiosity of the society were almost more than could
U||   be borne, but never a sister let on that she knew the deacon was at the
U||   gate waiting. Indeed, as far as the widow could discover, there was not
U||   the slightest indication that anybody had ever heard there was such a
U||   person as the deacon in existence.
U||   “Oh,” she chirruped, in the liveliest of humors, “you will have to
U||   excuse me for to-day. Deacon Hawkins overtook me on the way here, and
U||   here said I had simply got to go sleigh-riding with him. He’s waiting
U||   out at the gate now.”
U||   “Is that so?” exclaimed the society unanimously, and rushed to the
U||   window to see if it were really true.
U||   “Well, did you ever?” commented Sister Poteet, generally.
U||   “Hardly ever,” laughed the widow, good-naturedly, “and I don’t want to
U||   lose the chance. You know Deacon Hawkins isn’t asking somebody every
U||   day to go sleighing with him. I told him I’d go if he would bring me
U||   around here to let you know what had become of me, and so he did. Now,
U||   good-by, and I’ll be sure to be present at the next meeting. I have to
U||   hurry because he’ll get fidgety.”
U||   The widow ran away like a lively schoolgirl. All the sisters watched
U||   her get into the sleigh with the deacon, and resumed the previous
U||   discussion with greatly increased interest.
U||   But little recked the widow and less recked the deacon. He had bought a
U||   new horse and he wanted the widow’s opinion of it, for the Widow
U||   Stimson was a competent judge of fine horseflesh. If Deacon Hawkins had
U||   one insatiable ambition it was to own a horse which could fling its
U||   heels in the face of the best that Squire Hopkins drove. In his early
U||   manhood the deacon was no deacon by a great deal. But as the years
U||   gathered in behind him he put off most of the frivolities of youth and
U||   held now only to the one of driving a fast horse. No other man in the
U||   county drove anything faster except Squire Hopkins, and him the deacon
U||   had not been able to throw the dust over. The deacon would get good
U||   ones, but somehow never could he find one that the squire didn’t get a
U||   better. The squire had also in the early days beaten the deacon in the
U||   race for a certain pretty girl he dreamed about. But the girl and the
U||   squire had lived happily ever after and the deacon, being a
U||   philosopher, might have forgotten the squire’s superiority had it been
U||   manifested in this one regard only. But in horses, too—that graveled
U||   the deacon.
U||   “How much did you give for him?” was the widow’s first query, after
U||   they had reached a stretch of road that was good going and the deacon
U||   had let him out for a length or two.
U||   “Well, what do you suppose? You’re a judge.”
U||   “More than I would give, I’ll bet a cookie.”
U||   “Not if you was as anxious as I am to show Hopkins that he can’t drive
U||   by everything on the pike.”
U||   “I thought you loved a good horse because he was a good horse,” said
U||   the widow, rather disapprovingly.
U||   “I do, but I could love him a good deal harder if he would stay in
U||   front of Hopkins’s best.”
U||   “Does he know you’ve got this one?”
U||   “Yes, and he’s been blowing round town that he is waiting to pick me up
U||   on the road some day and make my five hundred dollars look like a
U||   pewter quarter.”
U||   “So you gave five hundred dollars for him, did you?” laughed the widow.
U||   “Is it too much?”
U||   “Um-er,” hesitated the widow, glancing along the graceful lines of the
U||   powerful trotter, “I suppose not if you can beat the squire.”
U||   “Right you are,” crowed the deacon, “and I’ll show him a thing or two
U||   in getting over the ground,” he added with swelling pride.
U||   “Well, I hope he won’t be out looking for you to-day, with me in your
U||   sleigh,” said the widow, almost apprehensively, “because, you know,
U||   deacon, I have always wanted you to beat Squire Hopkins.”
U||   The deacon looked at her sharply. There was a softness in her tones
U||   that appealed to him, even if she had not expressed such agreeable
U||   sentiments. Just what the deacon might have said or done after the
U||   impulse had been set going must remain unknown, for at the crucial
U||   moment a sound of militant bells, bells of defiance, jangled up behind
U||   them, disturbing their personal absorption, and they looked around
U||   simultaneously. Behind the bells was the squire in his sleigh drawn by
U||   his fastest stepper, and he was alone, as the deacon was not. The widow
U||   weighed one hundred and sixty pounds, net—which is weighting a horse in
U||   a race rather more than the law allows.
U||   But the deacon never thought of that. Forgetting everything except his
U||   cherished ambition, he braced himself for the contest, took a twist
U||   hold on the lines, sent a sharp, quick call to his horse, and let him
U||   out for all that was in him. The squire followed suit and the deacon.
U||   The road was wide and the snow was worn down smooth. The track couldn’t
U||   have been in better condition. The Hopkins colors were not five rods
U||   behind the Hawkins colors as they got away. For half a mile it was nip
U||   and tuck, the deacon encouraging his horse and the widow encouraging
U||   the deacon, and then the squire began creeping up. The deacon’s horse
U||   was a good one, but he was not accustomed to hauling freight in a race.
U||   A half-mile of it was as much as he could stand, and he weakened under
U||   the strain.
U||   Not handicapped, the squire’s horse forged ahead, and as his nose
U||   pushed up to the dashboard of the deacon’s sleigh, that good man
U||   groaned in agonized disappointment and bitterness of spirit. The widow
U||   was mad all over that Squire Hopkins should take such a mean advantage
U||   of his rival. Why didn’t he wait till another time when the deacon was
U||   alone, as he was? If she had her way she never would, speak to Squire
U||   Hopkins again, nor to his wife, either. But her resentment was not
U||   helping the deacon’s horse to win.
U||   Slowly the squire pulled closer to the front; the deacon’s horse,
U||   realizing what it meant to his master and to him, spurted bravely, but,
U||   struggle as gamely as he might, the odds were too many for him, and he
U||   dropped to the rear. The squire shouted in triumph as he drew past the
U||   deacon, and the dejected Hawkins shrivelled into a heap on the seat,
U||   with only his hands sufficiently alive to hold the lines. He had been
U||   beaten again, humiliated before a woman, and that, too, with the best
U||   horse that he could hope to put against the ever-conquering squire.
U||   Here sank his fondest hopes, here ended his ambition. From this on he
U||   would drive a mule or an automobile. The fruit of his desire had turned
U||   to ashes in his mouth.
U||   But no. What of the widow? She realized, if the deacon did not, that
U||   she, not the squire’s horse, had beaten the deacon’s, and she was ready
U||   to make what atonement she could. As the squire passed ahead of the
U||   deacon she was stirred by a noble resolve. A deep bed of drifted snow
U||   lay close by the side of the road not far in front. It was soft and
U||   safe and she smiled as she looked at it as though waiting for her.
U||   Without a hint of her purpose, or a sign to disturb the deacon in his
U||   final throes, she rose as the sleigh ran near its edge, and with a
U||   spring which had many a time sent her lightly from the ground to the
U||   bare back of a horse in the meadow, she cleared the robes and lit plump
U||   in the drift. The deacon’s horse knew before the deacon did that
U||   something had happened in his favor, and was quick to respond. With his
U||   first jump of relief the deacon suddenly revived, his hopes came fast
U||   again, his blood retingled, he gathered himself, and, cracking his
U||   lines, he shot forward, and three minutes later he had passed the
U||   squire as though he were hitched to the fence. For a quarter of a mile
U||   the squire made heroic efforts to recover his vanished prestige, but
U||   effort was useless, and finally concluding that he was practically left
U||   standing, he veered off from the main road down a farm lane to find
U||   some spot in which to hide the humiliation of his defeat. The deacon,
U||   still going at a clipping gait, had one eye over his shoulder as wary
U||   drivers always have on such occasions, and when he saw the squire was
U||   off the track he slowed down and jogged along with the apparent
U||   intention of continuing indefinitely. Presently an idea struck him, and
U||   he looked around for the widow. She was not where he had seen her last.
U||   Where was she? In the enthusiasm of victory he had forgotten her. He
U||   was so dejected at the moment she had leaped that he did not realize
U||   what she had done, and two minutes later he was so elated that, shame
U||   on him! he did not care. With her, all was lost; without her, all was
U||   won, and the deacon’s greatest ambition was to win. But now, with
U||   victory perched on his horse-collar, success his at last, he thought of
U||   the widow, and he did care. He cared so much that he almost threw his
U||   horse off his feet by the abrupt turn he gave him, and back down the
U||   pike he flew as if a legion of squires were after him.
U||   He did not know what injury she might have sustained; She might have
U||   been seriously hurt, if not actually killed. And why? Simply to make it
U||   possible for him to win. The deacon shivered as he thought of it, and
U||   urged his horse to greater speed. The squire, down the lane, saw him
U||   whizzing along and accepted it profanely as an exhibition for his
U||   especial benefit. The deacon now had forgotten the squire as he had
U||   only so shortly before forgotten the widow. Two hundred yards from the
U||   drift into which she had jumped there was a turn in the road, where
U||   some trees shut off the sight, and the deacon’s anxiety increased
U||   momentarily until he reached this point. From here he could see ahead,
U||   and down there in the middle of the road stood the widow waving her
U||   shawl as a banner of triumph, though she could only guess at results.
U||   The deacon came on with a rush, and pulled up alongside of her in a
U||   condition of nervousness he didn’t think possible to him.
U||   “Hooray! hooray!” shouted the widow, tossing her shawl into the air.
U||   “You beat him. I know you did. Didn’t you? I saw you pulling ahead at
U||   the turn yonder. Where is he and his old plug?”
U||   “Oh, bother take him and his horse and the race and everything. Are you
U||   hurt?” gasped the deacon, jumping out, but mindful to keep the lines in
U||   his hand. “Are you hurt?” he repeated, anxiously, though she looked
U||   anything but a hurt woman.
U||   “If I am,” she chirped, cheerily, “I’m not hurt half as bad as I would
U||   have been if the squire had beat you, deacon. Now don’t you worry about
U||   me. Let’s hurry back to town so the squire won’t get another chance,
U||   with no place for me to jump.”
U||   And the deacon? Well, well, with the lines in the crook of his elbow
U||   the deacon held out his arms to the widow and——. The sisters at the
U||   next meeting of the Sewing Society were unanimously of the opinion that
U||   any woman who would risk her life like that for a husband was mighty
U||   anxious.

U||GIDEON[75][28]
U||   By Wells Hastings (1878- )
U||   “An’ de next’ frawg dat houn’ pup seen, he pass him by wide.”
U||   The house, which had hung upon every word, roared with laughter, and
U||   shook with a storming volley of applause. Gideon bowed to right and to
U||   left, low, grinning, assured comedy obeisances; but as the laughter and
U||   applause grew he shook his head, and signaled quietly for the drop. He
U||   had answered many encores, and he was an instinctive artist. It was
U||   part of the fuel of his vanity that his audience had never yet had
U||   enough of him. Dramatic judgment, as well as dramatic sense of
U||   delivery, was native to him, qualities which the shrewd Felix Stuhk,
U||   his manager and exultant discoverer, recognized and wisely trusted in.
U||   Off stage Gideon was watched over like a child and a delicate
U||   investment, but once behind the footlights he was allowed to go his own
U||   triumphant gait.
U||   It was small wonder that Stuhk deemed himself one of the cleverest
U||   managers in the business; that his narrow, blue-shaven face was
U||   continually chiseled in smiles of complacent self-congratulation. He
U||   was rapidly becoming rich, and there were bright prospects of even
U||   greater triumphs, with proportionately greater reward. He had made
U||   Gideon a national character, a headliner, a star of the first magnitude
U||   in the firmament of the vaudeville theater, and all in six short
U||   months. Or, at any rate, he had helped to make him all this; he had
U||   booked him well and given him his opportunity. To be sure, Gideon had
U||   done the rest; Stuhk was as ready as any one to do credit to Gideon’s
U||   ability. Still, after all, he, Stuhk, was the discoverer, the
U||   theatrical Columbus who had had the courage and the vision.
U||   A now-hallowed attack of tonsilitis had driven him to Florida, where
U||   presently Gideon had been employed to beguile his convalescence, and
U||   guide him over the intricate shallows of that long lagoon known as the
U||   Indian River in search of various fish. On days when fish had been
U||   reluctant Gideon had been lured into conversation, and gradually into
U||   narrative and the relation of what had appeared to Gideon as humorous
U||   and entertaining; and finally Felix, the vague idea growing big within
U||   him, had one day persuaded his boatman to dance upon the boards of a
U||   long pier where they had made fast for lunch. There, with all the
U||   sudden glory of crystallization, the vague idea took definite form and
U||   became the great inspiration of Stuhk’s career.
U||   Gideon had grown to be to vaudeville much what Uncle Remus is to
U||   literature: there was virtue in his very simplicity. His artistry
U||   itself was native and natural. He loved a good story, and he told it
U||   from his own sense of the gleeful morsel upon his tongue as no training
U||   could have made him. He always enjoyed his story and himself in the
U||   telling. Tales never lost their savor, no matter how often repeated;
U||   age was powerless to dim the humor of the thing, and as he had shouted
U||   and gurgled and laughed over the fun of things when all alone, or
U||   holding forth among the men and women and little children of his color,
U||   so he shouted and gurgled and broke from sonorous chuckles to musical,
U||   falsetto mirth when he fronted the sweeping tiers of faces across the
U||   intoxicating glare of the footlights. He had that rare power of
U||   transmitting something of his own enjoyments. When Gideon was on the
U||   stage, Stuhk used to enjoy peeping out at the intent, smiling faces of
U||   the audience, where men and women and children, hardened theater-goers
U||   and folk fresh from the country, sat with moving lips and faces lit
U||   with an eager interest and sympathy for the black man strutting in
U||   loose-footed vivacity before them.
U||   “He’s simply unique,” he boasted to wondering local managers—“unique,
U||   and it took me to find him. There he was, a little black gold-mine, and
U||   all of ’em passed him by until I came. Some eye? What? I guess you’ll
U||   admit you have to hand it some to your Uncle Felix. If that coon’s
U||   health holds out, we’ll have all the money there is in the mint.”
U||   That was Felix’s real anxiety—“If his health holds out.” Gideon’s
U||   health was watched over as if he had been an ailing prince. His
U||   bubbling vivacity was the foundation upon which his charm and his
U||   success were built. Stuhk became a sort of vicarious neurotic,
U||   eternally searching for symptoms in his protégé; Gideon’s tongue,
U||   Gideon’s liver, Gideon’s heart were matters to him of an unfailing and
U||   anxious interest. And of late—of course it might be imagination —Gideon
U||   had shown a little physical falling off. He ate a bit less, he had
U||   begun to move in a restless way, and, worst of all, he laughed less
U||   frequently.
U||   As a matter of fact, there was ground for Stuhk’s apprehension. It was
U||   not all a matter of managerial imagination: Gideon was less himself.
U||   Physically there was nothing the matter with him; he could have passed
U||   his rigid insurance scrutiny as easily as he had done months before,
U||   when his life and health had been insured for a sum that made good copy
U||   for his press-agent. He was sound in every organ, but there was
U||   something lacking in general tone. Gideon felt it himself, and was
U||   certain that a “misery,” that embracing indisposition of his race, was
U||   creeping upon him. He had been fed well, too well; he was growing rich,
U||   too rich; he had all the praise, all the flattery that his enormous
U||   appetite for approval desired, and too much of it. White men sought him
U||   out and made much of him; white women talked to him about his career;
U||   and wherever he went, women of color—black girls, brown girls, yellow
U||   girls—wrote him of their admiration, whispered, when he would listen,
U||   of their passion and hero-worship. “City niggers” bowed down before
U||   him; the high gallery was always packed with them. Musk-scented notes
U||   scrawled upon barbaric, “high-toned” stationery poured in upon him.
U||   Even a few white women, to his horror and embarrassment, had written
U||   him of love, letters which he straightway destroyed. His sense of his
U||   position was strong in him; he was proud of it. There might be “folks
U||   outer their haids,” but he had the sense to remember. For months he had
U||   lived in a heaven of gratified vanity, but at last his appetite had
U||   begun to falter. He was sated; his soul longed to wipe a spiritual
U||   mouth on the back of a spiritual hand, and have done. His face, now
U||   that the curtain was down and he was leaving the stage, was doleful,
U||   almost sullen.
U||   Stuhk met him anxiously in the wings, and walked with him to his
U||   dressing-room. He felt suddenly very weary of Stuhk.
U||   “Nothing the matter, Gideon, is there? Not feeling sick or anything?”
U||   “No, Misteh Stuhk; no, seh. Jes don’ feel extry pert, that’s all.”
U||   “But what is it—anything bothering you?”
U||   Gideon sat gloomily before his mirror.
U||   “Misteh Stuhk,” he said at last, “I been steddyin’ it oveh, and I about
U||   come to the delusion that I needs a good po’k-chop. Seems foolish, I
U||   know, but it do’ seem as if a good po’k-chop, fried jes right, would
U||   he’p consid’able to disumpate this misery feelin’ that’s crawlin’ and
U||   creepin’ round my sperit.”
U||   Stuhk laughed.
U||   “Pork-chop, eh? Is that the best you can think of? I know what you
U||   mean, though. I’ve thought for some time that you were getting a little
U||   overtrained. What you need is—let me see—yes, a nice bottle of wine.
U||   That’s the ticket; it will ease things up and won’t do you any harm.
U||   I’ll go, with you. Ever had any champagne, Gideon?”
U||   Gideon struggled for politeness.
U||   “Yes, seh, I’s had champagne, and it’s a nice kind of lickeh sho
U||   enough; but, Misteh Stuhk, seh, I don’ want any of them high-tone
U||   drinks to-night, an’ ef yo’ don’ mind, I’d rather amble off ’lone, or
U||   mebbe eat that po’k-chop with some otheh cullud man, ef I kin fin’ one
U||   that ain’ one of them no-’count Carolina niggers. Do you s’pose yo’
U||   could let me have a little money to-night, Misteh Stuhk?”
U||   Stuhk thought rapidly. Gideon had certainly worked hard, and he was not
U||   dissipated. If he wanted to roam the town by himself, there was no harm
U||   in it. The sullenness still showed in the black face; Heaven knew what
U||   he might do if he suddenly began to balk. Stuhk thought it wise to
U||   consent gracefully.
U||   “Good!” he said. “Fly to it. How much do you want? A hundred?”
U||   “How much is coming to me?”
U||   “About a thousand, Gideon.”
U||   “Well, I’d moughty like five hun’red of it, ef that’s ’greeable to
U||   yo’.”
U||   Felix whistled.
U||   “Five hundred? Pork-chops must be coming high. You don’t want to carry
U||   all that money around, do you?”
U||   Gideon did not answer; he looked very gloomy.
U||   Stuhk hastened to cheer him.
U||   “Of course you can have anything you want. Wait a minute, and I will
U||   get it for you.
U||   “I’ll bet that coon’s going to buy himself a ring or something,” he
U||   reflected as he went in search of the local manager and Gideon’s money.
U||   But Stuhk was wrong. Gideon had no intention of buying himself a ring.
U||   For the matter of that, he had several that were amply satisfactory.
U||   They had size and sparkle and luster, all the diamond brilliance that
U||   rings need to have; and for none of them had he paid much over five
U||   dollars. He was amply supplied with jewelry in which he felt perfect
U||   satisfaction. His present want was positive, if nebulous; he desired a
U||   fortune in his pocket, bulky, tangible evidence of his miraculous
U||   success. Ever since Stuhk had found him, life had had an unreal quality
U||   for him. His Monte Cristo wealth was too much like a fabulous,
U||   dream-found treasure, money that could not be spent without danger of
U||   awakening. And he had dropped into the habit of storing it about him,
U||   so that in any pocket into which he plunged his hand he might find a
U||   roll of crisp evidence of reality. He liked his bills to be of all
U||   denominations, and some so large as exquisitely to stagger imagination,
U||   others charming by their number and crispness—the dignified, orange
U||   paper of a man of assured position and wealth-crackling greenbacks the
U||   design of which tinged the whole with actuality. He was specially
U||   partial to engravings of President Lincoln, the particular savior and
U||   patron of his race. This five hundred dollars he was adding to an
U||   unreckoned sum of about two thousand, merely as extra fortification
U||   against a growing sense of gloom. He wished to brace his flagging
U||   spirits with the gay wine of possession, and he was glad, when the
U||   money came, that it was in an elastic-bound roll, so bulky that it was
U||   pleasantly uncomfortable in his pocket as he left his manager.
U||   As he turned into the brilliantly lighted street from the somber
U||   alleyway of the stage entrance, he paused for a moment to glance at his
U||   own name, in three-foot letters of red, before the doors of the
U||   theater. He could read, and the large block type always pleased him.
U||   “THIS WEEK: GIDEON.” That was all. None of the fulsome praise, the
U||   superlative, necessary definition given to lesser performers. He had
U||   been, he remembered, “GIDEON, America’s Foremost Native Comedian,” a
U||   title that was at once boast and challenge. That necessity was now
U||   past, for he was a national character; any explanatory qualification
U||   would have been an insult to the public intelligence. To the world he
U||   was just “Gideon”; that was enough. It gave him pleasure, as he
U||   sauntered along, to see the announcement repeated on window cards and
U||   hoardings.
U||   Presently he came to a window before which he paused in delighted
U||   wonder. It was not a large window; to the casual eye of the passer-by
U||   there was little to draw attention. By day it lighted the fractional
U||   floor space of a little stationer, who supplemented a slim business by
U||   a sub-agency for railroad and steamship lines; but to-night this window
U||   seemed the framework of a marvel of coincidence. On the broad, dusty
U||   sill inside were propped two cards: the one on the left was his own
U||   red-lettered announcement for the week; the one at the right—oh, world
U||   of wonders!—was a photogravure of that exact stretch of the inner coast
U||   of Florida which Gideon knew best, which was home.
U||   There it was, the Indian River, rippling idly in full sunlight,
U||   palmettos leaning over the water, palmettos standing as irregular
U||   sentries along the low, reeflike island which stretched away out of the
U||   picture. There was the gigantic, lonely pine he knew well, and, yes—he
U||   could just make it out—there was his own ramshackle little pier, which
U||   stretched in undulating fashion, like a long-legged, wading
U||   caterpillar, from the abrupt shore-line of eroded coquina into deep
U||   water.
U||   He thought at first that this picture of his home was some new and
U||   delicate device put forth by his press-agent. His name on one side of a
U||   window, his birthplace upon the other—what could be more tastefully
U||   appropriate? Therefore, as he spelled out the reading-matter beneath
U||   the photogravure, he was sharply disappointed. It read:
U||   Spend this winter in balmy Florida.
U||   Come to the Land of Perpetual Sunshine.
U||   Golf, tennis, driving, shooting, boating, fishing, all of the best.
U||   There was more, but he had no heart for it; he was disappointed and
U||   puzzled. This picture had, after all, nothing to do with him. It was a
U||   chance, and yet, what a strange chance! It troubled and upset him. His
U||   black, round-featured face took on deep wrinkles of perplexity. The
U||   “misery” which had hung darkly on his horizon for weeks engulfed him
U||   without warning. But in the very bitterness of his melancholy he knew
U||   at last his disease. It was not champagne or recreation that he needed,
U||   not even a “po’k-chop,” although his desire for it had been a symptom,
U||   a groping for a too homeopathic remedy: he was homesick.
U||   Easy, childish tears came into his eyes, and ran over his shining
U||   cheeks. He shivered forlornly with a sudden sense of cold, and absently
U||   clutched at the lapels of his gorgeous, fur-lined ulster.
U||   Then in abrupt reaction he laughed aloud, so that the shrill, musical
U||   falsetto startled the passers-by, and in another moment a little
U||   semicircle of the curious watched spellbound as a black man,
U||   exquisitely appareled, danced in wild, loose grace before the dull
U||   background of a somewhat grimy and apparently vacant window. A newsboy
U||   recognized him.
U||   He heard his name being passed from mouth to mouth, and came partly to
U||   his senses. He stopped dancing, and grinned at them.
U||   “Say, you are Gideon, ain’t you?” his discoverer demanded, with a sort
U||   of reverent audacity.
U||   “Yaas, seh,” said Gideon; “that’s me. Yo’ shu got it right.” He broke
U||   into a joyous peal of laughter—the laughter that had made him famous,
U||   and bowed deeply before him. “Gideon—posi-tive-ly his las’
U||   puffawmunce.” Turning, he dashed for a passing trolley, and, still
U||   laughing, swung aboard.
U||   He was naturally honest. In a land of easy morality his friends had
U||   accounted him something of a paragon; nor had Stuhk ever had anything
U||   but praise for him. But now he crushed aside the ethics of his intent
U||   without a single troubled thought. Running away has always been
U||   inherent in the negro. He gave one regretful thought to the gorgeous
U||   wardrobe he was leaving behind him; but he dared not return for it.
U||   Stuhk might have taken it into his head to go back to their rooms. He
U||   must content himself with the reflection that he was at that moment
U||   wearing his best.
U||   The trolley seemed too slow for him, and, as always happened nowadays,
U||   he was recognized; he heard his name whispered, and was aware of the
U||   admiring glances of the curious. Even popularity had its drawbacks. He
U||   got down in front of a big hotel and chose a taxicab from the waiting
U||   rank, exhorting the driver to make his best speed to the station.
U||   Leaning back in the soft depths of the cab, he savored his
U||   independence, cheered already by the swaying, lurching speed. At the
U||   station he tipped the driver in lordly fashion, very much pleased with
U||   himself and anxious to give pleasure. Only the sternest prudence and an
U||   unconquerable awe of uniform had kept him from tossing bills to the
U||   various traffic policemen who had seemed to smile upon his hurry.
U||   No through train left for hours; but after the first disappointment of
U||   momentary check, he decided that he was more pleased than otherwise. It
U||   would save embarrassment. He was going South, where his color would be
U||   more considered than his reputation, and on the little local he chose
U||   there was a “Jim Crow” car—one, that is, specially set aside for those
U||   of his race. That it proved crowded and full of smoke did not trouble
U||   him at all, nor did the admiring pleasantries which the splendor of his
U||   apparel immediately called forth. No one knew him; indeed, he was
U||   naturally enough mistaken for a prosperous gambler, a not unflattering
U||   supposition. In the yard, after the train pulled out, he saw his
U||   private car under a glaring arc light, and grinned to see it left
U||   behind.
U||   He spent the night pleasantly in a noisy game of high-low-jack, and the
U||   next morning slept more soundly than he had slept for weeks, hunched
U||   upon a wooden bench in the boxlike station of a North Carolina
U||   junction. The express would have brought him to Jacksonville in
U||   twenty-four hours; the journey, as he took it, boarding any local that
U||   happened to be going south, and leaving it for meals or sometimes for
U||   sleep or often as the whim possessed him, filled five happy days. There
U||   he took a night train, and dozed from Jacksonville until a little north
U||   of New Smyrna.
U||   He awoke to find it broad daylight, and the car half empty. The train
U||   was on a siding, with news of a freight wreck ahead. Gideon stretched
U||   himself, and looked out of the window, and emotion seized him. For all
U||   his journey the South had seemed to welcome him, but here at last was
U||   the country he knew. He went out upon the platform and threw back his
U||   head, sniffing the soft breeze, heavy with the mysterious thrill of
U||   unplowed acres, the wondrous existence of primordial jungle, where life
U||   has rioted unceasingly above unceasing decay. It was dry with the fine
U||   dust of waste places, and wet with the warm mists of slumbering swamps;
U||   it seemed to Gideon to tremble with the songs of birds, the dry murmur
U||   of palm leaves, and the almost inaudible whisper of the gray moss that
U||   festooned the live-oaks.
U||   “Um-m-m,” he murmured, apostrophizing it, “yo’ ’s the right kind o’
U||   breeze, yo’ is. Yo’-all’s healthy.” Still sniffing, he climbed down to
U||   the dusty road-bed.
U||   The negroes who had ridden with him were sprawled about him on the
U||   ground; one of them lay sleeping, face up, in the sunlight. The train
U||   had evidently been there for some time, and there were no signs of an
U||   immediate departure. He bought some oranges of a little, bowlegged
U||   black boy, and sat down on a log to eat them and to give up his mind to
U||   enjoyment. The sun was hot upon him, and his thoughts were vague and
U||   drowsy. He was glad that he was alive, glad to be back once more among
U||   familiar scenes. Down the length of the train he saw white passengers
U||   from the Pullmans restlessly pacing up and down, getting into their
U||   cars and out of them, consulting watches, attaching themselves with
U||   gesticulatory expostulation to various officials; but their impatience
U||   found no echo in his thought. What was the hurry? There was plenty of
U||   time. It was sufficient to have come to his own land; the actual walls
U||   of home could wait. The delay was pleasant, with its opportunity for
U||   drowsy sunning, its relief from the grimy monotony of travel. He
U||   glanced at the orange-colored “Jim Crow” with distaste, and
U||   inspiration, dawning slowly upon him, swept all other thought before it
U||   in its great and growing glory.
U||   A brakeman passed, and Gideon leaped to his feet and pursued him.
U||   “Misteh, how long yo’-all reckon this train goin’ to be?”
U||   “About an hour.”
U||   The question had been a mere matter of form. Gideon had made up his
U||   mind, and if he had been told that they started in five minutes he
U||   would not have changed it. He climbed back into the car for his coat
U||   and his hat, and then almost furtively stole down the steps again and
U||   slipped quietly into the palmetto scrub.
U||   “’Most made the mistake of ma life,” he chuckled, “stickin’ to that ol’
U||   train foheveh. ’Tisn’t the right way at, all foh Gideon to come home.”
U||   The river was not far away. He could catch the dancing blue of it from
U||   time to time in ragged vista, and for this beacon he steered directly.
U||   His coat was heavy on his arm, his thin patent-leather ties pinched and
U||   burned and demanded detours around swampy places, but he was happy.
U||   As he went along, his plan perfected itself. He would get into loose
U||   shoes again, old ones, if money could buy them, and old clothes, too.
U||   The bull-briers snatching at his tailored splendor suggested that.
U||   He laughed when the Florida partridge, a small quail, whirred up from
U||   under his feet; he paused to exchange affectionate mockery with red
U||   squirrels; and once, even when he was brought up suddenly to a familiar
U||   and ominous, dry reverberation, the small, crisp sound of the rolling
U||   drums of death, he did not look about him for some instrument of
U||   destruction, as at any other time he would have done, but instead
U||   peered cautiously over the log before him, and spoke in tolerant
U||   admonition:
U||   “Now, Misteh Rattlesnake, yo’ jes min’ yo’ own business. Nobody’s goin’
U||   step on yo’, ner go triflin’ roun’ yo’ in no way whatsomeveh. Yo’ jes
U||   lay there in the sun an’ git ’s fat ’s yo’ please. Don’ yo’ tu’n yo’
U||   weeked li’l’ eyes on Gideon. He’s jes goin’ ’long home, an’ ain’
U||   lookin’ foh no muss.”
U||   He came presently to the water, and, as luck would have it, to a little
U||   group of negro cabins, where he was able to buy old clothes and, after
U||   much dickering, a long and somewhat leaky rowboat rigged out with a
U||   tattered leg-of-mutton sail. This he provisioned with a jug of water, a
U||   starch box full of white corn-meal, and a wide strip of lean razorback
U||   bacon.
U||   As he pushed out from shore and set his sail to the small breeze that
U||   blew down from the north, an absolute contentment possessed him. The
U||   idle waters of the lagoon, lying without tide or current in eternal
U||   indolence, rippled and sparkled in breeze and sunlight with a merry
U||   surface activity, and seemed to lap the leaky little boat more swiftly
U||   on its way. Mosquito Inlet opened broadly before him, and skirting the
U||   end of Merritt’s Island he came at last into that longest lagoon, with
U||   which he was most familiar, the Indian River. Here the wind died down
U||   to a mere breath, which barely kept his boat in motion; but he made no
U||   attempt to row. As long as he moved at all, he was satisfied. He was
U||   living the fulfilment of his dreams in exile, lounging in the stern in
U||   the ancient clothes he had purchased, his feet stretched comfortably
U||   before him in their broken shoes, one foot upon a thwart, the other
U||   hanging overside so laxly that occasional ripples lapped the run-over
U||   heel. From time to time he scanned shore and river for familiar points
U||   of interest—some remembered snag that showed the tip of one gnarled
