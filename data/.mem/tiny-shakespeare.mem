U||First Citizen:
U||Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
U||All:
U||Speak, speak.
U||First Citizen:
U||You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
U||All:
U||Resolved. resolved.
U||First Citizen:
U||First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
U||All:
U||We know't, we know't.
U||First Citizen:
U||Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
U||Is't a verdict?
U||All:
U||No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
U||Second Citizen:
U||One word, good citizens.
U||First Citizen:
U||We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
U||What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
U||would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
U||wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
U||but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
U||afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
U||inventory to particularise their abundance; our
U||sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
U||our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
U||speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
U||All:
U||Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Consider you what services he has done for his country?
U||First Citizen:
U||Very well; and could be content to give him good
U||report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Nay, but speak not maliciously.
U||First Citizen:
U||I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
U||it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
U||content to say it was for his country he did it to
U||please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
U||is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
U||Second Citizen:
U||What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
U||vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
U||First Citizen:
U||If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
U||he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
U||What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
U||is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
U||All:
U||Come, come.
U||First Citizen:
U||Soft! who comes here?
U||Second Citizen:
U||Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
U||the people.
U||First Citizen:
U||He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
U||MENENIUS:
U||What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
U||With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
U||First Citizen:
U||Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
U||had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
U||which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
U||suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
U||have strong arms too.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
U||Will you undo yourselves?
U||First Citizen:
U||We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I tell you, friends, most charitable care
U||Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
U||Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
U||Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
U||Against the Roman state, whose course will on
U||The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
U||Of more strong link asunder than can ever
U||Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
U||The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
U||Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
U||You are transported by calamity
U||Thither where more attends you, and you slander
U||The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
U||When you curse them as enemies.
U||First Citizen:
U||Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
U||yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
U||crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
U||support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
U||established against the rich, and provide more
U||piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
U||the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
U||there's all the love they bear us.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Either you must
U||Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
U||Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
U||A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
U||But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
U||To stale 't a little more.
U||First Citizen:
U||Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
U||fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
U||you, deliver.
U||MENENIUS:
U||There was a time when all the body's members
U||Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
U||That only like a gulf it did remain
U||I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
U||Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
U||Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
U||Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
U||And, mutually participate, did minister
U||Unto the appetite and affection common
U||Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
U||First Citizen:
U||Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
U||Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
U||For, look you, I may make the belly smile
U||As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
U||To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
U||That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
U||As you malign our senators for that
U||They are not such as you.
U||First Citizen:
U||Your belly's answer? What!
U||The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
U||The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
U||Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
U||With other muniments and petty helps
U||In this our fabric, if that they--
U||MENENIUS:
U||What then?
U||'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
U||First Citizen:
U||Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
U||Who is the sink o' the body,--
U||MENENIUS:
U||Well, what then?
U||First Citizen:
U||The former agents, if they did complain,
U||What could the belly answer?
U||MENENIUS:
U||I will tell you
U||If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
U||Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
U||First Citizen:
U||Ye're long about it.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Note me this, good friend;
U||Your most grave belly was deliberate,
U||Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
U||'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
U||'That I receive the general food at first,
U||Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
U||Because I am the store-house and the shop
U||Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
U||I send it through the rivers of your blood,
U||Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
U||And, through the cranks and offices of man,
U||The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
U||From me receive that natural competency
U||Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
U||You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
U||First Citizen:
U||Ay, sir; well, well.
U||MENENIUS:
U||'Though all at once cannot
U||See what I do deliver out to each,
U||Yet I can make my audit up, that all
U||From me do back receive the flour of all,
U||And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
U||First Citizen:
U||It was an answer: how apply you this?
U||MENENIUS:
U||The senators of Rome are this good belly,
U||And you the mutinous members; for examine
U||Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
U||Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
U||No public benefit which you receive
U||But it proceeds or comes from them to you
U||And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
U||You, the great toe of this assembly?
U||First Citizen:
U||I the great toe! why the great toe?
U||MENENIUS:
U||For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
U||Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
U||Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
U||Lead'st first to win some vantage.
U||But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
U||Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
U||The one side must have bale.
U||Hail, noble Marcius!
U||MARCIUS:
U||Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
U||That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
U||Make yourselves scabs?
U||First Citizen:
U||We have ever your good word.
U||MARCIUS:
U||He that will give good words to thee will flatter
U||Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
U||That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
U||The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
U||Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
U||Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
U||Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
U||Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
U||To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
U||And curse that justice did it.
U||Who deserves greatness
U||Deserves your hate; and your affections are
U||A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
U||Which would increase his evil. He that depends
U||Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
U||And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
U||With every minute you do change a mind,
U||And call him noble that was now your hate,
U||Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
U||That in these several places of the city
U||You cry against the noble senate, who,
U||Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
U||Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
U||MENENIUS:
U||For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
U||The city is well stored.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Hang 'em! They say!
U||They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
U||What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
U||Who thrives and who declines; side factions
U||and give out
U||Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
U||And feebling such as stand not in their liking
U||Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
U||grain enough!
U||Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
U||And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
U||With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
U||As I could pick my lance.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
U||For though abundantly they lack discretion,
U||Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
U||What says the other troop?
U||MARCIUS:
U||They are dissolved: hang 'em!
U||They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
U||That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
U||That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
U||Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
U||They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
U||And a petition granted them, a strange one--
U||To break the heart of generosity,
U||And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
U||As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
U||Shouting their emulation.
U||MENENIUS:
U||What is granted them?
U||MARCIUS:
U||Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
U||Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
U||Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
U||The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
U||Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
U||Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
U||For insurrection's arguing.
U||MENENIUS:
U||This is strange.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Go, get you home, you fragments!
U||Messenger:
U||Where's Caius Marcius?
U||MARCIUS:
U||Here: what's the matter?
U||Messenger:
U||The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
U||MARCIUS:
U||I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
U||Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
U||First Senator:
U||Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
U||The Volsces are in arms.
U||MARCIUS:
U||They have a leader,
U||Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
U||I sin in envying his nobility,
U||And were I any thing but what I am,
U||I would wish me only he.
U||COMINIUS:
U||You have fought together.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
U||Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
U||Only my wars with him: he is a lion
U||That I am proud to hunt.
U||First Senator:
U||Then, worthy Marcius,
U||Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
U||COMINIUS:
U||It is your former promise.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Sir, it is;
U||And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
U||Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
U||What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
U||TITUS:
U||No, Caius Marcius;
U||I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
U||Ere stay behind this business.
U||MENENIUS:
U||O, true-bred!
U||First Senator:
U||Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
U||Our greatest friends attend us.
U||TITUS:
U||COMINIUS:
U||Noble Marcius!
U||First Senator:
U||MARCIUS:
U||Nay, let them follow:
U||The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
U||To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
U||Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
U||BRUTUS:
U||He has no equal.
U||SICINIUS:
U||When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
U||BRUTUS:
U||Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
U||SICINIUS:
U||Nay. but his taunts.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Be-mock the modest moon.
U||BRUTUS:
U||The present wars devour him: he is grown
U||Too proud to be so valiant.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Such a nature,
U||Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
U||Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
U||His insolence can brook to be commanded
U||Under Cominius.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Fame, at the which he aims,
U||In whom already he's well graced, can not
U||Better be held nor more attain'd than by
U||A place below the first: for what miscarries
U||Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
U||To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
U||Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
U||Had borne the business!'
U||SICINIUS:
U||Besides, if things go well,
U||Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
U||Of his demerits rob Cominius.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Come:
U||Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
U||Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
U||To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
U||In aught he merit not.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Let's hence, and hear
U||How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
U||More than his singularity, he goes
U||Upon this present action.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Lets along.
U||First Senator:
U||So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
U||That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
U||And know how we proceed.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Is it not yours?
U||What ever have been thought on in this state,
U||That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
U||Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
U||Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
U||I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
U||'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
U||Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
U||The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
U||Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
U||Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
U||And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
U||These three lead on this preparation
U||Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
U||Consider of it.'
U||First Senator:
U||Our army's in the field
U||We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
U||To answer us.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Nor did you think it folly
U||To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
U||They needs must show themselves; which
U||in the hatching,
U||It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
U||We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
U||To take in many towns ere almost Rome
U||Should know we were afoot.
U||Second Senator:
U||Noble Aufidius,
U||Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
U||Let us alone to guard Corioli:
U||If they set down before 's, for the remove
U||Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
U||They've not prepared for us.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||O, doubt not that;
U||I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
U||Some parcels of their power are forth already,
U||And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
U||If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
U||'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
U||Till one can do no more.
U||All:
U||The gods assist you!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||And keep your honours safe!
U||First Senator:
U||Farewell.
U||Second Senator:
U||Farewell.
U||All:
U||Farewell.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
U||more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
U||should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
U||won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
U||he would show most love. When yet he was but
U||tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
U||youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
U||for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
U||sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
U||how honour would become such a person. that it was
U||no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
U||renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
U||danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
U||war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
U||bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
U||more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
U||than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
U||man.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Then his good report should have been my son; I
U||therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
U||sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
U||alike and none less dear than thine and my good
U||Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
U||country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
U||Gentlewoman:
U||Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Indeed, you shall not.
U||Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
U||See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
U||As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
U||Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
U||'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
U||Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
U||With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
U||Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
U||Or all or lose his hire.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
U||Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
U||When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
U||Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
U||At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
U||We are fit to bid her welcome.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
U||And tread upon his neck.
U||VALERIA:
U||My ladies both, good day to you.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Sweet madam.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||I am glad to see your ladyship.
U||VALERIA:
U||How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
U||What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
U||faith. How does your little son?
U||VIRGILIA:
U||I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
U||look upon his school-master.
U||VALERIA:
U||O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
U||very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
U||Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
U||confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
U||butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
U||again; and after it again; and over and over he
U||comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
U||fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
U||teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
U||it!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||One on 's father's moods.
U||VALERIA:
U||Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||A crack, madam.
U||VALERIA:
U||Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
U||the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
U||VALERIA:
U||Not out of doors!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||She shall, she shall.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
U||threshold till my lord return from the wars.
U||VALERIA:
U||Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
U||you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
U||my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Why, I pray you?
U||VIRGILIA:
U||'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
U||VALERIA:
U||You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
U||the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
U||Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
U||were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
U||pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
U||VALERIA:
U||In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
U||excellent news of your husband.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||O, good madam, there can be none yet.
U||VALERIA:
U||Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
U||him last night.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||Indeed, madam?
U||VALERIA:
U||In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
U||Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
U||whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
U||our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
U||down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
U||prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
U||on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
U||thing hereafter.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
U||disease our better mirth.
U||VALERIA:
U||In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
U||Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
U||solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
U||you much mirth.
U||VALERIA:
U||Well, then, farewell.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
U||LARTIUS:
U||My horse to yours, no.
U||MARCIUS:
U||'Tis done.
U||LARTIUS:
U||Agreed.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Say, has our general met the enemy?
U||Messenger:
U||They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
U||LARTIUS:
U||So, the good horse is mine.
U||MARCIUS:
U||I'll buy him of you.
U||LARTIUS:
U||No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
U||For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
U||MARCIUS:
U||How far off lie these armies?
U||Messenger:
U||Within this mile and half.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
U||Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
U||That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
U||To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
U||Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
U||First Senator:
U||No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
U||That's lesser than a little.
U||Hark! our drums
U||Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
U||Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
U||Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
U||They'll open of themselves.
U||Hark you. far off!
U||There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
U||Amongst your cloven army.
U||MARCIUS:
U||O, they are at it!
U||LARTIUS:
U||Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
U||MARCIUS:
U||They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
U||Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
U||With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
U||brave Titus:
U||They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
U||Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
U||He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
U||And he shall feel mine edge.
U||MARCIUS:
U||All the contagion of the south light on you,
U||You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
U||Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
U||Further than seen and one infect another
U||Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
U||That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
U||From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
U||All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
U||With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
U||Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
U||And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
U||If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
U||As they us to our trenches followed.
U||So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
U||'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
U||Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
U||First Soldier:
U||Fool-hardiness; not I.
U||Second Soldier:
U||Nor I.
U||First Soldier:
U||See, they have shut him in.
U||All:
U||To the pot, I warrant him.
U||LARTIUS:
U||What is become of Marcius?
U||All:
U||Slain, sir, doubtless.
U||First Soldier:
U||Following the fliers at the very heels,
U||With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
U||Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
U||To answer all the city.
U||LARTIUS:
U||O noble fellow!
U||Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
U||And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
U||A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
U||Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
U||Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
U||Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
U||The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
U||Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
U||Were feverous and did tremble.
U||First Soldier:
U||Look, sir.
U||LARTIUS:
U||O,'tis Marcius!
U||Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
U||First Roman:
U||This will I carry to Rome.
U||Second Roman:
U||And I this.
U||Third Roman:
U||A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
U||MARCIUS:
U||See here these movers that do prize their hours
U||At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
U||Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
U||Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
U||Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
U||And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
U||There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
U||Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
U||Convenient numbers to make good the city;
U||Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
U||To help Cominius.
U||LARTIUS:
U||Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
U||Thy exercise hath been too violent for
U||A second course of fight.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Sir, praise me not;
U||My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
U||The blood I drop is rather physical
U||Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
U||I will appear, and fight.
U||LARTIUS:
U||Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
U||Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
U||Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
U||Prosperity be thy page!
U||MARCIUS:
U||Thy friend no less
U||Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
U||LARTIUS:
U||Thou worthiest Marcius!
U||Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
U||Call thither all the officers o' the town,
U||Where they shall know our mind: away!
U||COMINIUS:
U||Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
U||we are come off
U||Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
U||Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
U||We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
U||By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
U||The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
U||Lead their successes as we wish our own,
U||That both our powers, with smiling
U||fronts encountering,
U||May give you thankful sacrifice.
U||Thy news?
U||Messenger:
U||The citizens of Corioli have issued,
U||And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
U||I saw our party to their trenches driven,
U||And then I came away.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Though thou speak'st truth,
U||Methinks thou speak'st not well.
U||How long is't since?
U||Messenger:
U||Above an hour, my lord.
U||COMINIUS:
U||'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
U||How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
U||And bring thy news so late?
U||Messenger:
U||Spies of the Volsces
U||Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
U||Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
U||Half an hour since brought my report.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Who's yonder,
U||That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
U||He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
U||Before-time seen him thus.
U||MARCIUS:
U||COMINIUS:
U||The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
U||More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
U||From every meaner man.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Come I too late?
U||COMINIUS:
U||Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
U||But mantled in your own.
U||MARCIUS:
U||O, let me clip ye
U||In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
U||As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
U||And tapers burn'd to bedward!
U||COMINIUS:
U||Flower of warriors,
U||How is it with Titus Lartius?
U||MARCIUS:
U||As with a man busied about decrees:
U||Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
U||Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
U||Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
U||Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
U||To let him slip at will.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Where is that slave
U||Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
U||Where is he? call him hither.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Let him alone;
U||He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
U||The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
U||The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
U||From rascals worse than they.
U||COMINIUS:
U||But how prevail'd you?
U||MARCIUS:
U||Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
U||Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
U||If not, why cease you till you are so?
U||COMINIUS:
U||Marcius,
U||We have at disadvantage fought and did
U||Retire to win our purpose.
U||MARCIUS:
U||How lies their battle? know you on which side
U||They have placed their men of trust?
U||COMINIUS:
U||As I guess, Marcius,
U||Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
U||Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
U||Their very heart of hope.
U||MARCIUS:
U||I do beseech you,
U||By all the battles wherein we have fought,
U||By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
U||We have made to endure friends, that you directly
U||Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
U||And that you not delay the present, but,
U||Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
U||We prove this very hour.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Though I could wish
U||You were conducted to a gentle bath
U||And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
U||Deny your asking: take your choice of those
U||That best can aid your action.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Those are they
U||That most are willing. If any such be here--
U||As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
U||Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
U||Lesser his person than an ill report;
U||If any think brave death outweighs bad life
U||And that his country's dearer than himself;
U||Let him alone, or so many so minded,
U||Wave thus, to express his disposition,
U||And follow Marcius.
U||O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
U||If these shows be not outward, which of you
U||But is four Volsces? none of you but is
U||Able to bear against the great Aufidius
U||A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
U||Though thanks to all, must I select
U||from all: the rest
U||Shall bear the business in some other fight,
U||As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
U||And four shall quickly draw out my command,
U||Which men are best inclined.
U||COMINIUS:
U||March on, my fellows:
U||Make good this ostentation, and you shall
U||Divide in all with us.
U||LARTIUS:
U||So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
U||As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
U||Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
U||For a short holding: if we lose the field,
U||We cannot keep the town.
U||Lieutenant:
U||Fear not our care, sir.
U||LARTIUS:
U||Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
U||Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.
U||MARCIUS:
U||I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
U||Worse than a promise-breaker.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||We hate alike:
U||Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
U||More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Let the first budger die the other's slave,
U||And the gods doom him after!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||If I fly, Marcius,
U||Holloa me like a hare.
U||MARCIUS:
U||Within these three hours, Tullus,
U||Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
U||And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
U||Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
U||Wrench up thy power to the highest.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Wert thou the Hector
U||That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
U||Thou shouldst not scape me here.
U||Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
U||In your condemned seconds.
U||COMINIUS:
U||If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
U||Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
U||Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
U||Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
U||I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
U||And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
U||dull tribunes,
U||That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
U||Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
U||Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
U||Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
U||Having fully dined before.
U||LARTIUS:
U||O general,
U||Here is the steed, we the caparison:
U||Hadst thou beheld--
U||MARCIUS:
U||Pray now, no more: my mother,
U||Who has a charter to extol her blood,
U||When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
U||As you have done; that's what I can; induced
U||As you have been; that's for my country:
U||He that has but effected his good will
U||Hath overta'en mine act.
U||COMINIUS:
U||You shall not be
U||The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
U||The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
U||Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
U||To hide your doings; and to silence that,
U||Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
U||Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
U||In sign of what you are, not to reward
U||What you have done--before our army hear me.
U||MARCIUS:
U||I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
U||To hear themselves remember'd.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Should they not,
U||Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
U||And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
U||Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
U||The treasure in this field achieved and city,
U||We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
U||Before the common distribution, at
U||Your only choice.
U||MARCIUS:
U||I thank you, general;
U||But cannot make my heart consent to take
U||A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
U||And stand upon my common part with those
U||That have beheld the doing.
U||MARCIUS:
U||May these same instruments, which you profane,
U||Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
U||I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
U||Made all of false-faced soothing!
U||When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
U||Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
U||No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
U||My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
U||Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
U||You shout me forth
U||In acclamations hyperbolical;
U||As if I loved my little should be dieted
U||In praises sauced with lies.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Too modest are you;
U||More cruel to your good report than grateful
U||To us that give you truly: by your patience,
U||If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
U||Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
U||Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
U||As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
U||Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
U||My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
U||With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
U||For what he did before Corioli, call him,
U||With all the applause and clamour of the host,
U||CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
U||The addition nobly ever!
U||All:
U||Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I will go wash;
U||And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
U||Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
U||I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
U||To undercrest your good addition
U||To the fairness of my power.
U||COMINIUS:
U||So, to our tent;
U||Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
U||To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
U||Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
U||The best, with whom we may articulate,
U||For their own good and ours.
U||LARTIUS:
U||I shall, my lord.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
U||Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
U||Of my lord general.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I sometime lay here in Corioli
U||At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
U||He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
U||But then Aufidius was within my view,
U||And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
U||To give my poor host freedom.
U||COMINIUS:
U||O, well begg'd!
U||Were he the butcher of my son, he should
U||Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
U||LARTIUS:
U||Marcius, his name?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||By Jupiter! forgot.
U||I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
U||Have we no wine here?
U||COMINIUS:
U||Go we to our tent:
U||The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
U||It should be look'd to: come.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||The town is ta'en!
U||First Soldier:
U||'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Condition!
U||I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
U||Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
U||What good condition can a treaty find
U||I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
U||I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
U||And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
U||As often as we eat. By the elements,
U||If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
U||He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
U||Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
U||I thought to crush him in an equal force,
U||True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
U||Or wrath or craft may get him.
U||First Soldier:
U||He's the devil.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
U||With only suffering stain by him; for him
U||Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
U||Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
U||The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
U||Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
U||Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
U||My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
U||At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
U||Against the hospitable canon, would I
U||Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
U||Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
U||Be hostages for Rome.
U||First Soldier:
U||Will not you go?
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
U||'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
U||How the world goes, that to the pace of it
U||I may spur on my journey.
U||First Soldier:
U||I shall, sir.
U||MENENIUS:
U||The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Good or bad?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
U||love not Marcius.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Pray you, who does the wolf love?
U||SICINIUS:
U||The lamb.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
U||noble Marcius.
U||BRUTUS:
U||He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
U||MENENIUS:
U||He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
U||are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
U||Both:
U||Well, sir.
U||MENENIUS:
U||In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
U||have not in abundance?
U||BRUTUS:
U||He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Especially in pride.
U||BRUTUS:
U||And topping all others in boasting.
U||MENENIUS:
U||This is strange now: do you two know how you are
U||censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
U||right-hand file? do you?
U||Both:
U||Why, how are we censured?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
U||Both:
U||Well, well, sir, well.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
U||occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
U||give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
U||your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
U||pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
U||being proud?
U||BRUTUS:
U||We do it not alone, sir.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
U||are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
U||single: your abilities are too infant-like for
U||doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
U||could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
U||and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
U||O that you could!
U||BRUTUS:
U||What then, sir?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
U||proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
U||any in Rome.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Menenius, you are known well enough too.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
U||loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
U||Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
U||favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
U||upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
U||with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
U||of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
U||malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
U||you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
U||you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
U||crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
U||delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
U||compound with the major part of your syllables: and
U||though I must be content to bear with those that say
U||you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
U||tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
U||the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
U||well enough too? what barm can your bisson
U||conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
U||known well enough too?
U||BRUTUS:
U||Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
U||MENENIUS:
U||You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
U||are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
U||wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
U||cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
U||and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
U||second day of audience. When you are hearing a
U||matter between party and party, if you chance to be
U||pinched with the colic, you make faces like
U||mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
U||patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
U||dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
U||by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
U||cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
U||a pair of strange ones.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Come, come, you are well understood to be a
U||perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
U||bencher in the Capitol.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
U||encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
U||you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
U||wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
U||so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
U||cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
U||saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
U||who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
U||since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
U||best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
U||your worships: more of your conversation would
U||infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
U||plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
U||How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
U||were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
U||your eyes so fast?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
U||the love of Juno, let's go.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Ha! Marcius coming home!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
U||approbation.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
U||Marcius coming home!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Nay,'tis true.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
U||another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
U||at home for you.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
U||me!
U||VIRGILIA:
U||Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
U||MENENIUS:
U||A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
U||years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
U||the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
U||Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
U||of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
U||not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||O, no, no, no.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
U||MENENIUS:
U||So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
U||victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
U||with the oaken garland.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
U||Aufidius got off.
U||MENENIUS:
U||And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
U||an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
U||fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
U||that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
U||has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
U||son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
U||action outdone his former deeds doubly
U||VALERIA:
U||In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
U||true purchasing.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||The gods grant them true!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||True! pow, wow.
U||MENENIUS:
U||True! I'll be sworn they are true.
U||Where is he wounded?
U||God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
U||home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
U||large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
U||stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
U||Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
U||MENENIUS:
U||One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
U||nine that I know.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
U||wounds upon him.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
U||Hark! the trumpets.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
U||carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
U||Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
U||Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
U||Herald:
U||Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
U||Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
U||With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
U||In honour follows Coriolanus.
U||Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
U||All:
U||Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||No more of this; it does offend my heart:
U||Pray now, no more.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Look, sir, your mother!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||O,
U||You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
U||For my prosperity!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Nay, my good soldier, up;
U||My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
U||By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
U||What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
U||But O, thy wife!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||My gracious silence, hail!
U||Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
U||That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
U||Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
U||And mothers that lack sons.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Now, the gods crown thee!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||And live you yet?
U||O my sweet lady, pardon.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
U||And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
U||MENENIUS:
U||A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
U||And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
U||A curse begin at very root on's heart,
U||That is not glad to see thee! You are three
U||That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
U||We have some old crab-trees here
U||at home that will not
U||Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
U||We call a nettle but a nettle and
U||The faults of fools but folly.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Ever right.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Menenius ever, ever.
U||Herald:
U||Give way there, and go on!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||I have lived
U||To see inherited my very wishes
U||And the buildings of my fancy: only
U||There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
U||Our Rome will cast upon thee.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Know, good mother,
U||I had rather be their servant in my way,
U||Than sway with them in theirs.
U||COMINIUS:
U||On, to the Capitol!
U||BRUTUS:
U||All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
U||Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
U||Into a rapture lets her baby cry
U||While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
U||Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
U||Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
U||Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
U||With variable complexions, all agreeing
U||In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
U||Do press among the popular throngs and puff
U||To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
U||Commit the war of white and damask in
U||Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
U||Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
U||As if that whatsoever god who leads him
U||Were slily crept into his human powers
U||And gave him graceful posture.
U||SICINIUS:
U||On the sudden,
U||I warrant him consul.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Then our office may,
U||During his power, go sleep.
U||SICINIUS:
U||He cannot temperately transport his honours
U||From where he should begin and end, but will
U||Lose those he hath won.
U||BRUTUS:
U||In that there's comfort.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Doubt not
U||The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
U||Upon their ancient malice will forget
U||With the least cause these his new honours, which
U||That he will give them make I as little question
U||As he is proud to do't.
U||BRUTUS:
U||I heard him swear,
U||Were he to stand for consul, never would he
U||Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
U||The napless vesture of humility;
U||Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
U||To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
U||SICINIUS:
U||'Tis right.
U||BRUTUS:
U||It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
U||Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
U||And the desire of the nobles.
U||SICINIUS:
U||I wish no better
U||Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
U||In execution.
U||BRUTUS:
U||'Tis most like he will.
U||SICINIUS:
U||It shall be to him then as our good wills,
U||A sure destruction.
U||BRUTUS:
U||So it must fall out
U||To him or our authorities. For an end,
U||We must suggest the people in what hatred
U||He still hath held them; that to's power he would
U||Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
U||Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
U||In human action and capacity,
U||Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
U||Than camels in the war, who have their provand
U||Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
U||For sinking under them.
U||SICINIUS:
U||This, as you say, suggested
U||At some time when his soaring insolence
U||Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
U||If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
U||As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
U||To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
U||Shall darken him for ever.
U||BRUTUS:
U||What's the matter?
U||Messenger:
U||You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
U||That Marcius shall be consul:
U||I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
U||The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
U||Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
U||Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
U||As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
U||A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
U||I never saw the like.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Let's to the Capitol;
U||And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
U||But hearts for the event.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Have with you.
U||First Officer:
U||Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
U||for consulships?
U||Second Officer:
U||Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
U||Coriolanus will carry it.
U||First Officer:
U||That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
U||loves not the common people.
U||Second Officer:
U||Faith, there had been many great men that have
U||flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
U||be many that they have loved, they know not
U||wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
U||they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
U||Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
U||him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
U||disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
U||them plainly see't.
U||First Officer:
U||If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
U||he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
U||good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
U||devotion than can render it him; and leaves
U||nothing undone that may fully discover him their
U||opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
U||displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
U||dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
U||Second Officer:
U||He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
U||ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
U||having been supple and courteous to the people,
U||bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
U||an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
U||planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
U||in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
U||silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
U||ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
U||malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
U||reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
U||First Officer:
U||No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
U||are coming.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Having determined of the Volsces and
U||To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
U||As the main point of this our after-meeting,
U||To gratify his noble service that
U||Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
U||please you,
U||Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
U||The present consul, and last general
U||In our well-found successes, to report
U||A little of that worthy work perform'd
U||By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
U||We met here both to thank and to remember
U||With honours like himself.
U||First Senator:
U||Speak, good Cominius:
U||Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
U||Rather our state's defective for requital
U||Than we to stretch it out.
U||Masters o' the people,
U||We do request your kindest ears, and after,
U||Your loving motion toward the common body,
U||To yield what passes here.
U||SICINIUS:
U||We are convented
U||Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
U||Inclinable to honour and advance
U||The theme of our assembly.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Which the rather
U||We shall be blest to do, if he remember
U||A kinder value of the people than
U||He hath hereto prized them at.
U||MENENIUS:
U||That's off, that's off;
U||I would you rather had been silent. Please you
U||To hear Cominius speak?
U||BRUTUS:
U||Most willingly;
U||But yet my caution was more pertinent
U||Than the rebuke you give it.
U||MENENIUS:
U||He loves your people
U||But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
U||Worthy Cominius, speak.
U||Nay, keep your place.
U||First Senator:
U||Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
U||What you have nobly done.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Your horror's pardon:
U||I had rather have my wounds to heal again
U||Than hear say how I got them.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Sir, I hope
U||My words disbench'd you not.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||No, sir: yet oft,
U||When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
U||You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
U||your people,
U||I love them as they weigh.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Pray now, sit down.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
U||When the alarum were struck than idly sit
U||To hear my nothings monster'd.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Masters of the people,
U||Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
U||That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
U||He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
U||Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
U||COMINIUS:
U||I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
U||Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
U||That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
U||Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
U||The man I speak of cannot in the world
U||Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
U||When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
U||Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
U||Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
U||When with his Amazonian chin he drove
U||The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
U||An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
U||Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
U||And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
U||When he might act the woman in the scene,
U||He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
U||Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
U||Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
U||And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
U||He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
U||Before and in Corioli, let me say,
U||I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
U||And by his rare example made the coward
U||Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
U||A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
U||And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
U||Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
U||He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
U||Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
U||The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
U||With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
U||And with a sudden reinforcement struck
U||Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
U||When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
U||His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
U||Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
U||And to the battle came he; where he did
U||Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
U||'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
U||Both field and city ours, he never stood
U||To ease his breast with panting.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Worthy man!
U||First Senator:
U||He cannot but with measure fit the honours
U||Which we devise him.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Our spoils he kick'd at,
U||And look'd upon things precious as they were
U||The common muck of the world: he covets less
U||Than misery itself would give; rewards
U||His deeds with doing them, and is content
U||To spend the time to end it.
U||MENENIUS:
U||He's right noble:
U||Let him be call'd for.
U||First Senator:
U||Call Coriolanus.
U||Officer:
U||He doth appear.
U||MENENIUS:
U||The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
U||To make thee consul.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I do owe them still
U||My life and services.
U||MENENIUS:
U||It then remains
U||That you do speak to the people.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I do beseech you,
U||Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
U||Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
U||For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
U||That I may pass this doing.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Sir, the people
U||Must have their voices; neither will they bate
U||One jot of ceremony.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Put them not to't:
U||Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
U||Take to you, as your predecessors have,
U||Your honour with your form.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||It is apart
U||That I shall blush in acting, and might well
U||Be taken from the people.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Mark you that?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
U||Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
U||As if I had received them for the hire
U||Of their breath only!
U||MENENIUS:
U||Do not stand upon't.
U||We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
U||Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
U||Wish we all joy and honour.
U||Senators:
U||To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
U||BRUTUS:
U||You see how he intends to use the people.
U||SICINIUS:
U||May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
U||As if he did contemn what he requested
U||Should be in them to give.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Come, we'll inform them
U||Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
U||I know, they do attend us.
U||First Citizen:
U||Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
U||Second Citizen:
U||We may, sir, if we will.
U||Third Citizen:
U||We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
U||power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
U||his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
U||tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
U||he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
U||our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
U||monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
U||were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
U||which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
U||monstrous members.
U||First Citizen:
U||And to make us no better thought of, a little help
U||will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
U||himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
U||Third Citizen:
U||We have been called so of many; not that our heads
U||are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
U||but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
U||truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
U||one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
U||and their consent of one direct way should be at
U||once to all the points o' the compass.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
U||fly?
U||Third Citizen:
U||Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
U||will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
U||if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Why that way?
U||Third Citizen:
U||To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
U||melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
U||for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
U||Second Citizen:
U||You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
U||Third Citizen:
U||Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
U||that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
U||say, if he would incline to the people, there was
U||never a worthier man.
U||Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
U||behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
U||come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
U||by threes. He's to make his requests by
U||particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
U||honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
U||tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
U||you shall go by him.
U||All:
U||Content, content.
U||MENENIUS:
U||O sir, you are not right: have you not known
U||The worthiest men have done't?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||What must I say?
U||'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
U||My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
U||I got them in my country's service, when
U||Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
U||From the noise of our own drums.'
U||MENENIUS:
U||O me, the gods!
U||You must not speak of that: you must desire them
U||To think upon you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Think upon me! hang 'em!
U||I would they would forget me, like the virtues
U||Which our divines lose by 'em.
U||MENENIUS:
U||You'll mar all:
U||I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
U||In wholesome manner.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Bid them wash their faces
U||And keep their teeth clean.
U||So, here comes a brace.
U||You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
U||Third Citizen:
U||We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Mine own desert.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Your own desert!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Ay, but not mine own desire.
U||Third Citizen:
U||How not your own desire?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
U||poor with begging.
U||Third Citizen:
U||You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
U||gain by you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
U||First Citizen:
U||The price is to ask it kindly.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
U||show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
U||good voice, sir; what say you?
U||Second Citizen:
U||You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
U||begged. I have your alms: adieu.
U||Third Citizen:
U||But this is something odd.
U||Second Citizen:
U||An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
U||voices that I may be consul, I have here the
U||customary gown.
U||Fourth Citizen:
U||You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
U||have not deserved nobly.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Your enigma?
U||Fourth Citizen:
U||You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
U||been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
U||the common people.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||You should account me the more virtuous that I have
U||not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
U||sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
U||estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
U||gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
U||rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
U||the insinuating nod and be off to them most
U||counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
U||bewitchment of some popular man and give it
U||bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
U||I may be consul.
U||Fifth Citizen:
U||We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
U||you our voices heartily.
U||Fourth Citizen:
U||You have received many wounds for your country.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
U||will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
U||Both Citizens:
U||The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Most sweet voices!
U||Better it is to die, better to starve,
U||Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
U||Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
U||To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
U||Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
U||What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
U||The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
U||And mountainous error be too highly heapt
U||For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
U||Let the high office and the honour go
U||To one that would do thus. I am half through;
U||The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
U||Here come more voices.
U||Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
U||Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
U||Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
U||I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
U||Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
U||Indeed I would be consul.
U||Sixth Citizen:
U||He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
U||man's voice.
U||Seventh Citizen:
U||Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
U||and make him good friend to the people!
U||All Citizens:
U||Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Worthy voices!
U||MENENIUS:
U||You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
U||Endue you with the people's voice: remains
U||That, in the official marks invested, you
U||Anon do meet the senate.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Is this done?
U||SICINIUS:
U||The custom of request you have discharged:
U||The people do admit you, and are summon'd
U||To meet anon, upon your approbation.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Where? at the senate-house?
U||SICINIUS:
U||There, Coriolanus.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||May I change these garments?
U||SICINIUS:
U||You may, sir.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
U||Repair to the senate-house.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I'll keep you company. Will you along?
U||BRUTUS:
U||We stay here for the people.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Fare you well.
U||He has it now, and by his looks methink
U||'Tis warm at 's heart.
U||BRUTUS:
U||With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
U||will you dismiss the people?
U||SICINIUS:
U||How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
U||First Citizen:
U||He has our voices, sir.
U||BRUTUS:
U||We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
U||He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
U||Third Citizen:
U||Certainly
U||He flouted us downright.
U||First Citizen:
U||No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
U||He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
U||His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Why, so he did, I am sure.
U||Citizens:
U||No, no; no man saw 'em.
U||Third Citizen:
U||He said he had wounds, which he could show
U||in private;
U||And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
U||'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
U||But by your voices, will not so permit me;
U||Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
U||Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
U||Your most sweet voices: now you have left
U||your voices,
U||I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
U||SICINIUS:
U||Why either were you ignorant to see't,
U||Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
U||To yield your voices?
U||BRUTUS:
U||Could you not have told him
U||As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
U||But was a petty servant to the state,
U||He was your enemy, ever spake against
U||Your liberties and the charters that you bear
U||I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
U||A place of potency and sway o' the state,
U||If he should still malignantly remain
U||Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
U||Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
U||That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
U||Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
U||Would think upon you for your voices and
U||Translate his malice towards you into love,
U||Standing your friendly lord.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Thus to have said,
U||As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
U||And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
U||Either his gracious promise, which you might,
U||As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
U||Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
U||Which easily endures not article
U||Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
U||You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
U||And pass'd him unelected.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Did you perceive
U||He did solicit you in free contempt
U||When he did need your loves, and do you think
U||That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
U||When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
U||No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
U||Against the rectorship of judgment?
U||SICINIUS:
U||Have you
U||Ere now denied the asker? and now again
U||Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
U||Your sued-for tongues?
U||Third Citizen:
U||He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
U||Second Citizen:
U||And will deny him:
U||I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
U||First Citizen:
U||I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
U||They have chose a consul that will from them take
U||Their liberties; make them of no more voice
U||Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
U||As therefore kept to do so.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Let them assemble,
U||And on a safer judgment all revoke
U||Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
U||And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
U||With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
U||How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
U||Thinking upon his services, took from you
U||The apprehension of his present portance,
U||Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
U||After the inveterate hate he bears you.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Lay
U||A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
U||No impediment between, but that you must
U||Cast your election on him.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Say, you chose him
U||More after our commandment than as guided
U||By your own true affections, and that your minds,
U||Preoccupied with what you rather must do
U||Than what you should, made you against the grain
U||To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
U||How youngly he began to serve his country,
U||How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
U||The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
U||That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
U||Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
U||Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
U||That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
U||And  
U||Twice being  
U||Was his great ancestor.
U||SICINIUS:
U||One thus descended,
U||That hath beside well in his person wrought
U||To be set high in place, we did commend
U||To your remembrances: but you have found,
U||Scaling his present bearing with his past,
U||That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
U||Your sudden approbation.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Say, you ne'er had done't--
U||Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
U||And presently, when you have drawn your number,
U||Repair to the Capitol.
U||All:
U||We will so: almost all
U||Repent in their election.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Let them go on;
U||This mutiny were better put in hazard,
U||Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
U||If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
U||With their refusal, both observe and answer
U||The vantage of his anger.
U||SICINIUS:
U||To the Capitol, come:
U||We will be there before the stream o' the people;
U||And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
U||Which we have goaded onward.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
U||LARTIUS:
U||He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
U||Our swifter composition.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
U||Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
U||Upon's again.
U||COMINIUS:
U||They are worn, lord consul, so,
U||That we shall hardly in our ages see
U||Their banners wave again.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Saw you Aufidius?
U||LARTIUS:
U||On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
U||Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
U||Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Spoke he of me?
U||LARTIUS:
U||He did, my lord.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||How? what?
U||LARTIUS:
U||How often he had met you, sword to sword;
U||That of all things upon the earth he hated
U||Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
U||To hopeless restitution, so he might
U||Be call'd your vanquisher.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||At Antium lives he?
U||LARTIUS:
U||At Antium.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
U||To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
U||Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
U||The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
U||For they do prank them in authority,
U||Against all noble sufferance.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Pass no further.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Ha! what is that?
U||BRUTUS:
U||It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||What makes this change?
U||MENENIUS:
U||The matter?
U||COMINIUS:
U||Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
U||BRUTUS:
U||Cominius, no.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Have I had children's voices?
U||First Senator:
U||Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
U||BRUTUS:
U||The people are incensed against him.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Stop,
U||Or all will fall in broil.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Are these your herd?
U||Must these have voices, that can yield them now
U||And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
U||your offices?
U||You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
U||Have you not set them on?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Be calm, be calm.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
U||To curb the will of the nobility:
U||Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
U||Nor ever will be ruled.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Call't not a plot:
U||The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
U||When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
U||Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
U||Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Why, this was known before.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Not to them all.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Have you inform'd them sithence?
U||BRUTUS:
U||How! I inform them!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||You are like to do such business.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Not unlike,
U||Each way, to better yours.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
U||Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
U||Your fellow tribune.
U||SICINIUS:
U||You show too much of that
U||For which the people stir: if you will pass
U||To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
U||Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
U||Or never be so noble as a consul,
U||Nor yoke with him for tribune.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Let's be calm.
U||COMINIUS:
U||The people are abused; set on. This paltering
U||Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
U||Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
U||I' the plain way of his merit.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Tell me of corn!
U||This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
U||MENENIUS:
U||Not now, not now.
U||First Senator:
U||Not in this heat, sir, now.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
U||I crave their pardons:
U||For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
U||Regard me as I do not flatter, and
U||Therein behold themselves: I say again,
U||In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
U||The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
U||Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
U||and scatter'd,
U||By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
U||Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
U||Which they have given to beggars.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Well, no more.
U||First Senator:
U||No more words, we beseech you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||How! no more!
U||As for my country I have shed my blood,
U||Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
U||Coin words till their decay against those measles,
U||Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
U||The very way to catch them.
U||BRUTUS:
U||You speak o' the people,
U||As if you were a god to punish, not
U||A man of their infirmity.
U||SICINIUS:
U||'Twere well
U||We let the people know't.
U||MENENIUS:
U||What, what? his choler?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Choler!
U||Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
U||By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
U||SICINIUS:
U||It is a mind
U||That shall remain a poison where it is,
U||Not poison any further.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Shall remain!
U||Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
U||His absolute 'shall'?
U||COMINIUS:
U||'Twas from the canon.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||'Shall'!
U||O good but most unwise patricians! why,
U||You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
U||Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
U||That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
U||The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
U||To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
U||And make your channel his? If he have power
U||Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
U||Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
U||Be not as common fools; if you are not,
U||Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
U||If they be senators: and they are no less,
U||When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
U||Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
U||And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
U||His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
U||Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
U||It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
U||To know, when two authorities are up,
U||Neither supreme, how soon confusion
U||May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
U||The one by the other.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Well, on to the market-place.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
U||The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
U||Sometime in Greece,--
U||MENENIUS:
U||Well, well, no more of that.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Though there the people had more absolute power,
U||I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
U||The ruin of the state.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Why, shall the people give
U||One that speaks thus their voice?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I'll give my reasons,
U||More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
U||Was not our recompense, resting well assured
U||That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
U||Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
U||They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
U||Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
U||Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
U||Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
U||Which they have often made against the senate,
U||All cause unborn, could never be the motive
U||Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
U||How shall this bisson multitude digest
U||The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
U||What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
U||We are the greater poll, and in true fear
U||They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
U||The nature of our seats and make the rabble
U||Call our cares fears; which will in time
U||Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
U||The crows to peck the eagles.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Come, enough.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Enough, with over-measure.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||No, take more:
U||What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
U||Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
U||Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
U||Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
U||Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
U||Of general ignorance,--it must omit
U||Real necessities, and give way the while
U||To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
U||it follows,
U||Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
U||You that will be less fearful than discreet,
U||That love the fundamental part of state
U||More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
U||A noble life before a long, and wish
U||To jump a body with a dangerous physic
U||That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
U||The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
U||The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
U||Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
U||Of that integrity which should become't,
U||Not having the power to do the good it would,
U||For the in which doth control't.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Has said enough.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
U||As traitors do.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
U||What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
U||On whom depending, their obedience fails
U||To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
U||When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
U||Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
U||Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
U||And throw their power i' the dust.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Manifest treason!
U||SICINIUS:
U||This a consul? no.
U||BRUTUS:
U||The aediles, ho!
U||Let him be apprehended.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Go, call the people:
U||in whose name myself
U||Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
U||A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
U||And follow to thine answer.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Hence, old goat!
U||Senators, &C:
U||We'll surety him.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Aged sir, hands off.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
U||Out of thy garments.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Help, ye citizens!
U||MENENIUS:
U||On both sides more respect.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Here's he that would take from you all your power.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Seize him, AEdiles!
U||Citizens:
U||Down with him! down with him!
U||Senators, &C:
U||Weapons, weapons, weapons!
U||'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
U||'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
U||'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
U||MENENIUS:
U||What is about to be? I am out of breath;
U||Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
U||To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
U||Speak, good Sicinius.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Hear me, people; peace!
U||Citizens:
U||Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
U||SICINIUS:
U||You are at point to lose your liberties:
U||Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
U||Whom late you have named for consul.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Fie, fie, fie!
U||This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
U||First Senator:
U||To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
U||SICINIUS:
U||What is the city but the people?
U||Citizens:
U||True,
U||The people are the city.
U||BRUTUS:
U||By the consent of all, we were establish'd
U||The people's magistrates.
U||Citizens:
U||You so remain.
U||MENENIUS:
U||And so are like to do.
U||COMINIUS:
U||That is the way to lay the city flat;
U||To bring the roof to the foundation,
U||And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
U||In heaps and piles of ruin.
U||SICINIUS:
U||This deserves death.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Or let us stand to our authority,
U||Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
U||Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
U||We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
U||Of present death.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Therefore lay hold of him;
U||Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
U||Into destruction cast him.
U||BRUTUS:
U||AEdiles, seize him!
U||Citizens:
U||Yield, Marcius, yield!
U||MENENIUS:
U||Hear me one word;
U||Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
U||AEdile:
U||Peace, peace!
U||MENENIUS:
U||BRUTUS:
U||Sir, those cold ways,
U||That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
U||Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
U||And bear him to the rock.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||No, I'll die here.
U||There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
U||Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Lay hands upon him.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Help Marcius, help,
U||You that be noble; help him, young and old!
U||Citizens:
U||Down with him, down with him!
U||MENENIUS:
U||Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
U||All will be naught else.
U||Second Senator:
U||Get you gone.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Stand fast;
U||We have as many friends as enemies.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Sham it be put to that?
U||First Senator:
U||The gods forbid!
U||I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
U||Leave us to cure this cause.
U||MENENIUS:
U||For 'tis a sore upon us,
U||You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Come, sir, along with us.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I would they were barbarians--as they are,
U||Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
U||Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
U||MENENIUS:
U||Be gone;
U||Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
U||One time will owe another.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||On fair ground
U||I could beat forty of them.
U||COMINIUS:
U||I could myself
U||Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
U||two tribunes:
U||But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
U||And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
U||Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
U||Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
U||Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
U||What they are used to bear.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Pray you, be gone:
U||I'll try whether my old wit be in request
U||With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
U||With cloth of any colour.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Nay, come away.
U||A Patrician:
U||This man has marr'd his fortune.
U||MENENIUS:
U||His nature is too noble for the world:
U||He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
U||Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
U||What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
U||And, being angry, does forget that ever
U||He heard the name of death.
U||Here's goodly work!
U||Second Patrician:
U||I would they were abed!
U||MENENIUS:
U||I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
U||Could he not speak 'em fair?
U||SICINIUS:
U||Where is this viper
U||That would depopulate the city and
U||Be every man himself?
U||MENENIUS:
U||You worthy tribunes,--
U||SICINIUS:
U||He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
U||With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
U||And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
U||Than the severity of the public power
U||Which he so sets at nought.
U||First Citizen:
U||He shall well know
U||The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
U||And we their hands.
U||Citizens:
U||He shall, sure on't.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Sir, sir,--
U||SICINIUS:
U||Peace!
U||MENENIUS:
U||Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
U||With modest warrant.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Sir, how comes't that you
U||Have holp to make this rescue?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Hear me speak:
U||As I do know the consul's worthiness,
U||So can I name his faults,--
U||SICINIUS:
U||Consul! what consul?
U||MENENIUS:
U||The consul Coriolanus.
U||BRUTUS:
U||He consul!
U||Citizens:
U||No, no, no, no, no.
U||MENENIUS:
U||If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
U||I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
U||The which shall turn you to no further harm
U||Than so much loss of time.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Speak briefly then;
U||For we are peremptory to dispatch
U||This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
U||Were but one danger, and to keep him here
U||Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
U||He dies to-night.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Now the good gods forbid
U||That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
U||Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
U||In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
U||Should now eat up her own!
U||SICINIUS:
U||He's a disease that must be cut away.
U||MENENIUS:
U||O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
U||Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
U||What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
U||Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
U||Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
U||By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
U||And what is left, to lose it by his country,
U||Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
U||A brand to the end o' the world.
U||SICINIUS:
U||This is clean kam.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Merely awry: when he did love his country,
U||It honour'd him.
U||MENENIUS:
U||The service of the foot
U||Being once gangrened, is not then respected
U||For what before it was.
U||BRUTUS:
U||We'll hear no more.
U||Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
U||Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
U||Spread further.
U||MENENIUS:
U||One word more, one word.
U||This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
U||The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
U||Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
U||Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
U||And sack great Rome with Romans.
U||BRUTUS:
U||If it were so,--
U||SICINIUS:
U||What do ye talk?
U||Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
U||Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
U||Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
U||In bolted language; meal and bran together
U||He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
U||I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
U||Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
U||In peace, to his utmost peril.
U||First Senator:
U||Noble tribunes,
U||It is the humane way: the other course
U||Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
U||Unknown to the beginning.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Noble Menenius,
U||Be you then as the people's officer.
U||Masters, lay down your weapons.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Go not home.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
U||Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
U||In our first way.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I'll bring him to you.
U||Let me desire your company: he must come,
U||Or what is worst will follow.
U||First Senator:
U||Pray you, let's to him.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
U||Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
U||Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
U||That the precipitation might down stretch
U||Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
U||Be thus to them.
U||A Patrician:
U||You do the nobler.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I muse my mother
U||Does not approve me further, who was wont
U||To call them woollen vassals, things created
U||To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
U||In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
U||When one but of my ordinance stood up
U||To speak of peace or war.
U||I talk of you:
U||Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
U||False to my nature? Rather say I play
U||The man I am.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||O, sir, sir, sir,
U||I would have had you put your power well on,
U||Before you had worn it out.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Let go.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||You might have been enough the man you are,
U||With striving less to be so; lesser had been
U||The thwartings of your dispositions, if
U||You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
U||Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Let them hang.
U||A Patrician:
U||Ay, and burn too.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Come, come, you have been too rough, something
U||too rough;
U||You must return and mend it.
U||First Senator:
U||There's no remedy;
U||Unless, by not so doing, our good city
U||Cleave in the midst, and perish.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Pray, be counsell'd:
U||I have a heart as little apt as yours,
U||But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
U||To better vantage.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Well said, noble woman?
U||Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
U||The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
U||For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
U||Which I can scarcely bear.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||What must I do?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Return to the tribunes.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Well, what then? what then?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Repent what you have spoke.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
U||Must I then do't to them?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||You are too absolute;
U||Though therein you can never be too noble,
U||But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
U||Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
U||I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
U||In peace what each of them by the other lose,
U||That they combine not there.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Tush, tush!
U||MENENIUS:
U||A good demand.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||If it be honour in your wars to seem
U||The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
U||You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
U||That it shall hold companionship in peace
U||With honour, as in war, since that to both
U||It stands in like request?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Why force you this?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Because that now it lies you on to speak
U||To the people; not by your own instruction,
U||Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
U||But with such words that are but rooted in
U||Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
U||Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
U||Now, this no more dishonours you at all
U||Than to take in a town with gentle words,
U||Which else would put you to your fortune and
U||The hazard of much blood.
U||I would dissemble with my nature where
U||My fortunes and my friends at stake required
U||I should do so in honour: I am in this,
U||Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
U||And you will rather show our general louts
U||How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
U||For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
U||Of what that want might ruin.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Noble lady!
U||Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
U||Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
U||Of what is past.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||I prithee now, my son,
U||Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
U||And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
U||Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
U||Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
U||More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
U||Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
U||Now humble as the ripest mulberry
U||That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
U||Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
U||Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
U||Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
U||In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
U||Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
U||As thou hast power and person.
U||MENENIUS:
U||This but done,
U||Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
U||For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
U||As words to little purpose.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Prithee now,
U||Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
U||Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
U||Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
U||COMINIUS:
U||I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
U||You make strong party, or defend yourself
U||By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Only fair speech.
U||COMINIUS:
U||I think 'twill serve, if he
U||Can thereto frame his spirit.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||He must, and will
U||Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
U||Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
U||A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
U||Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
U||This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
U||And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
U||You have put me now to such a part which never
U||I shall discharge to the life.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Come, come, we'll prompt you.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
U||My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
U||To have my praise for this, perform a part
U||Thou hast not done before.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Well, I must do't:
U||Away, my disposition, and possess me
U||Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
U||Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
U||Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
U||That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
U||Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
U||The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
U||Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
U||Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
U||That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
U||Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
U||And by my body's action teach my mind
U||A most inherent baseness.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||At thy choice, then:
U||To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
U||Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
U||Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
U||Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
U||With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
U||Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
U||But owe thy pride thyself.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Pray, be content:
U||Mother, I am going to the market-place;
U||Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
U||Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
U||Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
U||Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
U||Or never trust to what my tongue can do
U||I' the way of flattery further.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Do your will.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
U||To answer mildly; for they are prepared
U||With accusations, as I hear, more strong
U||Than are upon you yet.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
U||Let them accuse me by invention, I
U||Will answer in mine honour.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Ay, but mildly.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
U||BRUTUS:
U||In this point charge him home, that he affects
U||Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
U||Enforce him with his envy to the people,
U||And that the spoil got on the Antiates
U||Was ne'er distributed.
U||What, will he come?
U||AEdile:
U||He's coming.
U||BRUTUS:
U||How accompanied?
U||AEdile:
U||With old Menenius, and those senators
U||That always favour'd him.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Have you a catalogue
U||Of all the voices that we have procured
U||Set down by the poll?
U||AEdile:
U||I have; 'tis ready.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Have you collected them by tribes?
U||AEdile:
U||I have.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Assemble presently the people hither;
U||And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
U||I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
U||For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
U||If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
U||Insisting on the old prerogative
U||And power i' the truth o' the cause.
U||AEdile:
U||I shall inform them.
U||BRUTUS:
U||And when such time they have begun to cry,
U||Let them not cease, but with a din confused
U||Enforce the present execution
U||Of what we chance to sentence.
U||AEdile:
U||Very well.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
U||When we shall hap to give 't them.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Go about it.
U||Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
U||Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
U||Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
U||Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
U||What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
U||With us to break his neck.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Well, here he comes.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Calmly, I do beseech you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
U||Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
U||Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
U||Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
U||Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
U||And not our streets with war!
U||First Senator:
U||Amen, amen.
U||MENENIUS:
U||A noble wish.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Draw near, ye people.
U||AEdile:
U||List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||First, hear me speak.
U||Both Tribunes:
U||Well, say. Peace, ho!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Shall I be charged no further than this present?
U||Must all determine here?
U||SICINIUS:
U||I do demand,
U||If you submit you to the people's voices,
U||Allow their officers and are content
U||To suffer lawful censure for such faults
U||As shall be proved upon you?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I am content.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
U||The warlike service he has done, consider; think
U||Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
U||Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Scratches with briers,
U||Scars to move laughter only.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Consider further,
U||That when he speaks not like a citizen,
U||You find him like a soldier: do not take
U||His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
U||But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
U||Rather than envy you.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Well, well, no more.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||What is the matter
U||That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
U||I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
U||You take it off again?
U||SICINIUS:
U||Answer to us.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
U||SICINIUS:
U||We charge you, that you have contrived to take
U||From Rome all season'd office and to wind
U||Yourself into a power tyrannical;
U||For which you are a traitor to the people.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||How! traitor!
U||MENENIUS:
U||Nay, temperately; your promise.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
U||Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
U||Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
U||In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
U||Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
U||'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
U||As I do pray the gods.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Mark you this, people?
U||Citizens:
U||To the rock, to the rock with him!
U||SICINIUS:
U||Peace!
U||We need not put new matter to his charge:
U||What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
U||Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
U||Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
U||Those whose great power must try him; even this,
U||So criminal and in such capital kind,
U||Deserves the extremest death.
U||BRUTUS:
U||But since he hath
U||Served well for Rome,--
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||What do you prate of service?
U||BRUTUS:
U||I talk of that, that know it.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||You?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Is this the promise that you made your mother?
U||COMINIUS:
U||Know, I pray you,--
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I know no further:
U||Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
U||Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
U||But with a grain a day, I would not buy
U||Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
U||Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
U||To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
U||SICINIUS:
U||For that he has,
U||As much as in him lies, from time to time
U||Envied against the people, seeking means
U||To pluck away their power, as now at last
U||Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
U||Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
U||That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
U||And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
U||Even from this instant, banish him our city,
U||In peril of precipitation
U||From off the rock Tarpeian never more
U||To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
U||I say it shall be so.
U||Citizens:
U||It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
U||He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
U||SICINIUS:
U||He's sentenced; no more hearing.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Let me speak:
U||I have been consul, and can show for Rome
U||Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
U||My country's good with a respect more tender,
U||More holy and profound, than mine own life,
U||My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
U||And treasure of my loins; then if I would
U||Speak that,--
U||SICINIUS:
U||We know your drift: speak what?
U||BRUTUS:
U||There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
U||As enemy to the people and his country:
U||It shall be so.
U||Citizens:
U||It shall be so, it shall be so.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
U||As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
U||As the dead carcasses of unburied men
U||That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
U||And here remain with your uncertainty!
U||Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
U||Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
U||Fan you into despair! Have the power still
U||To banish your defenders; till at length
U||Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
U||Making not reservation of yourselves,
U||Still your own foes, deliver you as most
U||Abated captives to some nation
U||That won you without blows! Despising,
U||For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
U||There is a world elsewhere.
U||AEdile:
U||The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
U||Citizens:
U||Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
U||SICINIUS:
U||Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
U||As he hath followed you, with all despite;
U||Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
U||Attend us through the city.
U||Citizens:
U||Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
U||The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
U||With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
U||Where is your ancient courage? you were used
U||To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
U||That common chances common men could bear;
U||That when the sea was calm all boats alike
U||Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
U||When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
U||A noble cunning: you were used to load me
U||With precepts that would make invincible
U||The heart that conn'd them.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||O heavens! O heavens!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Nay! prithee, woman,--
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
U||And occupations perish!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||What, what, what!
U||I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
U||Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
U||If you had been the wife of Hercules,
U||Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
U||Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
U||Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
U||I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
U||Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
U||And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
U||I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
U||Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
U||'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
U||As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
U||My hazards still have been your solace: and
U||Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
U||Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
U||Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
U||Will or exceed the common or be caught
U||With cautelous baits and practise.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||My first son.
U||Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
U||With thee awhile: determine on some course,
U||More than a wild exposture to each chance
U||That starts i' the way before thee.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||O the gods!
U||COMINIUS:
U||I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
U||Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
U||And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
U||A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
U||O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
U||And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
U||I' the absence of the needer.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Fare ye well:
U||Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
U||Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
U||That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
U||Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
U||My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
U||Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
U||While I remain above the ground, you shall
U||Hear from me still, and never of me aught
U||But what is like me formerly.
U||MENENIUS:
U||That's worthily
U||As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
U||If I could shake off but one seven years
U||From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
U||I'ld with thee every foot.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Give me thy hand: Come.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
U||The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
U||In his behalf.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Now we have shown our power,
U||Let us seem humbler after it is done
U||Than when it was a-doing.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Bid them home:
U||Say their great enemy is gone, and they
U||Stand in their ancient strength.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Dismiss them home.
U||Here comes his mother.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Let's not meet her.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Why?
U||SICINIUS:
U||They say she's mad.
U||BRUTUS:
U||They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
U||Requite your love!
U||MENENIUS:
U||Peace, peace; be not so loud.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
U||Nay, and you shall hear some.
U||Will you be gone?
U||VIRGILIA:
U||SICINIUS:
U||Are you mankind?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
U||Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
U||To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
U||Than thou hast spoken words?
U||SICINIUS:
U||O blessed heavens!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
U||And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
U||Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
U||Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
U||His good sword in his hand.
U||SICINIUS:
U||What then?
U||VIRGILIA:
U||What then!
U||He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Bastards and all.
U||Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
U||MENENIUS:
U||Come, come, peace.
U||SICINIUS:
U||I would he had continued to his country
U||As he began, and not unknit himself
U||The noble knot he made.
U||BRUTUS:
U||I would he had.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
U||Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
U||As I can of those mysteries which heaven
U||Will not have earth to know.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Pray, let us go.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
U||You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
U||As far as doth the Capitol exceed
U||The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
U||This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
U||Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Well, well, we'll leave you.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Why stay we to be baited
U||With one that wants her wits?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Take my prayers with you.
U||I would the gods had nothing else to do
U||But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
U||But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
U||Of what lies heavy to't.
U||MENENIUS:
U||You have told them home;
U||And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
U||And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
U||Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
U||In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Fie, fie, fie!
U||Roman:
U||I know you well, sir, and you know
U||me: your name, I think, is Adrian.
U||Volsce:
U||It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
U||Roman:
U||I am a Roman; and my services are,
U||as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?
U||Volsce:
U||Nicanor? no.
U||Roman:
U||The same, sir.
U||Volsce:
U||You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
U||favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
U||news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
U||to find you out there: you have well saved me a
U||day's journey.
U||Roman:
U||There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
U||people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
U||Volsce:
U||Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
U||so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
U||hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
U||Roman:
U||The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
U||would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
U||so to heart the banishment of that worthy
U||Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
U||all power from the people and to pluck from them
U||their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
U||tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
U||breaking out.
U||Volsce:
U||Coriolanus banished!
U||Roman:
U||Banished, sir.
U||Volsce:
U||You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
U||Roman:
U||The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
U||said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
U||when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
U||Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
U||great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
U||of his country.
U||Volsce:
U||He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
U||accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
U||business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
U||Roman:
U||I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
U||strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
U||their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
U||Volsce:
U||A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
U||distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
U||and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
U||Roman:
U||I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
U||man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
U||So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
U||Volsce:
U||You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
U||to be glad of yours.
U||Roman:
U||Well, let us go together.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||A goodly city is this Antium. City,
U||'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
U||Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
U||Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
U||Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
U||In puny battle slay me.
U||Save you, sir.
U||Citizen:
U||And you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Direct me, if it be your will,
U||Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?
U||Citizen:
U||He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
U||At his house this night.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Which is his house, beseech you?
U||Citizen:
U||This, here before you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Thank you, sir: farewell.
U||O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
U||Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
U||Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
U||Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
U||Unseparable, shall within this hour,
U||On a dissension of a doit, break out
U||To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
U||Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
U||To take the one the other, by some chance,
U||Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
U||And interjoin their issues. So with me:
U||My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
U||This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
U||He does fair justice; if he give me way,
U||I'll do his country service.
U||First Servingman:
U||Wine, wine, wine! What service
U||is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Where's Cotus? my master calls
U||for him. Cotus!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
U||Appear not like a guest.
U||First Servingman:
U||What would you have, friend? whence are you?
U||Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I have deserved no better entertainment,
U||In being Coriolanus.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
U||head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
U||Pray, get you out.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Away!
U||Second Servingman:
U||Away! get you away.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Now thou'rt troublesome.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
U||Third Servingman:
U||What fellow's this?
U||First Servingman:
U||A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
U||out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.
U||Third Servingman:
U||What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
U||the house.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
U||Third Servingman:
U||What are you?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||A gentleman.
U||Third Servingman:
U||A marvellous poor one.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||True, so I am.
U||Third Servingman:
U||Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
U||station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
U||Third Servingman:
U||What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
U||strange guest he has here.
U||Second Servingman:
U||And I shall.
U||Third Servingman:
U||Where dwellest thou?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Under the canopy.
U||Third Servingman:
U||Under the canopy!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Ay.
U||Third Servingman:
U||Where's that?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I' the city of kites and crows.
U||Third Servingman:
U||I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
U||Then thou dwellest with daws too?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||No, I serve not thy master.
U||Third Servingman:
U||How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
U||mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
U||trencher, hence!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Where is this fellow?
U||Second Servingman:
U||Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
U||disturbing the lords within.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
U||Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||If, Tullus,
U||Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
U||Think me for the man I am, necessity
U||Commands me name myself.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||What is thy name?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
U||And harsh in sound to thine.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Say, what's thy name?
U||Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
U||Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
U||Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
U||thou me yet?
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||I know thee not: thy name?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
U||To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
U||Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
U||My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
U||The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
U||Shed for my thankless country are requited
U||But with that surname; a good memory,
U||And witness of the malice and displeasure
U||Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
U||The cruelty and envy of the people,
U||Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
U||Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
U||And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
U||Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
U||Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
U||Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
U||I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
U||I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
U||To be full quit of those my banishers,
U||Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
U||A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
U||Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
U||Of shame seen through thy country, speed
U||thee straight,
U||And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
U||That my revengeful services may prove
U||As benefits to thee, for I will fight
U||Against my canker'd country with the spleen
U||Of all the under fiends. But if so be
U||Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
U||Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
U||Longer to live most weary, and present
U||My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
U||Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
U||Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
U||Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
U||And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
U||It be to do thee service.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||O Marcius, Marcius!
U||Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
U||A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
U||Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
U||And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
U||Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
U||Mine arms about that body, where against
U||My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
U||And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
U||The anvil of my sword, and do contest
U||As hotly and as nobly with thy love
U||As ever in ambitious strength I did
U||Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
U||I loved the maid I married; never man
U||Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
U||Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
U||Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
U||Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
U||We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
U||Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
U||Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
U||Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
U||Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
U||We have been down together in my sleep,
U||Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
U||And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
U||Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
U||Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
U||From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
U||Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
U||Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
U||And take our friendly senators by the hands;
U||Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
U||Who am prepared against your territories,
U||Though not for Rome itself.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||You bless me, gods!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
U||The leading of thine own revenges, take
U||The one half of my commission; and set down--
U||As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
U||Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
U||Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
U||Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
U||To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
U||Let me commend thee first to those that shall
U||Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
U||And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
U||Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
U||First Servingman:
U||Here's a strange alteration!
U||Second Servingman:
U||By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
U||a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
U||false report of him.
U||First Servingman:
U||What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
U||finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
U||him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
U||cannot tell how to term it.
U||First Servingman:
U||He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
U||but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
U||Second Servingman:
U||So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
U||man i' the world.
U||First Servingman:
U||I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Who, my master?
U||First Servingman:
U||Nay, it's no matter for that.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Worth six on him.
U||First Servingman:
U||Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
U||greater soldier.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
U||for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
U||First Servingman:
U||Ay, and for an assault too.
U||Third Servingman:
U||O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
U||First Servingman:
U||What, what, what? let's partake.
U||Third Servingman:
U||I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
U||lieve be a condemned man.
U||First Servingman:
U||Wherefore? wherefore?
U||Third Servingman:
U||Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
U||Caius Marcius.
U||First Servingman:
U||Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
U||Third Servingman:
U||I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
U||good enough for him.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
U||hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
U||First Servingman:
U||He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
U||on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
U||him like a carbon ado.
U||Second Servingman:
U||An he had been cannibally given, he might have
U||broiled and eaten him too.
U||First Servingman:
U||But, more of thy news?
U||Third Servingman:
U||Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
U||and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
U||question asked him by any of the senators, but they
U||stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
U||mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
U||turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
U||the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
U||the middle and but one half of what he was
U||yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
U||and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
U||and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
U||will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.
U||Second Servingman:
U||And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
U||Third Servingman:
U||Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
U||many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
U||were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
U||we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.
U||First Servingman:
U||Directitude! what's that?
U||Third Servingman:
U||But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
U||and the man in blood, they will out of their
U||burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
U||him.
U||First Servingman:
U||But when goes this forward?
U||Third Servingman:
U||To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
U||drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
U||parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
U||wipe their lips.
U||Second Servingman:
U||Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
U||This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
U||tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
U||First Servingman:
U||Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
U||day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
U||full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
U||mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
U||bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
U||Second Servingman:
U||'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
U||be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
U||great maker of cuckolds.
U||First Servingman:
U||Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
U||Third Servingman:
U||Reason; because they then less need one another.
U||The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
U||as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
U||All:
U||In, in, in, in!
U||SICINIUS:
U||We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
U||His remedies are tame i' the present peace
U||And quietness of the people, which before
U||Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
U||Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
U||Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
U||Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
U||Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
U||About their functions friendly.
U||BRUTUS:
U||We stood to't in good time.
U||Is this Menenius?
U||SICINIUS:
U||'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
U||Both Tribunes:
U||Hail sir!
U||MENENIUS:
U||Hail to you both!
U||SICINIUS:
U||Your Coriolanus
U||Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
U||The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
U||Were he more angry at it.
U||MENENIUS:
U||All's well; and might have been much better, if
U||He could have temporized.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Where is he, hear you?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
U||Hear nothing from him.
U||Citizens:
U||The gods preserve you both!
U||SICINIUS:
U||God-den, our neighbours.
U||BRUTUS:
U||God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
U||First Citizen:
U||Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
U||Are bound to pray for you both.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Live, and thrive!
U||BRUTUS:
U||Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
U||Had loved you as we did.
U||Citizens:
U||Now the gods keep you!
U||Both Tribunes:
U||Farewell, farewell.
U||SICINIUS:
U||This is a happier and more comely time
U||Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
U||Crying confusion.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Caius Marcius was
U||A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
U||O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
U||Self-loving,--
U||SICINIUS:
U||And affecting one sole throne,
U||Without assistance.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I think not so.
U||SICINIUS:
U||We should by this, to all our lamentation,
U||If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
U||BRUTUS:
U||The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
U||Sits safe and still without him.
U||AEdile:
U||Worthy tribunes,
U||There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
U||Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
U||Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
U||And with the deepest malice of the war
U||Destroy what lies before 'em.
U||MENENIUS:
U||'Tis Aufidius,
U||Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
U||Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
U||Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
U||And durst not once peep out.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Come, what talk you
U||Of Marcius?
U||BRUTUS:
U||Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
U||The Volsces dare break with us.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Cannot be!
U||We have record that very well it can,
U||And three examples of the like have been
U||Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
U||Before you punish him, where he heard this,
U||Lest you shall chance to whip your information
U||And beat the messenger who bids beware
U||Of what is to be dreaded.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Tell not me:
U||I know this cannot be.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Not possible.
U||Messenger:
U||The nobles in great earnestness are going
U||All to the senate-house: some news is come
U||That turns their countenances.
U||SICINIUS:
U||'Tis this slave;--
U||Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
U||Nothing but his report.
U||Messenger:
U||Yes, worthy sir,
U||The slave's report is seconded; and more,
U||More fearful, is deliver'd.
U||SICINIUS:
U||What more fearful?
U||Messenger:
U||It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
U||How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
U||Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
U||And vows revenge as spacious as between
U||The young'st and oldest thing.
U||SICINIUS:
U||This is most likely!
U||BRUTUS:
U||Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
U||Good Marcius home again.
U||SICINIUS:
U||The very trick on't.
U||MENENIUS:
U||This is unlikely:
U||He and Aufidius can no more atone
U||Than violentest contrariety.
U||Second Messenger:
U||You are sent for to the senate:
U||A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
U||Associated with Aufidius, rages
U||Upon our territories; and have already
U||O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
U||What lay before them.
U||COMINIUS:
U||O, you have made good work!
U||MENENIUS:
U||What news? what news?
U||COMINIUS:
U||You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
U||To melt the city leads upon your pates,
U||To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
U||MENENIUS:
U||What's the news? what's the news?
U||COMINIUS:
U||Your temples burned in their cement, and
U||Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
U||Into an auger's bore.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Pray now, your news?
U||You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
U||If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--
U||COMINIUS:
U||If!
U||He is their god: he leads them like a thing
U||Made by some other deity than nature,
U||That shapes man better; and they follow him,
U||Against us brats, with no less confidence
U||Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
U||Or butchers killing flies.
U||MENENIUS:
U||You have made good work,
U||You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
U||on the voice of occupation and
U||The breath of garlic-eaters!
U||COMINIUS:
U||He will shake
U||Your Rome about your ears.
U||MENENIUS:
U||As Hercules
U||Did shake down mellow fruit.
U||You have made fair work!
U||BRUTUS:
U||But is this true, sir?
U||COMINIUS:
U||Ay; and you'll look pale
U||Before you find it other. All the regions
U||Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
U||Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
U||And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
U||Your enemies and his find something in him.
U||MENENIUS:
U||We are all undone, unless
U||The noble man have mercy.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Who shall ask it?
U||The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
U||Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
U||Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
U||Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
U||As those should do that had deserved his hate,
U||And therein show'd like enemies.
U||MENENIUS:
U||'Tis true:
U||If he were putting to my house the brand
U||That should consume it, I have not the face
U||To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
U||You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
U||COMINIUS:
U||You have brought
U||A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
U||So incapable of help.
U||Both Tribunes:
U||Say not we brought it.
U||MENENIUS:
U||How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
U||And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
U||Who did hoot him out o' the city.
U||COMINIUS:
U||But I fear
U||They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
U||The second name of men, obeys his points
U||As if he were his officer: desperation
U||Is all the policy, strength and defence,
U||That Rome can make against them.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Here come the clusters.
U||And is Aufidius with him? You are they
U||That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
U||Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
U||Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
U||And not a hair upon a soldier's head
U||Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
U||As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
U||And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
U||if he could burn us all into one coal,
U||We have deserved it.
U||Citizens:
U||Faith, we hear fearful news.
U||First Citizen:
U||For mine own part,
U||When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
U||Second Citizen:
U||And so did I.
U||Third Citizen:
U||And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
U||many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
U||though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
U||it was against our will.
U||COMINIUS:
U||Ye re goodly things, you voices!
U||MENENIUS:
U||You have made
U||Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
U||COMINIUS:
U||O, ay, what else?
U||SICINIUS:
U||Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
U||These are a side that would be glad to have
U||This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
U||And show no sign of fear.
U||First Citizen:
U||The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
U||I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
U||him.
U||Second Citizen:
U||So did we all. But, come, let's home.
U||BRUTUS:
U||I do not like this news.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Nor I.
U||BRUTUS:
U||Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
U||Would buy this for a lie!
U||SICINIUS:
U||Pray, let us go.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Do they still fly to the Roman?
U||Lieutenant:
U||I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
U||Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
U||Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
U||And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
U||Even by your own.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||I cannot help it now,
U||Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
U||Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
U||Even to my person, than I thought he would
U||When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
U||In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
U||What cannot be amended.
U||Lieutenant:
U||Yet I wish, sir,--
U||I mean for your particular,--you had not
U||Join'd in commission with him; but either
U||Had borne the action of yourself, or else
U||To him had left it solely.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
U||when he shall come to his account, he knows not
U||What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
U||And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
U||To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
U||And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
U||Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
U||As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
U||That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
U||Whene'er we come to our account.
U||Lieutenant:
U||Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||All places yield to him ere he sits down;
U||And the nobility of Rome are his:
U||The senators and patricians love him too:
U||The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
U||Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
U||To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
U||As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
U||By sovereignty of nature. First he was
U||A noble servant to them; but he could not
U||Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
U||Which out of daily fortune ever taints
U||The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
U||To fail in the disposing of those chances
U||Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
U||Not to be other than one thing, not moving
U||From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
U||Even with the same austerity and garb
U||As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
U||As he hath spices of them all, not all,
U||For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
U||So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
U||To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
U||Lie in the interpretation of the time:
U||And power, unto itself most commendable,
U||Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
U||To extol what it hath done.
U||One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
U||Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
U||Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
U||Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
U||MENENIUS:
U||No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
U||Which was sometime his general; who loved him
U||In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
U||But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
U||A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
U||The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
U||To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
U||COMINIUS:
U||He would not seem to know me.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Do you hear?
U||COMINIUS:
U||Yet one time he did call me by my name:
U||I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
U||That we have bled together. Coriolanus
U||He would not answer to: forbad all names;
U||He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
U||Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
U||Of burning Rome.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Why, so: you have made good work!
U||A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
U||To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
U||COMINIUS:
U||I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
U||When it was less expected: he replied,
U||It was a bare petition of a state
U||To one whom they had punish'd.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Very well:
U||Could he say less?
U||COMINIUS:
U||I offer'd to awaken his regard
U||For's private friends: his answer to me was,
U||He could not stay to pick them in a pile
U||Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
U||For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
U||And still to nose the offence.
U||MENENIUS:
U||For one poor grain or two!
U||I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
U||And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
U||You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
U||Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
U||In this so never-needed help, yet do not
U||Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
U||Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
U||More than the instant army we can make,
U||Might stop our countryman.
U||MENENIUS:
U||No, I'll not meddle.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Pray you, go to him.
U||MENENIUS:
U||What should I do?
U||BRUTUS:
U||Only make trial what your love can do
U||For Rome, towards Marcius.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Well, and say that Marcius
U||Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
U||Unheard; what then?
U||But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
U||With his unkindness? say't be so?
U||SICINIUS:
U||Yet your good will
U||must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
U||As you intended well.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I'll undertake 't:
U||I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
U||And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
U||He was not taken well; he had not dined:
U||The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
U||We pout upon the morning, are unapt
U||To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
U||These and these conveyances of our blood
U||With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
U||Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
U||Till he be dieted to my request,
U||And then I'll set upon him.
U||BRUTUS:
U||You know the very road into his kindness,
U||And cannot lose your way.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Good faith, I'll prove him,
U||Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
U||Of my success.
U||COMINIUS:
U||He'll never hear him.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Not?
U||COMINIUS:
U||I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
U||Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
U||The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
U||'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
U||Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
U||He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
U||Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
U||So that all hope is vain.
U||Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
U||Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
U||For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
U||And with our fair entreaties haste them on.
U||First Senator:
U||Stay: whence are you?
U||Second Senator:
U||Stand, and go back.
U||MENENIUS:
U||You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
U||I am an officer of state, and come
U||To speak with Coriolanus.
U||First Senator:
U||From whence?
U||MENENIUS:
U||From Rome.
U||First Senator:
U||You may not pass, you must return: our general
U||Will no more hear from thence.
U||Second Senator:
U||You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
U||You'll speak with Coriolanus.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Good my friends,
U||If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
U||And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
U||My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
U||First Senator:
U||Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
U||Is not here passable.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I tell thee, fellow,
U||The general is my lover: I have been
U||The book of his good acts, whence men have read
U||His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
U||For I have ever verified my friends,
U||Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
U||Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
U||Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
U||I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
U||Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
U||I must have leave to pass.
U||First Senator:
U||Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
U||behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
U||should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
U||to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
U||always factionary on the party of your general.
U||Second Senator:
U||Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
U||have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
U||say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
U||speak with him till after dinner.
U||First Senator:
U||You are a Roman, are you?
U||MENENIUS:
U||I am, as thy general is.
U||First Senator:
U||Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
U||when you have pushed out your gates the very
U||defender of them, and, in a violent popular
U||ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
U||front his revenges with the easy groans of old
U||women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
U||the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
U||you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
U||intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
U||such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
U||therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
U||execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
U||you out of reprieve and pardon.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
U||use me with estimation.
U||Second Senator:
U||Come, my captain knows you not.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I mean, thy general.
U||First Senator:
U||My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
U||I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
U||the utmost of your having: back.
U||MENENIUS:
U||Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||What's the matter?
U||MENENIUS:
U||Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
U||You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
U||perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
U||my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
U||with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
U||hanging, or of some death more long in
U||spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
U||presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
U||The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
U||particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
U||thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
U||thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
U||water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
U||thee; but being assured none but myself could move
U||thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
U||sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
U||petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
U||wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
U||here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
U||access to thee.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Away!
U||MENENIUS:
U||How! away!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
U||Are servanted to others: though I owe
U||My revenge properly, my remission lies
U||In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
U||Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
U||Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
U||Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
U||Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
U||Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
U||And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
U||I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
U||Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||You keep a constant temper.
U||First Senator:
U||Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
U||Second Senator:
U||'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
U||way home again.
U||First Senator:
U||Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
U||greatness back?
U||Second Senator:
U||What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
U||MENENIUS:
U||I neither care for the world nor your general: for
U||such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
U||ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
U||himself fears it not from another: let your general
U||do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
U||your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
U||as I was said to, Away!
U||First Senator:
U||A noble fellow, I warrant him.
U||Second Senator:
U||The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
U||oak not to be wind-shaken.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
U||Set down our host. My partner in this action,
U||You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
U||I have borne this business.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Only their ends
U||You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
U||The general suit of Rome; never admitted
U||A private whisper, no, not with such friends
U||That thought them sure of you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||This last old man,
U||Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
U||Loved me above the measure of a father;
U||Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
U||Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
U||Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
U||The first conditions, which they did refuse
U||And cannot now accept; to grace him only
U||That thought he could do more, a very little
U||I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
U||Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
U||Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
U||Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
U||In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
U||My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
U||Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
U||The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
U||All bond and privilege of nature, break!
U||Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
U||What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
U||Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
U||Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
U||As if Olympus to a molehill should
U||In supplication nod: and my young boy
U||Hath an aspect of intercession, which
U||Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
U||Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
U||Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
U||As if a man were author of himself
U||And knew no other kin.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||My lord and husband!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
U||Makes you think so.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Like a dull actor now,
U||I have forgot my part, and I am out,
U||Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
U||Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
U||For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
U||Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
U||Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
U||I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
U||Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
U||And the most noble mother of the world
U||Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
U||Of thy deep duty more impression show
U||Than that of common sons.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||O, stand up blest!
U||Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
U||I kneel before thee; and unproperly
U||Show duty, as mistaken all this while
U||Between the child and parent.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||What is this?
U||Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
U||Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
U||Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
U||Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
U||Murdering impossibility, to make
U||What cannot be, slight work.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Thou art my warrior;
U||I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||The noble sister of Publicola,
U||The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
U||That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
U||And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||This is a poor epitome of yours,
U||Which by the interpretation of full time
U||May show like all yourself.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||The god of soldiers,
U||With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
U||Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
U||To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
U||Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
U||And saving those that eye thee!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Your knee, sirrah.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||That's my brave boy!
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
U||Are suitors to you.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I beseech you, peace:
U||Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
U||The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
U||Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
U||Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
U||Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
U||Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
U||To ally my rages and revenges with
U||Your colder reasons.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||O, no more, no more!
U||You have said you will not grant us any thing;
U||For we have nothing else to ask, but that
U||Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
U||That, if you fail in our request, the blame
U||May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
U||Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
U||And state of bodies would bewray what life
U||We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
U||How more unfortunate than all living women
U||Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
U||which should
U||Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
U||with comforts,
U||Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
U||Making the mother, wife and child to see
U||The son, the husband and the father tearing
U||His country's bowels out. And to poor we
U||Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
U||Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
U||That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
U||Alas, how can we for our country pray.
U||Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
U||Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
U||The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
U||Our comfort in the country. We must find
U||An evident calamity, though we had
U||Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
U||Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
U||With manacles thorough our streets, or else
U||triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
U||And bear the palm for having bravely shed
U||Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
U||I purpose not to wait on fortune till
U||These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
U||Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
U||Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
U||March to assault thy country than to tread--
U||Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
U||That brought thee to this world.
U||VIRGILIA:
U||Ay, and mine,
U||That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
U||Living to time.
U||Young MARCIUS:
U||A' shall not tread on me;
U||I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
U||Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
U||I have sat too long.
U||VOLUMNIA:
U||Nay, go not from us thus.
U||If it were so that our request did tend
U||To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
U||The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
U||As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
U||Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
U||May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
U||'This we received;' and each in either side
U||Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
U||For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
U||The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
U||That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
U||Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
U||Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
U||Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
U||But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
U||Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
U||To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
U||Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
U||To imitate the graces of the gods;
U||To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
U||And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
U||That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
U||Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
U||Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
U||He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
U||Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
U||Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
U||More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
U||Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
U||Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
U||When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
U||Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
U||Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
U||And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
U||Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
U||That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
U||To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
U||Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
U||To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
U||Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
U||This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
U||And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
U||This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
U||But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
U||Does reason our petition with more strength
U||Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
U||This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
U||His wife is in Corioli and his child
U||Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
U||I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
U||And then I'll speak a little.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||O mother, mother!
U||What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
U||The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
U||They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
U||You have won a happy victory to Rome;
U||But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
U||Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
U||If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
U||Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
U||I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
U||Were you in my stead, would you have heard
U||A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||I was moved withal.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||I dare be sworn you were:
U||And, sir, it is no little thing to make
U||Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
U||What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
U||I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
U||Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Ay, by and by;
U||But we will drink together; and you shall bear
U||A better witness back than words, which we,
U||On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
U||Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
U||To have a temple built you: all the swords
U||In Italy, and her confederate arms,
U||Could not have made this peace.
U||MENENIUS:
U||See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
U||corner-stone?
U||SICINIUS:
U||Why, what of that?
U||MENENIUS:
U||If it be possible for you to displace it with your
U||little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
U||Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
U||But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
U||sentenced and stay upon execution.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
U||condition of a man!
U||MENENIUS:
U||There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
U||yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
U||from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
U||creeping thing.
U||SICINIUS:
U||He loved his mother dearly.
U||MENENIUS:
U||So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
U||now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
U||of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
U||moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
U||his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
U||his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
U||battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
U||Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
U||his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
U||and a heaven to throne in.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
U||MENENIUS:
U||I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
U||mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
U||in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
U||shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
U||you.
U||SICINIUS:
U||The gods be good unto us!
U||MENENIUS:
U||No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
U||us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
U||and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.
U||Messenger:
U||Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
U||The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
U||And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
U||The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
U||They'll give him death by inches.
U||SICINIUS:
U||What's the news?
U||Second Messenger:
U||Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
U||The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
U||A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
U||No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
U||SICINIUS:
U||Friend,
U||Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
U||Second Messenger:
U||As certain as I know the sun is fire:
U||Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
U||Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
U||As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
U||The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
U||Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
U||Make the sun dance. Hark you!
U||MENENIUS:
U||This is good news:
U||I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
U||Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
U||A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
U||A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
U||This morning for ten thousand of your throats
U||I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
U||SICINIUS:
U||First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
U||Accept my thankfulness.
U||Second Messenger:
U||Sir, we have all
U||Great cause to give great thanks.
U||SICINIUS:
U||They are near the city?
U||Second Messenger:
U||Almost at point to enter.
U||SICINIUS:
U||We will meet them,
U||And help the joy.
U||First Senator:
U||Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
U||Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
U||And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
U||Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
U||Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
U||Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
U||All:
U||Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
U||Deliver them this paper: having read it,
U||Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
U||Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
U||Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
U||The city ports by this hath enter'd and
U||Intends to appear before the people, hoping
U||To purge herself with words: dispatch.
U||Most welcome!
U||First Conspirator:
U||How is it with our general?
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Even so
U||As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
U||And with his charity slain.
U||Second Conspirator:
U||Most noble sir,
U||If you do hold the same intent wherein
U||You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
U||Of your great danger.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Sir, I cannot tell:
U||We must proceed as we do find the people.
U||Third Conspirator:
U||The people will remain uncertain whilst
U||'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
U||Makes the survivor heir of all.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||I know it;
U||And my pretext to strike at him admits
U||A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
U||Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
U||He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
U||Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
U||He bow'd his nature, never known before
U||But to be rough, unswayable and free.
U||Third Conspirator:
U||Sir, his stoutness
U||When he did stand for consul, which he lost
U||By lack of stooping,--
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||That I would have spoke of:
U||Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
U||Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
U||Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
U||In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
U||Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
U||My best and freshest men; served his designments
U||In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
U||Which he did end all his; and took some pride
U||To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
U||I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
U||He waged me with his countenance, as if
U||I had been mercenary.
U||First Conspirator:
U||So he did, my lord:
U||The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
U||When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
U||For no less spoil than glory,--
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||There was it:
U||For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
U||At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
U||As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
U||Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
U||And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
U||First Conspirator:
U||Your native town you enter'd like a post,
U||And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
U||Splitting the air with noise.
U||Second Conspirator:
U||And patient fools,
U||Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
U||With giving him glory.
U||Third Conspirator:
U||Therefore, at your vantage,
U||Ere he express himself, or move the people
U||With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
U||Which we will second. When he lies along,
U||After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
U||His reasons with his body.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Say no more:
U||Here come the lords.
U||All The Lords:
U||You are most welcome home.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||I have not deserved it.
U||But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
U||What I have written to you?
U||Lords:
U||We have.
U||First Lord:
U||And grieve to hear't.
U||What faults he made before the last, I think
U||Might have found easy fines: but there to end
U||Where he was to begin and give away
U||The benefit of our levies, answering us
U||With our own charge, making a treaty where
U||There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||He approaches: you shall hear him.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
U||No more infected with my country's love
U||Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
U||Under your great command. You are to know
U||That prosperously I have attempted and
U||With bloody passage led your wars even to
U||The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
U||Do more than counterpoise a full third part
U||The charges of the action. We have made peace
U||With no less honour to the Antiates
U||Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
U||Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
U||Together with the seal o' the senate, what
U||We have compounded on.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Read it not, noble lords;
U||But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
U||He hath abused your powers.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Traitor! how now!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Ay, traitor, Marcius!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Marcius!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
U||I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
U||Coriolanus in Corioli?
U||You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
U||He has betray'd your business, and given up,
U||For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
U||I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
U||Breaking his oath and resolution like
U||A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
U||Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
U||He whined and roar'd away your victory,
U||That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
U||Look'd wondering each at other.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Hear'st thou, Mars?
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Ha!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||No more.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
U||Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
U||Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
U||I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
U||Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
U||Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
U||Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
U||To thrust the lie unto him.
U||First Lord:
U||Peace, both, and hear me speak.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
U||Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
U||If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
U||That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
U||Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
U||Alone I did it. Boy!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Why, noble lords,
U||Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
U||Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
U||'Fore your own eyes and ears?
U||All Conspirators:
U||Let him die for't.
U||All The People:
U||'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
U||my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
U||Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
U||Second Lord:
U||Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
U||The man is noble and his fame folds-in
U||This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
U||Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
U||And trouble not the peace.
U||CORIOLANUS:
U||O that I had him,
U||With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
U||To use my lawful sword!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||Insolent villain!
U||All Conspirators:
U||Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
U||Lords:
U||Hold, hold, hold, hold!
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||My noble masters, hear me speak.
U||First Lord:
U||O Tullus,--
U||Second Lord:
U||Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
U||Third Lord:
U||Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
U||Put up your swords.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
U||Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
U||Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
U||That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
U||To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
U||Myself your loyal servant, or endure
U||Your heaviest censure.
U||First Lord:
U||Bear from hence his body;
U||And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
U||As the most noble corse that ever herald
U||Did follow to his urn.
U||Second Lord:
U||His own impatience
U||Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
U||Let's make the best of it.
U||AUFIDIUS:
U||My rage is gone;
U||And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
U||Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
U||Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
U||Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
U||Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
U||Which to this hour bewail the injury,
U||Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Now is the winter of our discontent
U||Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
U||And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
U||In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
U||Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
U||Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
U||Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
U||Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
U||Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
U||And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
U||To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
U||He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
U||To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
U||But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
U||Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
U||I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
U||To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
U||I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
U||Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
U||Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
U||Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
U||And that so lamely and unfashionable
U||That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
U||Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
U||Have no delight to pass away the time,
U||Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
U||And descant on mine own deformity:
U||And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
U||To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
U||I am determined to prove a villain
U||And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
U||Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
U||By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
U||To set my brother Clarence and the king
U||In deadly hate the one against the other:
U||And if King Edward be as true and just
U||As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
U||This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
U||About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
U||Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
U||Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
U||Clarence comes.
U||Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
U||That waits upon your grace?
U||CLARENCE:
U||His majesty
U||Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
U||This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Upon what cause?
U||CLARENCE:
U||Because my name is George.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
U||He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
U||O, belike his majesty hath some intent
U||That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
U||But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
U||CLARENCE:
U||Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
U||As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
U||He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
U||And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
U||And says a wizard told him that by G
U||His issue disinherited should be;
U||And, for my name of George begins with G,
U||It follows in his thought that I am he.
U||These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
U||Have moved his highness to commit me now.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
U||'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
U||My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
U||That tempers him to this extremity.
U||Was it not she and that good man of worship,
U||Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
U||That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
U||From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
U||We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
U||CLARENCE:
U||By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
U||But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
U||That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
U||Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
U||Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Humbly complaining to her deity
U||Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
U||I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
U||If we will keep in favour with the king,
U||To be her men and wear her livery:
U||The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
U||Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
U||Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
U||His majesty hath straitly given in charge
U||That no man shall have private conference,
U||Of what degree soever, with his brother.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
U||You may partake of any thing we say:
U||We speak no treason, man: we say the king
U||Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
U||Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
U||We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
U||A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
U||And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
U||How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
U||He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
U||Were best he do it secretly, alone.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||What one, my lord?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
U||Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
U||CLARENCE:
U||We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
U||Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
U||And whatsoever you will employ me in,
U||Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
U||I will perform it to enfranchise you.
U||Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
U||Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
U||CLARENCE:
U||I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
U||Meantime, have patience.
U||CLARENCE:
U||I must perforce. Farewell.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
U||Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
U||That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
U||If heaven will take the present at our hands.
U||But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
U||HASTINGS:
U||Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
U||Well are you welcome to the open air.
U||How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
U||HASTINGS:
U||With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
U||But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
U||That were the cause of my imprisonment.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
U||For they that were your enemies are his,
U||And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
U||HASTINGS:
U||More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
U||While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||What news abroad?
U||HASTINGS:
U||No news so bad abroad as this at home;
U||The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
U||And his physicians fear him mightily.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
U||O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
U||And overmuch consumed his royal person:
U||'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
U||What, is he in his bed?
U||HASTINGS:
U||He is.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Go you before, and I will follow you.
U||He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
U||Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
U||I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
U||With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
U||And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
U||Clarence hath not another day to live:
U||Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
U||And leave the world for me to bustle in!
U||For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
U||What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
U||The readiest way to make the wench amends
U||Is to become her husband and her father:
U||The which will I; not all so much for love
U||As for another secret close intent,
U||By marrying her which I must reach unto.
U||But yet I run before my horse to market:
U||Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
U||When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Set down, set down your honourable load,
U||If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
U||Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
U||The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
U||Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
U||Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
U||Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
U||Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
U||To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
U||Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
U||Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
U||Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
U||I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
U||Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
U||Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
U||Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
U||More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
U||That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
U||Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
U||Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
U||If ever he have child, abortive be it,
U||Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
U||Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
U||May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
U||And that be heir to his unhappiness!
U||If ever he have wife, let her he made
U||A miserable by the death of him
U||As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
U||Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
U||Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
U||And still, as you are weary of the weight,
U||Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||What black magician conjures up this fiend,
U||To stop devoted charitable deeds?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
U||I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
U||Gentleman:
U||My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
U||Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
U||Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
U||And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
U||Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
U||And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
U||Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
U||Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
U||His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
U||For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
U||Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
U||If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
U||Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
U||O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
U||Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
U||Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
U||For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
U||From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
U||Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
U||Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
U||O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
U||O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
U||Either heaven with lightning strike the
U||murderer dead,
U||Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
U||As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
U||Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Lady, you know no rules of charity,
U||Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
U||No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
U||Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
U||Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
U||By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
U||For these known evils, but to give me leave,
U||By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
U||Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
U||No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||By such despair, I should accuse myself.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
U||For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
U||Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Say that I slew them not?
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Why, then they are not dead:
U||But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I did not kill your husband.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Why, then he is alive.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
U||Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
U||The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
U||But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
U||which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
U||Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
U||Didst thou not kill this king?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I grant ye.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
U||Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
U||O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
U||For he was fitter for that place than earth.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||And thou unfit for any place but hell.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Some dungeon.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Your bed-chamber.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||So will it, madam till I lie with you.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||I hope so.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
U||To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
U||And fall somewhat into a slower method,
U||Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
U||Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
U||As blameful as the executioner?
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
U||Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
U||To undertake the death of all the world,
U||So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
U||These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
U||You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
U||As all the world is cheered by the sun,
U||So I by that; it is my day, my life.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||It is a quarrel most unnatural,
U||To be revenged on him that loveth you.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
U||To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
U||Did it to help thee to a better husband.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||He lives that loves thee better than he could.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Name him.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Plantagenet.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Why, that was he.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Where is he?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Here.
U||Why dost thou spit at me?
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Never came poison from so sweet a place.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
U||Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I would they were, that I might die at once;
U||For now they kill me with a living death.
U||Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
U||Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
U||These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
U||No, when my father York and Edward wept,
U||To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
U||When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
U||Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
U||Told the sad story of my father's death,
U||And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
U||That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
U||Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
U||My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
U||And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
U||Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
U||I never sued to friend nor enemy;
U||My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
U||But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
U||My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
U||Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
U||For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
U||If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
U||Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
U||Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
U||And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
U||I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
U||And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
U||Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
U||But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
U||Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
U||But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
U||Take up the sword again, or take up me.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
U||I will not be the executioner.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||I have already.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Tush, that was in thy rage:
U||Speak it again, and, even with the word,
U||That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
U||Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
U||To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||I would I knew thy heart.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||'Tis figured in my tongue.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||I fear me both are false.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Then never man was true.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Well, well, put up your sword.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Say, then, my peace is made.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||That shall you know hereafter.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||But shall I live in hope?
U||LADY ANNE:
U||All men, I hope, live so.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||To take is not to give.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
U||Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
U||Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
U||And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
U||But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
U||Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||What is it?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||That it would please thee leave these sad designs
U||To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
U||And presently repair to Crosby Place;
U||Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
U||At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
U||And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
U||I will with all expedient duty see you:
U||For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
U||Grant me this boon.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
U||To see you are become so penitent.
U||Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Bid me farewell.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||'Tis more than you deserve;
U||But since you teach me how to flatter you,
U||Imagine I have said farewell already.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Sirs, take up the corse.
U||GENTLEMEN:
U||Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
U||Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
U||Was ever woman in this humour won?
U||I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
U||What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
U||To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
U||With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
U||The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
U||Having God, her conscience, and these bars
U||against me,
U||And I nothing to back my suit at all,
U||But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
U||And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
U||Ha!
U||Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
U||Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
U||Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
U||A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
U||Framed in the prodigality of nature,
U||Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
U||The spacious world cannot again afford
U||And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
U||That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
U||And made her widow to a woful bed?
U||On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
U||On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
U||My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
U||I do mistake my person all this while:
U||Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
U||Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
U||I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
U||And entertain some score or two of tailors,
U||To study fashions to adorn my body:
U||Since I am crept in favour with myself,
U||Will maintain it with some little cost.
U||But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
U||And then return lamenting to my love.
U||Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
U||That I may see my shadow as I pass.
U||RIVERS:
U||Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
U||Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
U||GREY:
U||In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
U||Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
U||And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||If he were dead, what would betide of me?
U||RIVERS:
U||No other harm but loss of such a lord.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
U||GREY:
U||The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
U||To be your comforter when he is gone.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Oh, he is young and his minority
U||Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
U||A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
U||RIVERS:
U||Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||It is determined, not concluded yet:
U||But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
U||GREY:
U||Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Good time of day unto your royal grace!
U||DERBY:
U||God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
U||To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
U||Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
U||And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
U||I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
U||DERBY:
U||I do beseech you, either not believe
U||The envious slanders of her false accusers;
U||Or, if she be accused in true report,
U||Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
U||From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
U||RIVERS:
U||Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
U||DERBY:
U||But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
U||Are come from visiting his majesty.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
U||Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
U||And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
U||And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Would all were well! but that will never be
U||I fear our happiness is at the highest.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
U||Who are they that complain unto the king,
U||That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
U||By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
U||That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
U||Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
U||Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
U||Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
U||I must be held a rancorous enemy.
U||Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
U||But thus his simple truth must be abused
U||By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
U||RIVERS:
U||To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
U||When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
U||Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
U||A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
U||Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
U||Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
U||But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
U||The king, of his own royal disposition,
U||And not provoked by any suitor else;
U||Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
U||Which in your outward actions shows itself
U||Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
U||Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
U||The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
U||That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
U||Since every Jack became a gentleman
U||There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
U||Gloucester;
U||You envy my advancement and my friends':
U||God grant we never may have need of you!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
U||Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
U||Myself disgraced, and the nobility
U||Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
U||Are daily given to ennoble those
U||That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||By Him that raised me to this careful height
U||From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
U||I never did incense his majesty
U||Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
U||An earnest advocate to plead for him.
U||My lord, you do me shameful injury,
U||Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||You may deny that you were not the cause
U||Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
U||RIVERS:
U||She may, my lord, for--
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
U||She may do more, sir, than denying that:
U||She may help you to many fair preferments,
U||And then deny her aiding hand therein,
U||And lay those honours on your high deserts.
U||What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
U||RIVERS:
U||What, marry, may she?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
U||A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
U||I wis your grandam had a worser match.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
U||Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
U||By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
U||With those gross taunts I often have endured.
U||I had rather be a country servant-maid
U||Than a great queen, with this condition,
U||To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
U||Small joy have I in being England's queen.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
U||Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||What! threat you me with telling of the king?
U||Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
U||I will avouch in presence of the king:
U||I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
U||'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Out, devil! I remember them too well:
U||Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
U||And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
U||I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
U||A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
U||A liberal rewarder of his friends:
U||To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||In all which time you and your husband Grey
U||Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
U||And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
U||In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
U||Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
U||What you have been ere now, and what you are;
U||Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
U||Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Which God revenge!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
U||And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
U||I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
U||Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
U||I am too childish-foolish for this world.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
U||Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
U||RIVERS:
U||My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
U||Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
U||We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
U||So should we you, if you should be our king.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
U||Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
U||You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
U||As little joy may you suppose in me.
U||That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
U||For I am she, and altogether joyless.
U||I can no longer hold me patient.
U||Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
U||In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
U||Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
U||If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
U||Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
U||O gentle villain, do not turn away!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
U||That will I make before I let thee go.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
U||Than death can yield me here by my abode.
U||A husband and a son thou owest to me;
U||And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
U||The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
U||And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||The curse my noble father laid on thee,
U||When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
U||And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
U||And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
U||Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
U||His curses, then from bitterness of soul
U||Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
U||And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||So just is God, to right the innocent.
U||HASTINGS:
U||O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
U||And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
U||RIVERS:
U||Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
U||DORSET:
U||No man but prophesied revenge for it.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||What were you snarling all before I came,
U||Ready to catch each other by the throat,
U||And turn you all your hatred now on me?
U||Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
U||That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
U||Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
U||Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
U||Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
U||Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
U||If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
U||As ours by murder, to make him a king!
U||Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
U||For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
U||Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
U||Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
U||Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
U||Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
U||And see another, as I see thee now,
U||Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
U||Long die thy happy days before thy death;
U||And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
U||Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
U||Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
U||And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
U||Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
U||That none of you may live your natural age,
U||But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
U||If heaven have any grievous plague in store
U||Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
U||O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
U||And then hurl down their indignation
U||On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
U||The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
U||Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
U||And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
U||No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
U||Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
U||Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
U||Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
U||Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
U||The slave of nature and the son of hell!
U||Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
U||Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
U||Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Margaret.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Richard!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Ha!
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||I call thee not.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
U||That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
U||O, let me make the period to my curse!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
U||Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
U||Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
U||Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
U||The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
U||To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
U||HASTINGS:
U||False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
U||Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
U||RIVERS:
U||Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
U||Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
U||O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
U||DORSET:
U||Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
U||Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
U||O, that your young nobility could judge
U||What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
U||They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
U||And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
U||DORSET:
U||It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
U||Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
U||And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
U||Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
U||Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
U||Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
U||Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
U||O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
U||As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
U||Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
U||And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
U||My charity is outrage, life my shame
U||And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Have done, have done.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
U||In sign of league and amity with thee:
U||Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
U||Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
U||Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Nor no one here; for curses never pass
U||The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
U||And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
U||O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
U||Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
U||His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
U||Have not to do with him, beware of him;
U||Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
U||And all their ministers attend on him.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
U||And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
U||O, but remember this another day,
U||When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
U||And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
U||Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
U||And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
U||HASTINGS:
U||My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
U||RIVERS:
U||And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
U||She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
U||My part thereof that I have done to her.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||I never did her any, to my knowledge.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
U||I was too hot to do somebody good,
U||That is too cold in thinking of it now.
U||Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
U||He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
U||God pardon them that are the cause of it!
U||RIVERS:
U||A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
U||To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||So do I ever:
U||being well-advised.
U||For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
U||CATESBY:
U||Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
U||And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
U||RIVERS:
U||Madam, we will attend your grace.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
U||The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
U||I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
U||Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
U||I do beweep to many simple gulls
U||Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
U||And say it is the queen and her allies
U||That stir the king against the duke my brother.
U||Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
U||To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
U||But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
U||Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
U||And thus I clothe my naked villany
U||With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
U||And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
U||But, soft! here come my executioners.
U||How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
U||Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
U||First Murderer:
U||We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
U||That we may be admitted where he is.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
U||When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
U||But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
U||Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
U||For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
U||May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
U||First Murderer:
U||Tush!
U||Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
U||Talkers are no good doers: be assured
U||We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
U||I like you, lads; about your business straight;
U||Go, go, dispatch.
U||First Murderer:
U||We will, my noble lord.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||Why looks your grace so heavily today?
U||CLARENCE:
U||O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
U||So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
U||That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
U||I would not spend another such a night,
U||Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
U||So full of dismal terror was the time!
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
U||And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
U||And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
U||Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
U||Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
U||And cited up a thousand fearful times,
U||During the wars of York and Lancaster
U||That had befall'n us. As we paced along
U||Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
U||Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
U||Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
U||Into the tumbling billows of the main.
U||Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
U||What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
U||What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
U||Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
U||Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
U||Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
U||Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
U||All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
U||Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
U||Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
U||As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
U||Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
U||And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||Had you such leisure in the time of death
U||To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
U||CLARENCE:
U||Methought I had; and often did I strive
U||To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
U||Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
U||To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
U||But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
U||Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||Awaked you not with this sore agony?
U||CLARENCE:
U||O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
U||O, then began the tempest to my soul,
U||Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
U||With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
U||Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
U||The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
U||Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
U||Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
U||Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
U||And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
U||A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
U||Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
U||'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
U||That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
U||Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
U||With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
U||Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
U||Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
U||I trembling waked, and for a season after
U||Could not believe but that I was in hell,
U||Such terrible impression made the dream.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
U||I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
U||CLARENCE:
U||O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
U||Which now bear evidence against my soul,
U||For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
U||O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
U||But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
U||Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
U||O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
U||I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
U||My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
U||Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
U||Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
U||Princes have but their tides for their glories,
U||An outward honour for an inward toil;
U||And, for unfelt imagination,
U||They often feel a world of restless cares:
U||So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
U||There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
U||First Murderer:
U||Ho! who's here?
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
U||First Murderer:
U||I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||Yea, are you so brief?
U||Second Murderer:
U||O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
U||him our commission; talk no more.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||I am, in this, commanded to deliver
U||The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
U||I will not reason what is meant hereby,
U||Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
U||Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
U||I'll to the king; and signify to him
U||That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
U||First Murderer:
U||Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
U||Second Murderer:
U||What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
U||First Murderer:
U||No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
U||Second Murderer:
U||When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
U||the judgment-day.
U||First Murderer:
U||Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
U||Second Murderer:
U||The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
U||of remorse in me.
U||First Murderer:
U||What, art thou afraid?
U||Second Murderer:
U||Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
U||damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
U||First Murderer:
U||I thought thou hadst been resolute.
U||Second Murderer:
U||So I am, to let him live.
U||First Murderer:
U||Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
U||Second Murderer:
U||I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
U||will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
U||would tell twenty.
U||First Murderer:
U||How dost thou feel thyself now?
U||Second Murderer:
U||'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
U||within me.
U||First Murderer:
U||Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
U||Second Murderer:
U||'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
U||First Murderer:
U||Where is thy conscience now?
U||Second Murderer:
U||In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
U||First Murderer:
U||So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
U||thy conscience flies out.
U||Second Murderer:
U||Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
U||First Murderer:
U||How if it come to thee again?
U||Second Murderer:
U||I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
U||makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
U||accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
U||he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
U||detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
U||mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
U||obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
U||that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
U||is turned out of all towns and cities for a
U||dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
U||well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
U||without it.
U||First Murderer:
U||'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
U||not to kill the duke.
U||Second Murderer:
U||Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
U||would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
U||First Murderer:
U||Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
U||I warrant thee.
U||Second Murderer:
U||Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
U||reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
U||First Murderer:
U||Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
U||sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
U||in the next room.
U||Second Murderer:
U||O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
U||First Murderer:
U||Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
U||Second Murderer:
U||No, first let's reason with him.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
U||Second murderer:
U||You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
U||CLARENCE:
U||In God's name, what art thou?
U||Second Murderer:
U||A man, as you are.
U||CLARENCE:
U||But not, as I am, royal.
U||Second Murderer:
U||Nor you, as we are, loyal.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
U||Second Murderer:
U||My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
U||CLARENCE:
U||How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
U||Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
U||Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
U||Both:
U||To, to, to--
U||CLARENCE:
U||To murder me?
U||Both:
U||Ay, ay.
U||CLARENCE:
U||You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
U||And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
U||Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
U||First Murderer:
U||Offended us you have not, but the king.
U||CLARENCE:
U||I shall be reconciled to him again.
U||Second Murderer:
U||Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
U||To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
U||Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
U||What lawful quest have given their verdict up
U||Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
U||The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
U||Before I be convict by course of law,
U||To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
U||I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
U||By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
U||That you depart and lay no hands on me
U||The deed you undertake is damnable.
U||First Murderer:
U||What we will do, we do upon command.
U||Second Murderer:
U||And he that hath commanded is the king.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
U||Hath in the tables of his law commanded
U||That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
U||Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
U||Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
U||To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
U||Second Murderer:
U||And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
U||For false forswearing and for murder too:
U||Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
U||To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
U||First Murderer:
U||And, like a traitor to the name of God,
U||Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
U||Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
U||Second Murderer:
U||Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
U||First Murderer:
U||How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
U||When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
U||CLARENCE:
U||Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
U||For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
U||He sends ye not to murder me for this
U||For in this sin he is as deep as I.
U||If God will be revenged for this deed.
U||O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
U||Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
U||He needs no indirect nor lawless course
U||To cut off those that have offended him.
U||First Murderer:
U||Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
U||When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
U||That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
U||CLARENCE:
U||My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
U||First Murderer:
U||Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
U||Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
U||I am his brother, and I love him well.
U||If you be hired for meed, go back again,
U||And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
U||Who shall reward you better for my life
U||Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
U||Second Murderer:
U||You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
U||CLARENCE:
U||O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
U||Go you to him from me.
U||Both:
U||Ay, so we will.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Tell him, when that our princely father York
U||Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
U||And charged us from his soul to love each other,
U||He little thought of this divided friendship:
U||Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
U||First Murderer:
U||Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
U||CLARENCE:
U||O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
U||First Murderer:
U||Right,
U||As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
U||'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
U||CLARENCE:
U||It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
U||He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
U||That he would labour my delivery.
U||Second Murderer:
U||Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
U||From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
U||First Murderer:
U||Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
U||To counsel me to make my peace with God,
U||And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
U||That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
U||Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
U||To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
U||Second Murderer:
U||What shall we do?
U||CLARENCE:
U||Relent, and save your souls.
U||First Murderer:
U||Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
U||CLARENCE:
U||Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
U||Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
U||Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
U||if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
U||Would not entreat for life?
U||My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
U||O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
U||Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
U||As you would beg, were you in my distress
U||A begging prince what beggar pities not?
U||Second Murderer:
U||Look behind you, my lord.
U||First Murderer:
U||Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
U||I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
U||Second Murderer:
U||A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
U||How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
U||Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
U||First Murderer:
U||How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
U||By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
U||Second Murderer:
U||I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
U||Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
U||For I repent me that the duke is slain.
U||First Murderer:
U||So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
U||Now must I hide his body in some hole,
U||Until the duke take order for his burial:
U||And when I have my meed, I must away;
U||For this will out, and here I must not stay.
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
U||You peers, continue this united league:
U||I every day expect an embassage
U||From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
U||And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
U||Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
U||Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
U||Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
U||RIVERS:
U||By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
U||And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
U||HASTINGS:
U||So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Take heed you dally not before your king;
U||Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
U||Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
U||Either of you to be the other's end.
U||HASTINGS:
U||So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
U||RIVERS:
U||And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
U||Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
U||You have been factious one against the other,
U||Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
U||And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
U||Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
U||DORSET:
U||This interchange of love, I here protest,
U||Upon my part shall be unviolable.
U||HASTINGS:
U||And so swear I, my lord
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
U||With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
U||And make me happy in your unity.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
U||On you or yours,
U||but with all duteous love
U||Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
U||With hate in those where I expect most love!
U||When I have most need to employ a friend,
U||And most assured that he is a friend
U||Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
U||Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
U||When I am cold in zeal to yours.
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
U||is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
U||There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
U||To make the perfect period of this peace.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
U||And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
U||Brother, we done deeds of charity;
U||Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
U||Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
U||Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
U||By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
U||Hold me a foe;
U||If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
U||Have aught committed that is hardly borne
U||By any in this presence, I desire
U||To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
U||'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
U||I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
U||First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
U||Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
U||Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
U||If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
U||Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
U||That without desert have frown'd on me;
U||Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
U||I do not know that Englishman alive
U||With whom my soul is any jot at odds
U||More than the infant that is born to-night
U||I thank my God for my humility.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
U||I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
U||My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
U||To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
U||To be so bouted in this royal presence?
U||Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
U||You do him injury to scorn his corse.
U||RIVERS:
U||Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
U||DORSET:
U||Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
U||But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
U||And that a winged Mercury did bear:
U||Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
U||That came too lag to see him buried.
U||God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
U||Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
U||Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
U||And yet go current from suspicion!
U||DORSET:
U||A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
U||DORSET:
U||I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
U||DORSET:
U||The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
U||Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
U||Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
U||KING EDWARD IV:
U||Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
U||And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
U||My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
U||And yet his punishment was cruel death.
U||Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
U||Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
U||Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
U||Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
U||The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
U||Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
U||When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
U||And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
U||Who told me, when we both lay in the field
U||Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
U||Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
U||All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
U||All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
U||Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
U||Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
U||But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
U||Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
U||The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
U||You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
U||And I unjustly too, must grant it you
U||But for my brother not a man would speak,
U||Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
U||For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
U||Have been beholding to him in his life;
U||Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
U||O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
U||On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
U||Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
U||Oh, poor Clarence!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
U||How that the guilty kindred of the queen
U||Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
U||O, they did urge it still unto the king!
U||God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
U||To comfort Edward with our company.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||We wait upon your grace.
U||Boy:
U||Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||No, boy.
U||Boy:
U||Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
U||And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
U||Girl:
U||Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
U||And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
U||If that our noble father be alive?
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
U||I do lament the sickness of the king.
U||As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
U||It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
U||Boy:
U||Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
U||The king my uncle is to blame for this:
U||God will revenge it; whom I will importune
U||With daily prayers all to that effect.
U||Girl:
U||And so will I.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
U||Incapable and shallow innocents,
U||You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
U||Boy:
U||Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
U||Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
U||Devised impeachments to imprison him :
U||And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
U||And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
U||Bade me rely on him as on my father,
U||And he would love me dearly as his child.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
U||And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
U||He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
U||Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
U||Boy:
U||Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Ay, boy.
U||Boy:
U||I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
U||To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
U||I'll join with black despair against my soul,
U||And to myself become an enemy.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||What means this scene of rude impatience?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||To make an act of tragic violence:
U||Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
U||Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
U||Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
U||If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
U||That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
U||Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
U||To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
U||As I had title in thy noble husband!
U||I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
U||And lived by looking on his images:
U||But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
U||Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
U||And I for comfort have but one false glass,
U||Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
U||Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
U||And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
U||But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
U||And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
U||Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
U||Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
U||To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
U||Boy:
U||Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
U||How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
U||Girl:
U||Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
U||Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Give me no help in lamentation;
U||I am not barren to bring forth complaints
U||All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
U||That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
U||May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
U||Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
U||Children:
U||Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
U||Children:
U||What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Was never widow had so dear a loss!
U||Children:
U||Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Was never mother had so dear a loss!
U||Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
U||Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
U||She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
U||I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
U||These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
U||I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
U||Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
U||Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
U||And I will pamper it with lamentations.
U||DORSET:
U||Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
U||That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
U||In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
U||With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
U||Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
U||Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
U||For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
U||RIVERS:
U||Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
U||Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
U||Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
U||Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
U||And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
U||To wail the dimming of our shining star;
U||But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
U||Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
U||I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
U||I crave your blessing.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
U||Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
U||That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
U||Now cheer each other in each other's love
U||Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
U||We are to reap the harvest of his son.
U||The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
U||But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
U||Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
U||Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
U||Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
U||Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
U||RIVERS:
U||Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
U||The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
U||Which would be so much the more dangerous
U||By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
U||Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
U||And may direct his course as please himself,
U||As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
U||In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I hope the king made peace with all of us
U||And the compact is firm and true in me.
U||RIVERS:
U||And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
U||Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
U||To no apparent likelihood of breach,
U||Which haply by much company might be urged:
U||Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
U||That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
U||HASTINGS:
U||And so say I.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Then be it so; and go we to determine
U||Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
U||Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
U||To give your censures in this weighty business?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||With all our harts.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
U||For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
U||For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
U||As index to the story we late talk'd of,
U||To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||My other self, my counsel's consistory,
U||My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
U||I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
U||Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
U||First Citizen:
U||Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
U||Second Citizen:
U||I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
U||Hear you the news abroad?
U||First Citizen:
U||Ay, that the king is dead.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
U||I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
U||Third Citizen:
U||Neighbours, God speed!
U||First Citizen:
U||Give you good morrow, sir.
U||Third Citizen:
U||Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
U||Second Citizen:
U||Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
U||Third Citizen:
U||Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
U||First Citizen:
U||No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
U||Third Citizen:
U||Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
U||Second Citizen:
U||In him there is a hope of government,
U||That in his nonage council under him,
U||And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
U||No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
U||First Citizen:
U||So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
U||Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
U||Third Citizen:
U||Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
U||For then this land was famously enrich'd
U||With politic grave counsel; then the king
U||Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
U||First Citizen:
U||Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
U||Third Citizen:
U||Better it were they all came by the father,
U||Or by the father there were none at all;
U||For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
U||Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
U||O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
U||And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
U||And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
U||This sickly land might solace as before.
U||First Citizen:
U||Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
U||Third Citizen:
U||When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
U||When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
U||When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
U||Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
U||All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
U||'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
U||Second Citizen:
U||Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
U||Ye cannot reason almost with a man
U||That looks not heavily and full of fear.
U||Third Citizen:
U||Before the times of change, still is it so:
U||By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
U||Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
U||The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
U||But leave it all to God. whither away?
U||Second Citizen:
U||Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
U||Third Citizen:
U||And so was I: I'll bear you company.
U||ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
U||Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
U||At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
U||To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||I long with all my heart to see the prince:
U||I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||But I hear, no; they say my son of York
U||Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
U||YORK:
U||Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
U||YORK:
U||Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
U||My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
U||More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
U||Gloucester,
U||'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
U||And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
U||Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
U||In him that did object the same to thee;
U||He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
U||So long a-growing and so leisurely,
U||That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
U||ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
U||Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
U||YORK:
U||Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
U||I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
U||To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
U||YORK:
U||Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
U||That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
U||'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
U||Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
U||YORK:
U||Grandam, his nurse.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
U||YORK:
U||If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
U||ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
U||Good madam, be not angry with the child.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Pitchers have ears.
U||ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
U||Here comes a messenger. What news?
U||Messenger:
U||Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||How fares the prince?
U||Messenger:
U||Well, madam, and in health.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||What is thy news then?
U||Messenger:
U||Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
U||With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Who hath committed them?
U||Messenger:
U||The mighty dukes
U||Gloucester and Buckingham.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||For what offence?
U||Messenger:
U||The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
U||Why or for what these nobles were committed
U||Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
U||The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
U||Insulting tyranny begins to jet
U||Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
U||Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
U||I see, as in a map, the end of all.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
U||How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
U||My husband lost his life to get the crown;
U||And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
U||For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
U||And being seated, and domestic broils
U||Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
U||Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
U||Self against self: O, preposterous
U||And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
U||Or let me die, to look on death no more!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
U||Madam, farewell.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||I'll go along with you.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||You have no cause.
U||ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
U||My gracious lady, go;
U||And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
U||For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
U||The seal I keep: and so betide to me
U||As well I tender you and all of yours!
U||Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
U||The weary way hath made you melancholy.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
U||Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
U||I want more uncles here to welcome me.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
U||Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
U||Nor more can you distinguish of a man
U||Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
U||Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
U||Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
U||Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
U||But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
U||God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
U||Lord Mayor:
U||God bless your grace with health and happy days!
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
U||I thought my mother, and my brother York,
U||Would long ere this have met us on the way
U||Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
U||To tell us whether they will come or no!
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
U||HASTINGS:
U||On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
U||The queen your mother, and your brother York,
U||Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
U||Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
U||But by his mother was perforce withheld.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
U||Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
U||Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
U||Unto his princely brother presently?
U||If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
U||And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
U||CARDINAL:
U||My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
U||Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
U||Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
U||To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
U||We should infringe the holy privilege
U||Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
U||Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
U||Too ceremonious and traditional
U||Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
U||You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
U||The benefit thereof is always granted
U||To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
U||And those who have the wit to claim the place:
U||This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
U||And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
U||Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
U||You break no privilege nor charter there.
U||Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
U||But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
U||CARDINAL:
U||My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
U||Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
U||HASTINGS:
U||I go, my lord.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
U||Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
U||Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Where it seems best unto your royal self.
U||If I may counsel you, some day or two
U||Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
U||Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
U||For your best health and recreation.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||I do not like the Tower, of any place.
U||Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
U||Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||Is it upon record, or else reported
U||Successively from age to age, he built it?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Upon record, my gracious lord.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
U||Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
U||As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
U||Even to the general all-ending day.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||What say you, uncle?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I say, without characters, fame lives long.
U||Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
U||I moralize two meanings in one word.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
U||With what his valour did enrich his wit,
U||His wit set down to make his valour live
U||Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
U||For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
U||I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||What, my gracious lord?
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||An if I live until I be a man,
U||I'll win our ancient right in France again,
U||Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
U||YORK:
U||Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
U||Too late he died that might have kept that title,
U||Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
U||YORK:
U||I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
U||You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
U||The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||He hath, my lord.
U||YORK:
U||And therefore is he idle?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
U||YORK:
U||Then is he more beholding to you than I.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||He may command me as my sovereign;
U||But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
U||YORK:
U||I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||A beggar, brother?
U||YORK:
U||Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
U||And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
U||YORK:
U||A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
U||YORK:
U||O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
U||In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
U||YORK:
U||I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
U||YORK:
U||I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||How?
U||YORK:
U||Little.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
U||Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
U||YORK:
U||You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
U||Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
U||Because that I am little, like an ape,
U||He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
U||To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
U||He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
U||So cunning and so young is wonderful.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||My lord, will't please you pass along?
U||Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
U||Will to your mother, to entreat of her
U||To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
U||YORK:
U||What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||My lord protector needs will have it so.
U||YORK:
U||I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Why, what should you fear?
U||YORK:
U||Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
U||My grandam told me he was murdered there.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||I fear no uncles dead.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Nor none that live, I hope.
U||PRINCE EDWARD:
U||An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
U||But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
U||Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Think you, my lord, this little prating York
U||Was not incensed by his subtle mother
U||To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
U||Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
U||He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
U||Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
U||As closely to conceal what we impart:
U||Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
U||What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
U||To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
U||For the instalment of this noble duke
U||In the seat royal of this famous isle?
U||CATESBY:
U||He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
U||That he will not be won to aught against him.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
U||CATESBY:
U||He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
U||And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
U||How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
U||And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
U||To sit about the coronation.
U||If thou dost find him tractable to us,
U||Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
U||If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
U||Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
U||And give us notice of his inclination:
U||For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
U||Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
U||His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
U||To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
U||And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
U||Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
U||CATESBY:
U||My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
U||CATESBY:
U||You shall, my lord.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
U||Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
U||And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
U||The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
U||Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
U||Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
U||We may digest our complots in some form.
U||Messenger:
U||What, ho! my lord!
U||HASTINGS:
U||Messenger:
U||A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
U||HASTINGS:
U||What is't o'clock?
U||Messenger:
U||Upon the stroke of four.
U||HASTINGS:
U||Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
U||Messenger:
U||So it should seem by that I have to say.
U||First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
U||HASTINGS:
U||And then?
U||Messenger:
U||And then he sends you word
U||He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
U||Besides, he says there are two councils held;
U||And that may be determined at the one
U||which may make you and him to rue at the other.
U||Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
U||If presently you will take horse with him,
U||And with all speed post with him toward the north,
U||To shun the danger that his soul divines.
U||HASTINGS:
U||Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
U||Bid him not fear the separated councils
U||His honour and myself are at the one,
U||And at the other is my servant Catesby
U||Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
U||Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
U||Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
U||And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
U||To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
U||To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
U||Were to incense the boar to follow us
U||And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
U||Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
U||And we will both together to the Tower,
U||Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
U||Messenger:
U||My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
U||CATESBY:
U||Many good morrows to my noble lord!
U||HASTINGS:
U||Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
U||What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
U||CATESBY:
U||It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
U||And I believe twill never stand upright
U||Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
U||HASTINGS:
U||How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
U||CATESBY:
U||Ay, my good lord.
U||HASTINGS:
U||I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
U||Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
U||But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
U||CATESBY:
U||Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
U||Upon his party for the gain thereof:
U||And thereupon he sends you this good news,
U||That this same very day your enemies,
U||The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
U||HASTINGS:
U||Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
U||Because they have been still mine enemies:
U||But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
U||To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
U||God knows I will not do it, to the death.
U||CATESBY:
U||God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
U||HASTINGS:
U||But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
U||That they who brought me in my master's hate
U||I live to look upon their tragedy.
U||I tell thee, Catesby--
U||CATESBY:
U||What, my lord?
U||HASTINGS:
U||Ere a fortnight make me elder,
U||I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
U||CATESBY:
U||'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
U||When men are unprepared and look not for it.
U||HASTINGS:
U||O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
U||With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
U||With some men else, who think themselves as safe
U||As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
U||To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
U||CATESBY:
U||The princes both make high account of you;
U||For they account his head upon the bridge.
U||HASTINGS:
U||I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
U||Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
U||Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
U||STANLEY:
U||My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
U||You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
U||I do not like these several councils, I.
U||HASTINGS:
U||My lord,
U||I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
U||And never in my life, I do protest,
U||Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
U||Think you, but that I know our state secure,
U||I would be so triumphant as I am?
U||STANLEY:
U||The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
U||Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
U||And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
U||But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
U||This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
U||Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
U||What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
U||HASTINGS:
U||Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
U||To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
U||LORD STANLEY:
U||They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
U||Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
U||But come, my lord, let us away.
U||HASTINGS:
U||Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
U||How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
U||Pursuivant:
U||The better that your lordship please to ask.
U||HASTINGS:
U||I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
U||Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
U||Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
U||By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
U||But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
U||This day those enemies are put to death,
U||And I in better state than e'er I was.
U||Pursuivant:
U||God hold it, to your honour's good content!
U||HASTINGS:
U||Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
U||Pursuivant:
U||God save your lordship!
U||Priest:
U||Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
U||HASTINGS:
U||I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
U||I am in your debt for your last exercise;
U||Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
U||Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
U||Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
U||HASTINGS:
U||Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
U||Those men you talk of came into my mind.
U||What, go you toward the Tower?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
U||I shall return before your lordship thence.
U||HASTINGS:
U||'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||HASTINGS:
U||I'll wait upon your lordship.
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Come, bring forth the prisoners.
U||RIVERS:
U||Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
U||To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
U||For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
U||GREY:
U||God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
U||A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
U||VAUGHAN:
U||You live that shall cry woe for this after.
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
U||RIVERS:
U||O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
U||Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
U||Within the guilty closure of thy walls
U||Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
U||And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
U||We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
U||GREY:
U||Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
U||For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
U||RIVERS:
U||Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
U||Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
U||To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
U||And for my sister and her princely sons,
U||Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
U||Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
U||RIVERS:
U||Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
U||And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
U||HASTINGS:
U||My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
U||Is, to determine of the coronation.
U||In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Are all things fitting for that royal time?
U||DERBY:
U||It is, and wants but nomination.
U||BISHOP OF ELY:
U||To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
U||Who is most inward with the royal duke?
U||BISHOP OF ELY:
U||Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
U||But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
U||Than I of yours;
U||Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
U||Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
U||HASTINGS:
U||I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
U||But, for his purpose in the coronation.
U||I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
U||His gracious pleasure any way therein:
U||But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
U||And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
U||Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
U||BISHOP OF ELY:
U||Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
U||I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
U||My absence doth neglect no great designs,
U||Which by my presence might have been concluded.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
U||William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
U||I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
U||His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
U||HASTINGS:
U||I thank your grace.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||My lord of Ely!
U||BISHOP OF ELY:
U||My lord?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||When I was last in Holborn,
U||I saw good strawberries in your garden there
U||I do beseech you send for some of them.
U||BISHOP OF ELY:
U||Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
U||Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
U||And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
U||As he will lose his head ere give consent
U||His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
U||Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
U||DERBY:
U||We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
U||To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
U||For I myself am not so well provided
U||As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
U||BISHOP OF ELY:
U||Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
U||strawberries.
U||HASTINGS:
U||His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
U||There's some conceit or other likes him well,
U||When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
U||I think there's never a man in Christendom
U||That can less hide his love or hate than he;
U||For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
U||DERBY:
U||What of his heart perceive you in his face
U||By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
U||HASTINGS:
U||Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
U||For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
U||DERBY:
U||I pray God he be not, I say.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
U||That do conspire my death with devilish plots
U||Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
U||Upon my body with their hellish charms?
U||HASTINGS:
U||The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
U||Makes me most forward in this noble presence
U||To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
U||I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
U||See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
U||Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
U||And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
U||Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
U||That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
U||HASTINGS:
U||If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
U||Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
U||Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
U||I will not dine until I see the same.
U||Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
U||The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
U||HASTINGS:
U||Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
U||For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
U||Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
U||But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
U||Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
U||And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
U||As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
U||O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
U||I now repent I told the pursuivant
U||As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
U||How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
U||And I myself secure in grace and favour.
U||O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
U||Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
U||Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
U||HASTINGS:
U||O momentary grace of mortal men,
U||Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
U||Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
U||Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
U||Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
U||Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
U||LOVEL:
U||Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
U||HASTINGS:
U||O bloody Richard! miserable England!
U||I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
U||That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
U||Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
U||They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
U||Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
U||And then begin again, and stop again,
U||As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
U||Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
U||Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
U||Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
U||Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
U||And both are ready in their offices,
U||At any time, to grace my stratagems.
U||But what, is Catesby gone?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Lord mayor,--
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Look to the drawbridge there!
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Hark! a drum.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||God and our innocency defend and guard us!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
U||LOVEL:
U||Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
U||The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
U||I took him for the plainest harmless creature
U||That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
U||Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
U||The history of all her secret thoughts:
U||So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
U||That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
U||I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
U||He lived from all attainder of suspect.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
U||That ever lived.
U||Would you imagine, or almost believe,
U||Were't not that, by great preservation,
U||We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
U||This day had plotted, in the council-house
U||To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
U||Lord Mayor:
U||What, had he so?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
U||Or that we would, against the form of law,
U||Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
U||But that the extreme peril of the case,
U||The peace of England and our persons' safety,
U||Enforced us to this execution?
U||Lord Mayor:
U||Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
U||And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
U||To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
U||I never look'd for better at his hands,
U||After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Yet had not we determined he should die,
U||Until your lordship came to see his death;
U||Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
U||Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
U||Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
U||The traitor speak, and timorously confess
U||The manner and the purpose of his treason;
U||That you might well have signified the same
U||Unto the citizens, who haply may
U||Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
U||Lord Mayor:
U||But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
U||As well as I had seen and heard him speak
U||And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
U||But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
U||With all your just proceedings in this cause.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
U||To avoid the carping censures of the world.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||But since you come too late of our intents,
U||Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
U||And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
U||The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
U||There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
U||Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
U||Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
U||Only for saying he would make his son
U||Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
U||Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
U||Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
U||And bestial appetite in change of lust;
U||Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
U||Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
U||Without control, listed to make his prey.
U||Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
U||Tell them, when that my mother went with child
U||Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
U||My princely father then had wars in France
U||And, by just computation of the time,
U||Found that the issue was not his begot;
U||Which well appeared in his lineaments,
U||Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
U||But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
U||Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
U||As if the golden fee for which I plead
U||Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
U||Where you shall find me well accompanied
U||With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||I go: and towards three or four o'clock
U||Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
U||Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
U||Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
U||Now will I in, to take some privy order,
U||To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
U||And to give notice, that no manner of person
U||At any time have recourse unto the princes.
U||Scrivener:
U||This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
U||Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
U||That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
U||And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
U||Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
U||For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
U||The precedent was full as long a-doing:
U||And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
U||Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
U||Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
U||That seeth not this palpable device?
U||Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
U||Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
U||When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
U||The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
U||And his contract by deputy in France;
U||The insatiate greediness of his desires,
U||And his enforcement of the city wives;
U||His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
U||As being got, your father then in France,
U||His resemblance, being not like the duke;
U||Withal I did infer your lineaments,
U||Being the right idea of your father,
U||Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
U||Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
U||Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
U||Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
U||Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
U||Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
U||And when mine oratory grew to an end
U||I bid them that did love their country's good
U||Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Ah! and did they so?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
U||But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
U||Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
U||Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
U||And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
U||His answer was, the people were not wont
U||To be spoke to but by the recorder.
U||Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
U||'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
U||But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
U||When he had done, some followers of mine own,
U||At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
U||And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
U||And thus I took the vantage of those few,
U||'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
U||'This general applause and loving shout
U||Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
U||And even here brake off, and came away.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||No, by my troth, my lord.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
U||Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
U||And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
U||And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
U||For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
U||And be not easily won to our request:
U||Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I go; and if you plead as well for them
U||As I can say nay to thee for myself,
U||No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
U||Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
U||I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
U||Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
U||What says he?
U||CATESBY:
U||My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
U||To visit him to-morrow or next day:
U||He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
U||Divinely bent to meditation;
U||And no worldly suit would he be moved,
U||To draw him from his holy exercise.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
U||Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
U||In deep designs and matters of great moment,
U||No less importing than our general good,
U||Are come to have some conference with his grace.
U||CATESBY:
U||I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
U||He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
U||But on his knees at meditation;
U||Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
U||But meditating with two deep divines;
U||Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
U||But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
U||Happy were England, would this gracious prince
U||Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
U||But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.
U||Lord Mayor:
U||Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||I fear he will.
U||How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
U||CATESBY:
U||My lord,
U||He wonders to what end you have assembled
U||Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
U||His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
U||My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Sorry I am my noble cousin should
U||Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
U||By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
U||And so once more return and tell his grace.
U||When holy and devout religious men
U||Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
U||So sweet is zealous contemplation.
U||Lord Mayor:
U||See, where he stands between two clergymen!
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
U||To stay him from the fall of vanity:
U||And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
U||True ornaments to know a holy man.
U||Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
U||Lend favourable ears to our request;
U||And pardon us the interruption
U||Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||My lord, there needs no such apology:
U||I rather do beseech you pardon me,
U||Who, earnest in the service of my God,
U||Neglect the visitation of my friends.
U||But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
U||And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I do suspect I have done some offence
U||That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
U||And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
U||At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Then know, it is your fault that you resign
U||The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
U||The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
U||Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
U||The lineal glory of your royal house,
U||To the corruption of a blemished stock:
U||Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
U||Which here we waken to our country's good,
U||This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
U||Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
U||Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
U||And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
U||Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
U||Which to recure, we heartily solicit
U||Your gracious self to take on you the charge
U||And kingly government of this your land,
U||Not as protector, steward, substitute,
U||Or lowly factor for another's gain;
U||But as successively from blood to blood,
U||Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
U||For this, consorted with the citizens,
U||Your very worshipful and loving friends,
U||And by their vehement instigation,
U||In this just suit come I to move your grace.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||I know not whether to depart in silence,
U||Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
U||Best fitteth my degree or your condition
U||If not to answer, you might haply think
U||Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
U||To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
U||Which fondly you would here impose on me;
U||If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
U||So season'd with your faithful love to me.
U||Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
U||Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
U||And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
U||Definitively thus I answer you.
U||Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
U||Unmeritable shuns your high request.
U||First if all obstacles were cut away,
U||And that my path were even to the crown,
U||As my ripe revenue and due by birth
U||Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
U||So mighty and so many my defects,
U||As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
U||Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
U||Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
U||And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
U||But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
U||And much I need to help you, if need were;
U||The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
U||Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
U||Will well become the seat of majesty,
U||And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
U||On him I lay what you would lay on me,
U||The right and fortune of his happy stars;
U||Which God defend that I should wring from him!
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
U||But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
U||All circumstances well considered.
U||You say that Edward is your brother's son:
U||So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
U||For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
U||Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
U||And afterward by substitute betroth'd
U||To Bona, sister to the King of France.
U||These both put by a poor petitioner,
U||A care-crazed mother of a many children,
U||A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
U||Even in the afternoon of her best days,
U||Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
U||Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
U||To base declension and loathed bigamy
U||By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
U||This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
U||More bitterly could I expostulate,
U||Save that, for reverence to some alive,
U||I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
U||Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
U||This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
U||If non to bless us and the land withal,
U||Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
U||From the corruption of abusing times,
U||Unto a lineal true-derived course.
U||Lord Mayor:
U||Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
U||CATESBY:
U||O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
U||I am unfit for state and majesty;
U||I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
U||I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
U||Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
U||As well we know your tenderness of heart
U||And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
U||Which we have noted in you to your kin,
U||And egally indeed to all estates,--
U||Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
U||Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
U||But we will plant some other in the throne,
U||To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
U||And in this resolution here we leave you.--
U||Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
U||CATESBY:
U||Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
U||ANOTHER:
U||Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Would you enforce me to a world of care?
U||Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
U||But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
U||Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
U||Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
U||Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
U||To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
U||I must have patience to endure the load:
U||But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
U||Attend the sequel of your imposition,
U||Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
U||From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
U||For God he knows, and you may partly see,
U||How far I am from the desire thereof.
U||Lord Mayor:
U||God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Then I salute you with this kingly title:
U||Long live Richard, England's royal king!
U||Lord Mayor:
U||Amen.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Even when you please, since you will have it so.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
U||And so most joyfully we take our leave.
U||GLOUCESTER:
U||Come, let us to our holy task again.
U||Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
U||Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
U||Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
U||On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
U||Daughter, well met.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||God give your graces both
U||A happy and a joyful time of day!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
U||LADY ANNE:
U||No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
U||Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
U||To gratulate the gentle princes there.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
U||And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
U||Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
U||How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
U||I may not suffer you to visit them;
U||The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||The king! why, who's that?
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
U||Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
U||I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
U||Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
U||And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
U||BRAKENBURY:
U||No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
U||I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
U||LORD STANLEY:
U||Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
U||And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
U||And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
U||Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
U||There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
U||May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
U||With this dead-killing news!
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
U||DORSET:
U||Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
U||Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
U||Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
U||If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
U||And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
U||Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
U||Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
U||And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
U||Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
U||LORD STANLEY:
U||Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
U||Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
U||You shall have letters from me to my son
U||To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
U||Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
U||O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
U||A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
U||Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
U||LORD STANLEY:
U||Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||And I in all unwillingness will go.
U||I would to God that the inclusive verge
U||Of golden metal that must round my brow
U||Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
U||Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
U||And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
U||To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||No! why?  When he that is my husband now
U||Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
U||When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
U||Which issued from my other angel husband
U||And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
U||O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
U||This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
U||For making me, so young, so old a widow!
U||And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
U||And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
U||As miserable by the life of thee
U||As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
U||Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
U||Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
U||Grossly grew captive to his honey words
U||And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
U||Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
U||For never yet one hour in his bed
U||Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
U||But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
U||Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
U||And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
U||LADY ANNE:
U||No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
U||LADY ANNE:
U||Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
U||Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
U||Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
U||Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
U||Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
U||For tender princes, use my babies well!
U||So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||My gracious sovereign?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Give me thy hand.
U||Thus high, by thy advice
U||And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
U||But shall we wear these honours for a day?
U||Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Still live they and for ever may they last!
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
U||To try if thou be current gold indeed
U||Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Say on, my loving lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||True, noble prince.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||O bitter consequence,
U||That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
U||Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
U||Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
U||And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
U||What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Your grace may do your pleasure.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
U||Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
U||Before I positively herein:
U||I will resolve your grace immediately.
U||CATESBY:
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||I will converse with iron-witted fools
U||And unrespective boys: none are for me
U||That look into me with considerate eyes:
U||High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
U||Boy!
U||Page:
U||My lord?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
U||Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
U||Page:
U||My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
U||Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
U||Gold were as good as twenty orators,
U||And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||What is his name?
U||Page:
U||His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
U||The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
U||No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
U||Hath he so long held out with me untired,
U||And stops he now for breath?
U||How now! what news with you?
U||STANLEY:
U||My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
U||To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
U||Where he abides.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Catesby!
U||CATESBY:
U||My lord?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Rumour it abroad
U||That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
U||I will take order for her keeping close.
U||Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
U||Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
U||The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
U||Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
U||That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
U||About it; for it stands me much upon,
U||To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
U||I must be married to my brother's daughter,
U||Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
U||Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
U||Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
U||So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
U||Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
U||Is thy name Tyrrel?
U||TYRREL:
U||James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Art thou, indeed?
U||TYRREL:
U||Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
U||TYRREL:
U||Ay, my lord;
U||But I had rather kill two enemies.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
U||Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
U||Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
U||Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
U||TYRREL:
U||Let me have open means to come to them,
U||And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
U||Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
U||There is no more but so: say it is done,
U||And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
U||TYRREL:
U||'Tis done, my gracious lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
U||TYRREL:
U||Ye shall, my Lord.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
U||The late demand that you did sound me in.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||I hear that news, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
U||For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
U||The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
U||The which you promised I should possess.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
U||Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||What says your highness to my just demand?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||As I remember, Henry the Sixth
U||Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
U||When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
U||A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||My lord!
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||How chance the prophet could not at that time
U||Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
U||The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
U||And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
U||Because a bard of Ireland told me once
U||I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||My Lord!
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Ay, what's o'clock?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
U||Of what you promised me.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Well, but what's o'clock?
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Upon the stroke of ten.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Well, let it strike.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Why let it strike?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
U||Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
U||I am not in the giving vein to-day.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Tut, tut,
U||Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Is it even so? rewards he my true service
U||With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
U||O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
U||To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
U||TYRREL:
U||The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
U||The most arch of piteous massacre
U||That ever yet this land was guilty of.
U||Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
U||To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
U||Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
U||Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
U||Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
U||'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
U||'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
U||Within their innocent alabaster arms:
U||Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
U||Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
U||A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
U||Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
U||But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
U||Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
U||The most replenished sweet work of nature,
U||That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
U||Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
U||They could not speak; and so I left them both,
U||To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
U||And here he comes.
U||All hail, my sovereign liege!
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
U||TYRREL:
U||If to have done the thing you gave in charge
U||Beget your happiness, be happy then,
U||For it is done, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||But didst thou see them dead?
U||TYRREL:
U||I did, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
U||TYRREL:
U||The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
U||But how or in what place I do not know.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
U||And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
U||Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
U||And be inheritor of thy desire.
U||Farewell till soon.
U||The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
U||His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
U||The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
U||And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
U||Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
U||At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
U||And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
U||To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
U||CATESBY:
U||My lord!
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
U||CATESBY:
U||Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
U||And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
U||Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
U||Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
U||Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
U||Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
U||Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
U||Then fiery expedition be my wing,
U||Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
U||Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
U||We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||So, now prosperity begins to mellow
U||And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
U||Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
U||To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
U||A dire induction am I witness to,
U||And will to France, hoping the consequence
U||Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
U||Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
U||My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
U||If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
U||And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
U||Hover about me with your airy wings
U||And hear your mother's lamentation!
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Hover about her; say, that right for right
U||Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||So many miseries have crazed my voice,
U||That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
U||Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
U||Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
U||And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
U||When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
U||Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
U||Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
U||Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
U||Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
U||As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
U||Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
U||O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
U||Give mine the benefit of seniory,
U||And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
U||If sorrow can admit society,
U||Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
U||I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
U||I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
U||Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
U||Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
U||I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
U||From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
U||A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
U||That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
U||To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
U||That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
U||That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
U||That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
U||Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
U||O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
U||How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
U||Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
U||And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
U||God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
U||And now I cloy me with beholding it.
U||Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
U||Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
U||Young York he is but boot, because both they
U||Match not the high perfection of my loss:
U||Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
U||And the beholders of this tragic play,
U||The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
U||Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
U||Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
U||Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
U||And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
U||Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
U||Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
U||To have him suddenly convey'd away.
U||Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
U||That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
U||That I should wish for thee to help me curse
U||That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
U||I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
U||The presentation of but what I was;
U||The flattering index of a direful pageant;
U||One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
U||A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
U||A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
U||A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
U||To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
U||A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
U||Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
U||Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
U||Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
U||Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
U||Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
U||Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
U||For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
U||For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
U||For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
U||For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
U||For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
U||For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
U||For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
U||Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
U||And left thee but a very prey to time;
U||Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
U||To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
U||Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
U||Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
U||Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
U||From which even here I slip my weary neck,
U||And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
U||Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
U||These English woes will make me smile in France.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
U||And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
U||Compare dead happiness with living woe;
U||Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
U||And he that slew them fouler than he is:
U||Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
U||Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
U||QUEEN MARGARET:
U||Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Why should calamity be full of words?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Windy attorneys to their client woes,
U||Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
U||Poor breathing orators of miseries!
U||Let them have scope: though what they do impart
U||Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
U||And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
U||My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
U||I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Who intercepts my expedition?
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||O, she that might have intercepted thee,
U||By strangling thee in her accursed womb
U||From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
U||Where should be graven, if that right were right,
U||The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
U||And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
U||Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
U||And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
U||Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
U||Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
U||Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
U||Or with the clamorous report of war
U||Thus will I drown your exclamations.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Art thou my son?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Then patiently hear my impatience.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
U||Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||O, let me speak!
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Do then: but I'll not hear.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
U||God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||And came I not at last to comfort you?
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
U||Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
U||A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
U||Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
U||Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
U||Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
U||Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
U||treacherous,
U||More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
U||What comfortable hour canst thou name,
U||That ever graced me in thy company?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
U||your grace
U||To breakfast once forth of my company.
U||If I be so disgracious in your sight,
U||Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
U||Strike the drum.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||I prithee, hear me speak.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||You speak too bitterly.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Hear me a word;
U||For I shall never speak to thee again.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||So.
U||DUCHESS OF YORK:
U||Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
U||Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
U||Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
U||And never look upon thy face again.
U||Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
U||Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
U||Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
U||My prayers on the adverse party fight;
U||And there the little souls of Edward's children
U||Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
U||And promise them success and victory.
U||Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
U||Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
U||Abides in me; I say amen to all.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||I have no more sons of the royal blood
U||For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
U||They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
U||And therefore level not to hit their lives.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
U||Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||And must she die for this? O, let her live,
U||And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
U||Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
U||Throw over her the veil of infamy:
U||So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
U||I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Her life is only safest in her birth.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||And only in that safety died her brothers.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
U||My babes were destined to a fairer death,
U||If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
U||Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
U||Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
U||Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
U||No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
U||Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
U||To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
U||But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
U||My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
U||Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
U||And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
U||Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
U||Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
U||And dangerous success of bloody wars,
U||As I intend more good to you and yours,
U||Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
U||To be discover'd, that can do me good?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||No, to the dignity and height of honour
U||The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
U||Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
U||Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
U||Will I withal endow a child of thine;
U||So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
U||Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
U||Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
U||Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||What do you think?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
U||So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
U||And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
U||I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
U||And mean to make her queen of England.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||What, thou?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||How canst thou woo her?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||That would I learn of you,
U||As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||And wilt thou learn of me?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Madam, with all my heart.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
U||A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
U||Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
U||Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
U||Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
U||A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
U||The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
U||And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
U||If this inducement force her not to love,
U||Send her a story of thy noble acts;
U||Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
U||Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
U||Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
U||To win our daughter.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||There is no other way
U||Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
U||And not be Richard that hath done all this.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Say that I did all this for love of her.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
U||Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
U||Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
U||Which after hours give leisure to repent.
U||If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
U||To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
U||If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
U||To quicken your increase, I will beget
U||Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
U||A grandam's name is little less in love
U||Than is the doting title of a mother;
U||They are as children but one step below,
U||Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
U||Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
U||Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
U||Your children were vexation to your youth,
U||But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
U||The loss you have is but a son being king,
U||And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
U||I cannot make you what amends I would,
U||Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
U||Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
U||Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
U||This fair alliance quickly shall call home
U||To high promotions and great dignity:
U||The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
U||Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
U||Again shall you be mother to a king,
U||And all the ruins of distressful times
U||Repair'd with double riches of content.
U||What! we have many goodly days to see:
U||The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
U||Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
U||Advantaging their loan with interest
U||Of ten times double gain of happiness.
U||Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
U||Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
U||Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
U||Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
U||Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
U||With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
U||And when this arm of mine hath chastised
U||The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
U||Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
U||And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
U||To whom I will retail my conquest won,
U||And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||What were I best to say? her father's brother
U||Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
U||Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
U||Under what title shall I woo for thee,
U||That God, the law, my honour and her love,
U||Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Say, I will love her everlastingly.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
U||Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||I swear--
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||By nothing; for this is no oath:
U||The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
U||The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
U||The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
U||if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
U||Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Now, by the world--
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||My father's death--
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Then, by myself--
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Thyself thyself misusest.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Why then, by God--
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||God's wrong is most of all.
U||If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
U||The unity the king thy brother made
U||Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
U||If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
U||The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
U||Had graced the tender temples of my child,
U||And both the princes had been breathing here,
U||Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
U||Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
U||What canst thou swear by now?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||The time to come.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
U||For I myself have many tears to wash
U||Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
U||The children live, whose parents thou hast
U||slaughter'd,
U||Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
U||The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
U||Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
U||Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
U||Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||As I intend to prosper and repent,
U||So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
U||Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
U||Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
U||Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
U||Be opposite all planets of good luck
U||To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
U||Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
U||I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
U||In her consists my happiness and thine;
U||Without her, follows to this land and me,
U||To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
U||Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
U||It cannot be avoided but by this;
U||It will not be avoided but by this.
U||Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
U||Be the attorney of my love to her:
U||Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
U||Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
U||Urge the necessity and state of times,
U||And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Shall I forget myself to be myself?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||But thou didst kill my children.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
U||Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
U||Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||And be a happy mother by the deed.
U||QUEEN ELIZABETH:
U||I go. Write to me very shortly.
U||And you shall understand from me her mind.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
U||Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
U||How now! what news?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
U||Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
U||Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
U||Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
U||'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
U||And there they hull, expecting but the aid
U||Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
U||Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
U||CATESBY:
U||Here, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Fly to the duke:
U||Post thou to Salisbury
U||When thou comest thither--
U||Dull, unmindful villain,
U||Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
U||CATESBY:
U||First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
U||What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
U||The greatest strength and power he can make,
U||And meet me presently at Salisbury.
U||CATESBY:
U||I go.
U||RATCLIFF:
U||What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
U||Salisbury?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Your highness told me I should post before.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
U||How now, what news with you?
U||STANLEY:
U||None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
U||Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
U||Why dost thou run so many mile about,
U||When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
U||Once more, what news?
U||STANLEY:
U||Richmond is on the seas.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
U||White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
U||STANLEY:
U||I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
U||STANLEY:
U||Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
U||He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
U||Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
U||What heir of York is there alive but we?
U||And who is England's king but great York's heir?
U||Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
U||STANLEY:
U||Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
U||You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
U||Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
U||STANLEY:
U||No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
U||Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
U||Are they not now upon the western shore.
U||Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
U||STANLEY:
U||No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
U||When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
U||STANLEY:
U||They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
U||Please it your majesty to give me leave,
U||I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
U||Where and what time your majesty shall please.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
U||I will not trust you, sir.
U||STANLEY:
U||Most mighty sovereign,
U||You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
U||I never was nor never will be false.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Well,
U||Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
U||Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
U||Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
U||STANLEY:
U||So deal with him as I prove true to you.
U||Messenger:
U||My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
U||As I by friends am well advertised,
U||Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
U||Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
U||With many more confederates, are in arms.
U||Second Messenger:
U||My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
U||And every hour more competitors
U||Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.
U||Third Messenger:
U||My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
U||Take that, until thou bring me better news.
U||Third Messenger:
U||The news I have to tell your majesty
U||Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
U||Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
U||And he himself wander'd away alone,
U||No man knows whither.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||I cry thee mercy:
U||There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
U||Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
U||Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
U||Third Messenger:
U||Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
U||Fourth Messenger:
U||Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
U||'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
U||Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
U||The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
U||Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
U||Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
U||If they were his assistants, yea or no;
U||Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
U||Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
U||Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
U||If not to fight with foreign enemies,
U||Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
U||CATESBY:
U||My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
U||That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
U||Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
U||Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
U||A royal battle might be won and lost
U||Some one take order Buckingham be brought
U||To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
U||DERBY:
U||Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
U||That in the sty of this most bloody boar
U||My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
U||If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
U||The fear of that withholds my present aid.
U||But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
U||CHRISTOPHER:
U||At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
U||DERBY:
U||What men of name resort to him?
U||CHRISTOPHER:
U||Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
U||Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
U||Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
U||And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
U||And many more of noble fame and worth:
U||And towards London they do bend their course,
U||If by the way they be not fought withal.
U||DERBY:
U||Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
U||Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
U||He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
U||These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
U||Sheriff:
U||No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
U||Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
U||Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
U||By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
U||If that your moody discontented souls
U||Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
U||Even for revenge mock my destruction!
U||This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
U||Sheriff:
U||It is, my lord.
U||BUCKINGHAM:
U||Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
U||This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
U||I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
U||False to his children or his wife's allies
U||This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
U||By the false faith of him I trusted most;
U||This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
U||Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
U||That high All-Seer that I dallied with
U||Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
U||And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
U||Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
U||To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
U||Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
U||'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
U||Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
U||Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
U||Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
U||RICHMOND:
U||Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
U||Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
U||Thus far into the bowels of the land
U||Have we march'd on without impediment;
U||And here receive we from our father Stanley
U||Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
U||The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
U||That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
U||Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
U||In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
U||Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
U||Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
U||From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
U||In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
U||To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
U||By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
U||OXFORD:
U||Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
U||To fight against that bloody homicide.
U||HERBERT:
U||I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
U||BLUNT:
U||He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
U||Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
U||RICHMOND:
U||All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
U||True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
U||Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
U||My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
U||SURREY:
U||My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||My Lord of Norfolk,--
U||NORFOLK:
U||Here, most gracious liege.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
U||NORFOLK:
U||We must both give and take, my gracious lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
U||But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
U||Who hath descried the number of the foe?
U||NORFOLK:
U||Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Why, our battalion trebles that account:
U||Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
U||Which they upon the adverse party want.
U||Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
U||Let us survey the vantage of the field
U||Call for some men of sound direction
U||Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
U||For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
U||RICHMOND:
U||The weary sun hath made a golden set,
U||And by the bright track of his fiery car,
U||Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
U||Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
U||Give me some ink and paper in my tent
U||I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
U||Limit each leader to his several charge,
U||And part in just proportion our small strength.
U||My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
U||And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
U||The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
U||Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
U||And by the second hour in the morning
U||Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
U||Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
U||Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
U||BLUNT:
U||Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
U||Which well I am assured I have not done,
U||His regiment lies half a mile at least
U||South from the mighty power of the king.
U||RICHMOND:
U||If without peril it be possible,
U||Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
U||And give him from me this most needful scroll.
U||BLUNT:
U||Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
U||And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
U||RICHMOND:
U||Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
U||Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
U||In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||What is't o'clock?
U||CATESBY:
U||It's supper-time, my lord;
U||It's nine o'clock.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||I will not sup to-night.
U||Give me some ink and paper.
U||What, is my beaver easier than it was?
U||And all my armour laid into my tent?
U||CATESBY:
U||If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
U||Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
U||NORFOLK:
U||I go, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
U||NORFOLK:
U||I warrant you, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Catesby!
U||CATESBY:
U||My lord?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Send out a pursuivant at arms
U||To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
U||Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
U||Into the blind cave of eternal night.
U||Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
U||Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
U||Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
U||Ratcliff!
U||RATCLIFF:
U||My lord?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
U||Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
U||Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
U||I have not that alacrity of spirit,
U||Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
U||Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||It is, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Bid my guard watch; leave me.
U||Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
U||And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
U||DERBY:
U||Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
U||RICHMOND:
U||All comfort that the dark night can afford
U||Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
U||Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
U||DERBY:
U||I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
U||Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
U||So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
U||And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
U||In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
U||Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
U||And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
U||Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
U||I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
U||With best advantage will deceive the time,
U||And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
U||But on thy side I may not be too forward
U||Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
U||Be executed in his father's sight.
U||Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
U||Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
U||And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
U||Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
U||God give us leisure for these rites of love!
U||Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
U||RICHMOND:
U||Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
U||I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
U||Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
U||When I should mount with wings of victory:
U||Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
U||O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
U||Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
U||Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
U||That they may crush down with a heavy fall
U||The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
U||Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
U||That we may praise thee in the victory!
U||To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
U||Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
U||Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
U||Ghost of Prince Edward:
U||Ghost of King Henry VI:
U||Ghost of CLARENCE:
U||Ghost of RIVERS:
U||Ghost of GREY:
U||Ghost of VAUGHAN:
U||All:

U||Ghosts of young Princes:
U||Ghost of LADY ANNE:
U||Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
U||Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
U||O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
U||The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
U||Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
U||What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
U||Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
U||Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
U||Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
U||Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
U||Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
U||That I myself have done unto myself?
U||O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
U||For hateful deeds committed by myself!
U||I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
U||Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
U||My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
U||And every tongue brings in a several tale,
U||And every tale condemns me for a villain.
U||Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
U||Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
U||All several sins, all used in each degree,
U||Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
U||I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
U||And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
U||Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
U||Find in myself no pity to myself?
U||Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
U||Came to my tent; and every one did threat
U||To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
U||RATCLIFF:
U||My lord!
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||'Zounds! who is there?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
U||Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
U||Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
U||What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||No doubt, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
U||Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
U||Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
U||Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
U||It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
U||Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
U||To see if any mean to shrink from me.
U||LORDS:
U||Good morrow, Richmond!
U||RICHMOND:
U||Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
U||That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
U||LORDS:
U||How have you slept, my lord?
U||RICHMOND:
U||The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
U||That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
U||Have I since your departure had, my lords.
U||Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
U||Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
U||I promise you, my soul is very jocund
U||In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
U||How far into the morning is it, lords?
U||LORDS:
U||Upon the stroke of four.
U||RICHMOND:
U||Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
U||More than I have said, loving countrymen,
U||The leisure and enforcement of the time
U||Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
U||God and our good cause fight upon our side;
U||The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
U||Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
U||Richard except, those whom we fight against
U||Had rather have us win than him they follow:
U||For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
U||A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
U||One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
U||One that made means to come by what he hath,
U||And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
U||Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
U||Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
U||One that hath ever been God's enemy:
U||Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
U||God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
U||If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
U||You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
U||If you do fight against your country's foes,
U||Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
U||If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
U||Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
U||If you do free your children from the sword,
U||Your children's children quit it in your age.
U||Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
U||Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
U||For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
U||Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
U||But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
U||The least of you shall share his part thereof.
U||Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
U||God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||That he was never trained up in arms.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
U||Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
U||Who saw the sun to-day?
U||RATCLIFF:
U||Not I, my lord.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
U||He should have braved the east an hour ago
U||A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
U||RATCLIFF:
U||My lord?
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||The sun will not be seen to-day;
U||The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
U||I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
U||Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
U||More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
U||That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
U||NORFOLK:
U||Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
U||KING RICHARD III:
U||Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
U||Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
U||I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
U||And thus my battle shall be ordered:
U||My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
U||Consisting equally of horse and foot;
U||Our archers shall be placed in the midst
U||John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
U||Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
U||They thus directed, we will follow
U||In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
U||Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
U||This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
U||NORFOLK:
U||A good direction, warlike sovereign.
