# 🧠 Coldmetal.c™ — Demo Vault

This folder is a visual artifact archive from the development of Coldmetal.c — a proprietary offline AI system built in C.

Coldmetal is not a chatbot.  
It is a semantic recall engine.  
What you see here is not output — it is memory.

---

## 📁 `hallucinations/`

Snapshots of Coldmetal recalling text with poetic or unintended precision.

- **Hallucination.png** — Coldmetal responds to emotional prompts with Shakespearean threats and accusations. Memory vector triggered Othello-like recall.

---

## 📁 `phase-01/`

This folder tracks Coldmetal’s first evolutionary phase — memory embedding, semantic lookup, and vector scoring.

- **coldmetal-phase3.png** — Terminal snapshot from vector-based memory recall engine in live use.
- **coldmetal.c.png** — Early code structuring: tokenizer, embedder, forward pass engine.
- **data-trained.png** — Memory `.mem` file bank with real-time updates.
- **just-an-echo.png** — Pre-training behavior: Coldmetal still echoing instead of reasoning.
- **math.png** — Snapshot of `math.c`, cosine similarity engine for attention scoring.
- **small-progress.png** — First successful score-based response retrieval.
- **struggle.png** — Coldmetal failing to reason, highlighting limits of static recall.
- **50mb-one-shot.png** — Single vector batch result from compressed semantic archive.

## 📁 `videos/`

Short terminal recordings and walkthroughs of Coldmetal training, inference, and memory activity.

- **phase-03-video.mp4** — Weight training loop running across `.mem` files.
- **phase-03-video.webm** — Coldmetal responding in real-time with updated memory weights.
