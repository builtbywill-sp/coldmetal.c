### Morpheus — Phase 3: Interactive Recall & Response
Summary

Phase 3 unlocks live memory utilization within the REPL. Morpheus now compares user input to embedded memories and responds based on vector similarity, drawing from trained .mem files. Responses are embedded and stored, creating a continuous feedback loop.
### 🧠 Capabilities Introduced

    Live embedding of user input

    Cosine similarity comparison against all memory vectors

    Dynamic response generation based on match score

    Buffer-aware memory selection to avoid repeats

    User inputs and replies saved to morpheus.mem for continuity

### 🛠️ Core Components

    main.c — upgraded Morpheus REPL loop

    attention.[ch] — cosine similarity scoring

    memory.[ch] — memory vector access and buffering

    embedder.[ch] — full sentence embedding

    math.[ch] — vector norm + normalization helpers

### 🧪 Output

Interactive CLI where user input is compared against prior training data and Morpheus generates live responses from vector matches. Responses are semantically derived — not echo-based.
🔭 Next Steps

    Introduce prompt abstraction (e.g. mood, tone, persona filters)

    Allow runtime memory suppression or isolation (e.g. ignore specific .mem files)

    Add response variation using vector neighbors

    Create a memory visualizer (memgraph.c) to audit response weight and trace similarity paths
