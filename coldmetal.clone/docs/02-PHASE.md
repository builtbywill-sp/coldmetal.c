## Morpheus — Phase 2: Core Memory Training
Summary

## Phase 2 
establishes the training pipeline by converting raw text files into embedded memory vectors. These .mem files are used by Morpheus to simulate semantic recall and memory-based inference during runtime.

## Core Components

    Trainer (trainer.c) for ingestion

    Embedder (embedder.[ch]) for token-to-vector mapping

    Memory handler (memory.[ch]) for loading and access

    Memory files (*.mem) for persistent recall

## Files Introduced

    trainer.c

    data/data-archive/*.txt

    data/.mem/*.mem

## Directory Structure

/data
  ├── data-archive/       # Raw input files
  │     ├── tiny-poe.txt
  │     └── tiny-shakespeare.txt
  ├── .mem/               # Trained memory vectors
  │     ├── tiny-poe.mem
  │     └── tiny-shakespeare.mem
  └── untrained/          # Optional blank state
        └── morpheus.mem

 ## Output

Trained .mem files which are loaded at runtime to enable contextual responses from the ./morpheus CLI application.

## Next Steps

    Expand .txt training sources

    Add memory growth from user input

    Enable memory pruning and compression for long-term usage
