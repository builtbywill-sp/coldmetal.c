### ✅ What's Inside

- 🧠 `tokenizer.c`: Converts input to raw tokens  
- 🧩 `embedder.c`: Turns tokens into float vectors  
- 🎯 `attention.c`: Computes cosine similarity  
- 🧠 `logic.c`: Selects relevant memories for reply  
- 💾 `memory.c`: Persistent `.mem` file format  
- 🔁 `trainer.c`: Learns from any `.txt` file  
- 🤖 `main.c`: Terminal REPL interface  
- 💸 `mint.c`: $COLD economy for memory value

### 📚 Trained `.mem` Files (So Far)

- `tiny-poe.mem`  
- `dracula.mem`  
- `declaration.mem`  
- `flatland.mem`  
- `history-of-egypt.mem`  
- `gptchatjun-25.mem`  
- `morpheus.mem`  
- And 30+ more…
